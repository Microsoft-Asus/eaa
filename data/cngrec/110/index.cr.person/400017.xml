First, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the outstanding service rendered to the Nation by our men and women in uniform, who, like their forebears, are meeting today's security challenges with true dedication and professionalism. I would also like to thank the..." words="372" />
<cr file="110/h20070514-48" where="h" when="1179158403" ordinal="48" title="Peak Oil" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, this is really a very important day in our history. Exactly 50 years ago today in St. Paul, MN, Admiral Hyman Rickover gave a very famous speech. In a few moments, I will have here a copy of that speech, and I want to spend most of the hour that we have this evening going over that speech, because he was amazingly prophetic. This..." words="8715" />
<cr file="110/h20080422-35" where="h" when="1208880002" ordinal="35" title="Earth Day" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I think that a tipping moment occurred for most Americans when in that spacecraft hurdling toward the Moon they looked back and took a picture of our Earth, how small it was from that vantage point, and we suddenly recognized that the more than 6 billion of us who occupy this Earth ride a rather, in the grand scheme of things, tiny ..." words="732" />
<cr file="110/h20071024-20" where="h" when="1193241604" ordinal="20" title="Celebrating America's Heritage Act" topics="" excerpt="Thank you very much for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1483 and urge my colleagues to vote &quot;no&quot; on this bill. The Journey Through Hallowed Ground is not Mr. Wolf's bill. It is a Democrat substitute bill that has been added to a larger bill, H.R. 1483, that is also a Democrat substitute bill. H.R. 1483 reflects a..." words="871" />
<cr file="110/h20080306-39" where="h" when="1204822801" ordinal="39" title="Fossil Fuels to Renewables" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, in just a few days now will be the third anniversary of the time I came to this floor to talk about this subject. I believe this may be the 39th time that I have come to the floor, and what an auspicious time to come, because when I got up this morning and turned on the television, I could hardly believe it, oil was $105 a barrel. ..." words="9831" />
<cr file="110/h20070131-61" where="h" when="1170262802" ordinal="61" title="Civil Liberties" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, there is a question that often comes to my mind. I wonder to how many Americans this comes to their mind. We are a great superpower, the undisputed economic and military superpower of this world. Have you ever asked yourself why? What is so special about us that we have this privileged position in the world? We no longer..." words="7256" />
<cr file="110/h20071101-48" where="h" when="1193932801" ordinal="48" title="Peak Oil" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, today oil's about $93 a barrel. It was higher than that a couple of days ago. If you look at CNBC, they're still scrolling it in red which means it's kind of out of previous limits. There are two bills before the Congress, and I want to mention those before we start. These would be pretty good bills if we were offering them 25..." words="9412" />
<cr file="110/h20070124-44" where="h" when="1169614800" ordinal="44" title="Energy" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I thought that there was only one speech given in the last century that would become very famous in the few years just ahead of us, and that was the speech given on the 8th day of March in San Antonio, Texas, by M. King Hubbert in 1956, but I just discovered a few days ago a speech which I think may become just about as famous. ..." words="14902" />
<cr file="110/h20080620-46" where="h" when="1213977603" ordinal="46" title="Peak Oil" topics="" excerpt="Thank you, sir. I am honored you came to the floor to join me. Here is a list of the things I have been personally involved in, the Senate 2821, Senators Cantwell and Ensign, passed it 88-8. It's a bill that extends renewable energy tax credits. Our companion bill to that, H.R. 5981, simply picks up the Senate bill. If we pass that bill ..." words="8797" />
<cr file="110/h20080501-53" where="h" when="1209657603" ordinal="53" title="Peak Oil" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I came early to our office yesterday morning, and I opened the door and took the newspapers inside and put them out on the reading table. And as I took them out, seven of them, four newspapers and three of the kind of inside-the-beltway papers, I noted the lead story above the fold. In the Sun there were two stories: &quot;Demand Eats..." words="7845" />
<cr file="110/h20070329-37" where="h" when="1175184011" ordinal="37" title="Campaign Finance Reform and Peak Oil" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to address two very timely items.

<cr file="110/h20070306-81" where="h" when="1173200403" ordinal="81" title="Peak Oil" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I believe this is the 24th time since the 14th day of last March that I have come to this floor to talk about a subject which is growing in importance. That subject is energy. I had the privilege of leading a codel to China. We left just after Christmas and we spent New Year's in Shanghai. There were nine of us who went there..." words="8116" />
<cr file="110/h20070117-77" where="h" when="1169053202" ordinal="77" title="Peak Oil Production" topics="Peak Oil Production: CO" excerpt="What the gentleman has been talking about is more than valid reason for pursuing the development of alternatives, if no other. Why would we want to increase CO 2 more? Why would we want to threaten more the quality of life in this world? The Congressman and I have been to Antarctica twice; one of those trips we went together. Down in..." words="7383" />
<cr file="110/h20080402-58" where="h" when="1207152003" ordinal="58" title="Budget School" topics="" excerpt="I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I thought it might be instructive for the last couple of minutes of this hour to kind of put what we've been talking about in perspective. When you say &quot;budget, &quot;you have to know which budget we're talking about because we have two budgets in Washington. We have the one we talk about..." words="503" />
<cr file="110/h20080410-57" where="h" when="1207843202" ordinal="57" title="Peak Oil" topics="" excerpt="Madam Speaker, I believe that this is the 41st time that I have come to the floor since 3 years ago, the 14th day of March, to talk about energy, specifically about oil. Here is a copy of the Washington Times today.

<cr file="110/h20070315-40" where="h" when="1173974406" ordinal="40" title="From Fossil Fuels to Renewables" topics="" excerpt="I want to thank my friend for joining me. This is absolutely a bipartisan issue. I don't know that energy and oil knows the difference between a Democrat and a Republican. So I am very pleased that you joined me on the floor. I might say just a word about these two philosophies that are keeping us from really focusing on this issue. One is..." words="8569" />
<cr file="110/h20070130-69" where="h" when="1170176402" ordinal="69" title="Energy" topics="" excerpt="Madam Speaker, this is the 22nd time, I believe, that I have come here to the well of the House to talk about a subject which I think will be the overarching concern of our world for the next decades and several decades beyond that.

This phenomenon is what we call peak oil. When I first started talking about this, ..." words="9148" />
<cr file="110/h20080508-52" where="h" when="1210262403" ordinal="52" title="Peak Oil" topics="" excerpt="Thank you very much for your observations. We're doing a number of things in the Congress. It would have been a whole lot better if we were doing them 25, 28 years ago, by the way, because what we're doing in the Congress will not be adequate to meet the challenge. But it's a start. It's what we can do. I have a book here that came..." words="6712" />
<cr file="110/h20070313-63" where="h" when="1173801604" ordinal="63" title="Embryonic Stem Cell Research" topics="" excerpt="Thank you very much. I am very appreciative of the contribution that Dr. Gingrey is making.

Both times I was down we went out to the rookery to see the penguins. The big Emperor penguins, they didn't like us; they waddled off.

Feeling that this was patently..." words="917" />
<cr file="110/h20070118-65" where="h" when="1169139604" ordinal="65" title="Peak Oil" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, last evening we were here just about this time talking about this same subject, the subject we have been talking about for the last hour. We had been discussing the phenomenon known as peak oil. That is the term given to a prediction that a geologist made, M. King Hubbert, working for the Shell Oil Company in 1956. He gave a speech ..." words="8961" />

Most of the founders of our country were deeply religious. You wouldn't know that by reading our textbooks. They have been bled dry of any meaningful reference to how religious our founders were.
