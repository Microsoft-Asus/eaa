Just randomly, you can think of Pearl Harbor, knowing whether the Japanese are coming. Or, particularly, the Battle of Midway, where you have the Japanese force..." words="472" />
<cr file="110/h20071023-75" where="h" when="1193155202" ordinal="75" title="Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act" topics="" excerpt="If I could just interrupt for a minute, I don't think any of us want to impugn anybody's motives. Our objective here is and the reason we were sent here by our constituents is to solve problems, which you have outlined is a reasonable balance between the privacy rights of Americans and the necessity of the government to do what it is number one ..." words="1128" />
<cr file="110/h20070110-34" where="h" when="1168448402" ordinal="34" title="Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007" topics="Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007: AMERICANS DESERVE A RAISE" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, there is a cynic that once said that one of the things that we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history. I don't accept that entirely, but it certainly appears to be that way on the floor of the U.S. Congress today. You don't have to look in the recent past; you go back to 1640 in England. And they had wage and..." words="418" />

<cr file="110/h20070306-73" where="h" when="1173200403" ordinal="73" title="The Enumerated Powers Act" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss and to support the Enumerated Powers Act introduced by Congressman Shadegg. The Enumerated Powers Act is most important to protect the tenth amendment. We understand that with the word &quot;federalism.&quot; People perhaps, though, are not so aware of where the concept of federalism originally came from. They..." words="485" />

Every single one of us has something in common if you are from Congress, and that is that we have people in our districts, some who call themselves pro-life and others who call themselves pro-choice, and many of them are deeply convicted of their views on..." words="623" />

<cr file="110/h20070418-71" where="h" when="1176912003" ordinal="71" title="The Scourge of Abortion In America" topics="" excerpt="I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, today the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the protection of life, and this ruling affirms Congress's role in guarding and protecting that special gift of life. As Justice Kennedy stated, Congress determined that the abortion methods it prescribed had a disturbing similarity to the killing of a newborn..." words="544" />

And I don't think any of us mind, and I certainly don't mind, the accusation by Democrats to say that the war and the situation in Iraq is incompetently planned, or that we should change course, or that we should have bold, new..." words="696" />

The first part says that we support our troops. The second part says that we are not going to send them reinforcements. This seems to be kind of a curious proposition, almost a nonsensical proposition. How do you say you support and then say, but we don't want ..." words="1069" />

I must not have been much of one because I ended up in politics. It doesn't happen that often that people who have an engineering background end up in the political sector; but it is quite common in engineering for..." words="597" />

It has two parts. The first says that we support our troops, and the second says that we are opposed to the mission that the troops are sent on. Now, the problem with the resolution is that it is self-contradictory right up front. If we were..." words="1538" />

I guess it's really not quite so much a plan as just a schedule for failure. It seems ironic to me that when there is actually success, the Democrats are having a hard time seeing the success. And that's, perhaps, because the success that is going on in Iraq is ..." words="361" />
