Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6064, the National Sliver Alert Act, which I authored and on which we have had very good bipartisan cooperation. I appreciate the statement, the concern and cooperation of the gentleman from Florida who has..." words="875" />

We don't think when you talk about entitlements that just cutting grandma's Social Security check or reducing Medicare is the ..." words="657" />
<cr file="110/h20070726-33" where="h" when="1185422400" ordinal="33" title="Providing For Consideration of H.R. 2419, Farm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, farm and ranch families deserve a safety net, and fiscal responsibility demands that we pay for it. We pay for this farm bill, every penny of it, and some of it is done by stopping one group of multinational corporations from dodging their United States tax liability. For too long they have enjoyed a free ride from these..." words="687" />
<cr file="110/h20070205-13" where="h" when="1170694805" ordinal="13" title="Sergeant Henry Ybarra Iii Post Office Building" topics="" excerpt="I thank my colleagues for bringing this bill to the floor.

<cr file="110/h20070215-26" where="h" when="1171515600" ordinal="26" title="Iraq War Resolution" topics="" excerpt="I thank the gentleman. This debate is late, very late, thousands of deaths too late. This escalation scheme is an unmitigated disaster. President Bush seems determined to continue to make the same old mistakes, just make them a little bit bigger; defying sound military judgement; defying the Iraq Study Group; defying the wishes of our..." words="833" />
<cr file="110/h20071010-75" where="h" when="1192032002" ordinal="75" title="End This Endless War In Iraq" topics="" excerpt="Madam Speaker, on this unfortunate day 5 years ago, a majority of this House enabled President Bush to proceed with his tragic &quot;go it alone&quot; war. He was dead certain then, and he was dead wrong then. He is dead certain today, and once again dead wrong. As a result of his choices, we approach now some 4,000 Americans whose lives have been lost..." words="789" />

They're all for our middle class tax relief and extension of important tax incentives; they just don't want to pay for it. They would rather borrow from our grandchildren. &quot;Borrow it, you'll like it.&quot; That's the misguided approach we've followed for 7 long years under this..." words="359" />
<cr file="110/h20070306-35" where="h" when="1173200403" ordinal="35" title="Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building" topics="" excerpt="Madam Speaker, today, we belatedly honor the Education President by affixing his name to the Education Building.

It was a time when he remarked that &quot;poverty was so common we didn't even..." words="469" />
<cr file="110/h20070104-14" where="h" when="1167946162" ordinal="14" title="Rules of The House" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, on this historic day, the sun is shining brightly in Washington outside and today, finally it is shining inside this great Capitol building. Normally, a New Year's resolution is a list you write for yourself. But the ethics package that we Democrats are now adopting was written by the American people at the ballot box in..." words="445" />
<cr file="110/h20070502-32" where="h" when="1178121609" ordinal="32" title="U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007--Veto Message from The President of The United States (H. Doc. No. 110-31)" topics="" excerpt="I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, I believe our Republican colleagues are correct. This Congress spoke with one voice on the war on terrorism, and we continue to do so. Indeed, if President Bush had pursued the war on terrorism and the perpetrators of 9/11, instead of getting diverted to Iraq, which had nothing to do with Ð9/11, then when ..." words="381" />

Res. 312, Concurrent Resolution on The Budget For Fiscal Year 2009" topics="Providing For Consideration of H. Con. Res. 312, Concurrent Resolution on The Budget For Fiscal Year 2009: CENTER ON BUDGET AND" excerpt="I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, some folks think that President Bush's term ends on January 20, 2009. Many Americans have a big red circle or a happy face on their calendar already on that date, or perhaps on their key chains, and their watches that tick down ever so slowly, backwards toward that happy time. But while..." words="522" />
<cr file="110/h20070910-6" where="h" when="1189440002" ordinal="6" title="The Iraq War" topics="" excerpt="Madam Speaker, the troop surge in Iraq has clearly failed. It has failed to achieve its purpose. The troop surge has failed not because of our troops, but because of the failures of politicians here in Washington and in Iraq. This President's surge has been as successful as the President's boast to catch Osama bin Laden &quot;dead or alive.&quot; We..." words="627" />
<cr file="110/h20071107-41" where="h" when="1194454802" ordinal="41" title="Providing For Consideration of H.R. 3688, United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, today we take an important step forward in developing a comprehensive 21st century trade policy, recognizing that the benefits of trade cannot be measured solely in the volume of commerce that crosses international borders.

There was so ..." words="456" />
