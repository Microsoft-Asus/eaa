<cr file="110/s20070424-10" where="s" when="1177387200" ordinal="10" title="Social Security" topics="" excerpt="Mr. President, I rise to turn my attention to a report that was released yesterday, the annual report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and the Disability Insurance Trust Funds. Those are fancy names for what we call Social Security. With yesterday's release, they once again changed their projection as..." words="1579" />

I congratulate the occupant of the chair, Senator Salazar, and Senator Alexander for putting this forward.

July 24 is the day that Brigham Young and the first group of Mormon pioneers came down the canyon outside of Salt Lake Valley and decided that was the place where they..." words="886" />

Let's talk about speculation for a minute. What is it? It is investment on the basis of assumption or expectations. There are those who are investing in oil futures because of the expectation that the price of oil will rise. If you want to get speculation under control, you ..." words="1366" />
<cr file="110/s20070720-8" where="s" when="1184904000" ordinal="8" title="Naked Short Selling" topics="" excerpt="I think the SEC letter goes a long way--the SEC actions go a long way. Without getting too technical about it, they have taken a number of steps to prevent what are called &quot;fails to deliver&quot; and, therefore, to try to stop the naked short-selling situation. But I have discovered something that appears to be a way around the SEC rules. Here..." words="4558" />

Ronald Reagan didn't invent it, but he is known for repeating it, saying there is no limit to the amount of good you can do if you don't care who gets the credit. Far too much of the partisanship stems from the fact that we don't want the other party ..." words="2519" />
<cr file="110/s20071218-6" where="s" when="1197997209" ordinal="6" title="Recognition of The Minority Leader" topics="" excerpt="Madam President, one of the words we often hear as people talk about relationships is the word &quot;mentor.&quot; It is always assumed that the older person mentors the younger person.

Today happens to be the fourth anniversary of the Senate passage of the last of the Bush tax cuts. We have heard a lot of rhetoric around here about those tax cuts.

When ..." words="1098" />
<cr file="110/s20070612-10" where="s" when="1181664006" ordinal="10" title="Energy" topics="" excerpt="I listened with interest to the Senator from Texas. I wish to discuss basically the same thing, perhaps putting a slightly different twist on it. People look at the economics of energy and make this point. They say it costs something like a dollar a barrel to lift the oil in Saudi Arabia. That is the elevating price, a dollar, a dollar and a..." words="1731" />

I have to repeat what I said on the floor before. I may be the only one--I am not sure--who has had experience with the revolving door, as one who went through it.

Hinckley, the oldest serving president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the history, passed away. He was 97 years old.

The notion that imposing timelines would somehow force the Iraqi government to &quot;do the right thing&quot; and thereby resolve the problems in the country is always presented without any evidence. It is..." words="1523" />
