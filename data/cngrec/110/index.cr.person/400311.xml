And there's no doubt about that. But sometimes I think we go back and forth spending more time blaming each other rather than dealing with..." words="1115" />
<cr file="110/h20070329-13" where="h" when="1175184011" ordinal="13" title="Concurrent Resolution on The Budget For Fiscal Year 2008" topics="Concurrent Resolution on The Budget For Fiscal Year 2008: POINT OF ORDER" excerpt="Mr. Chairman, the FY 2008 budget is a monument to irresponsibility and profligacy. It shows that Congress remains oblivious to the economic troubles facing the Nation, and that political expediency trumps all common sense in Washington. To the extent that proponents and supporters of these unsustainable budget increases continue to win..." words="687" />
<cr file="110/h20070117-38" where="h" when="1169053202" ordinal="38" title="Honoring Muhammad Ali on His 65th Birthday" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding this time to me. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 58. I saw Muhammad Ali as a man of great courage, and I admired him for this, not because of the courage that it took to get in a ring and fight men bigger than he, but because of his stance in 1967. In 1967, he was 25 years old. ..." words="379" />
<cr file="110/h20081210-37" where="h" when="1228928403" ordinal="37" title="Auto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense. But I am concerned that we are narrowed down on a problem of the car industry, which is a significant problem, but we are dealing with $15 billion here. But if you look at the grand problem we have, it is much, much bigger, and it seems like we don't pay much..." words="874" />

FEMA..." words="373" />

I want to thank the gentleman from North Carolina for his very determined and principled effort to end this ill-advised and dangerous war, and I am very pleased that he brought together a group of Members today..." words="947" />

Contrary to the claims of its opponents, this bill does not interfere with a free..." words="439" />
<cr file="110/h20080129-29" where="h" when="1201626002" ordinal="29" title="Protect America Act of 2007 Extension" topics="" excerpt="Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the extension of the Protect America Act of 2007 because the underlying legislation violates the U.S. Constitution. The mis-named Protect America Act allows the U.S. government to monitor telephone calls and other electronic communications of American citizens without a warrant. This clearly violates..." words="440" />
<cr file="110/h20070919-29" where="h" when="1190217601" ordinal="29" title="Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007" topics="Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007: IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE" excerpt="Mr. Chairman, six years ago, when the Congress considered the bill creating the terrorism insurance program, I urged my colleagues to reject it. One of the reasons I opposed the bill was my concern that, contrary to the claims of the bill's supporters, terrorism insurance would not be allowed to sunset. As I said then: &quot;The drafters of H.R. ..." words="1134" />
<cr file="110/h20080129-27" where="h" when="1201626002" ordinal="27" title="Recovery Rebates and Economic Stimulus For the American People Act of 2008" topics="Recovery Rebates and Economic Stimulus For the American People Act of 2008: PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY" excerpt="Madame Speaker, I find it odd that H.R. 5140, a bill allegedly designed to provide a stimulus for the anemic American economy, contains provisions that could damage the economy and hurt American taxpayers. Specifically, the provisions increasing the loan limitations of the Federal Housing Administration and the Government Sponsored Enterprises (..." words="807" />
<cr file="110/h20070105-22" where="h" when="1168016404" ordinal="22" title="The War In Iraq" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, Saddam Hussein is dead. So are 3,000 Americans. The regime in Iraq has been changed; yet victory will not be declared. Not only does the war go on; it is about to escalate. Obviously, the turmoil in Iraq is worse than ever and most Americans no longer are willing to tolerate the costs, both human and economic, associated with this..." words="744" />
<cr file="110/h20070712-29" where="h" when="1184212800" ordinal="29" title="Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act" topics="Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act: WOODROW WILSON INTERNATIONAL" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2956 which, while a well-intended attempt to reduce our nation's seemingly unlimited military commitment in Iraq, is in so many respects deeply flawed. I have been one of the strongest opponents of military action against Iraq. I voted against the initial authorization in 2002 and I have voted..." words="596" />
<cr file="110/h20070307-55" where="h" when="1173286803" ordinal="55" title="The Scandal At Walter Reed" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, the scandal at Walter Reed is not an isolated incident. It is directly related to our foreign policy of interventionism. There is a pressing need to reassess our now widely accepted role as the world's lone superpower. If we don't, we are destined to reduce our Nation to something far less powerful. It has always been..." words="688" />
<cr file="110/h20070320-47" where="h" when="1174406404" ordinal="47" title="The Real Reason to Oppose the Supplemental Appropriation" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, a $124 billion supplemental appropriation is a good bill, to oppose. I am pleased that many of my colleagues will join me in voting against this measure. If one is unhappy with our progress in Iraq after 4 years of war, voting to defund the war makes sense. If one is unhappy with the manner in which we went to war without a..." words="810" />
<cr file="110/h20081210-26" where="h" when="1228928403" ordinal="26" title="Providing For Consideration of H.R. 7321, Auto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act" topics="" excerpt="I do believe in the transition. That is, if we need a bailout for the car companies, even though I don't like the idea, if you could pay for it, take it out of these hundreds of billions of dollars running the American empire around the world. Cut it; bring it home and spend it here, but running up of these deficits is going to do us in, and we ..." words="664" />
<cr file="110/h20070607-33" where="h" when="1181232007" ordinal="33" title="Unanticipated Good Results (When We Leave)" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I would like to discuss the irrationality of our current foreign policy and the expected concrete benefits of changing that policy. First, we need to look at the inconsistent and counterproductive way we currently treat other nations. We reward and respect nations with nuclear weapons. Look at how we treat Russia, China..." words="817" />
<cr file="110/h20070730-48" where="h" when="1185768000" ordinal="48" title="Iran Sanctions Enabling Act of 2007" topics="Iran Sanctions Enabling Act of 2007: COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose any move to initiate further sanctions on Iran. Sanctions are acts of war, and expanding sanctions on Iran serves no purpose other than preparing the American people for an eventual attack on Iran. This is the same pattern we saw in the run up to the war on Iraq: Congress passes legislation calling for regime..." words="478" />
<cr file="110/h20070522-71" where="h" when="1179871463" ordinal="71" title="Patriotism" topics="" excerpt="Madam Speaker, for some, patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel. For others, it means dissent against a government's abuse of the people's rights. I have never met a politician in Washington or any American, for that matter, who chose to be called unpatriotic. Nor have I met anyone who did not believe he wholeheartedly supported our..." words="3365" />
<cr file="110/h20070606-74" where="h" when="1181145609" ordinal="74" title="Unanticipated Good Results (When We Leave)" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, good intentions frequently lead to unintended bad consequences. Tough choices, doing what is right, often leads to unanticipated good results. The growing demand by the American people for us to leave Iraq prompts the naysayers to predict disaster in the Middle East if we do. Of course, these merchants of fear are the same ones ..." words="1145" />
<cr file="110/h20070207-49" where="h" when="1170867604" ordinal="49" title="Does Anybody Care? Has Anybody Noticed?" topics="" excerpt="Madam Speaker, does anybody care, has anybody noticed, that: Our policy toward Iran is hostile and provocative, and thus war seems inevitable? That we have seized Iranians in Iraq, who claim they are diplomats, and now we have announced that any Iranians found in Iraq may be shot? Has anybody noticed that large numbers of Iranians..." words="738" />
<cr file="110/h20070118-47" where="h" when="1169139604" ordinal="47" title="Everyone Supports the Troops" topics="" excerpt="Madam Speaker, I have never met anyone who did not support our troops. Sometimes, however, we hear accusations that someone or some group does not support the men and women serving in our Armed Forces. But this is pure demagoguery, and it is intellectually dishonest. The accusers play on emotions to gain support for controversial policies..." words="661" />
<cr file="110/h20070110-37" where="h" when="1168448402" ordinal="37" title="Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007" topics="Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007: CLOSING REMARKS" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, the announced purpose of H.R. 2 is to raise living standards for all Americans. This is certainly an admirable goal, however, to believe that Congress can raise the standard of living for working Americans by simply forcing employers to pay their employees a higher wage is equivalent to claiming that Congress can repeal gravity by..." words="561" />
<cr file="110/h20081003-15" where="h" when="1223049602" ordinal="15" title="Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008" topics="Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008: STUDENT LOANS" excerpt="Madam Speaker, only in Washington could a bill demonstrably worse than its predecessor be brought back for another vote and actually expect to gain votes. That this bailout was initially defeated was a welcome surprise, but the power-brokers in Washington and on Wall Street could not allow that defeat to be permanent. It was most unfortunate..." words="982" />
<cr file="110/h20070111-42" where="h" when="1168534804" ordinal="42" title="Escalation Is Hardly the Answer" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, a military victory in Iraq is unattainable, just as it was in the Vietnam War. At the close of the Vietnam War in 1975, a telling conversation took place between a North Vietnamese colonel named Tu and an American colonel named Harry Summers. Colonel Summers said to Tu, You know, you never beat us on the battlefield. And Tu replied,..." words="668" />

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill. I happen to agree with all of the concerns expressed by those sponsoring the bill due to the inequities in the amount of money that some of the CEOs are getting. But I am also convinced that this particular piece of legislation..." words="1073" />
<cr file="110/h20070730-47" where="h" when="1185768000" ordinal="47" title="Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, H.R. 180 is premised on the assumption that. divestment, sanctions, and other punitive measures are effective in influencing repressive regimes, when in fact nothing could be further from the truth. Proponents of such methods fail to remember that where goods cannot cross borders, troops will. Sanctions against Cuba, Iraq, and..." words="387" />

While I sympathize with those who see embryonic stem cell research as providing a path to a cure for the dreadful diseases that have stricken so many Americans, I strongly object to forcing those Americans who..." words="458" />
