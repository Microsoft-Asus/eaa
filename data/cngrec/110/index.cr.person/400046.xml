<cr file="110/h20071010-37" where="h" when="1192032002" ordinal="37" title="Tax Collection Responsibility Act of 2007" topics="" excerpt="I will be brief, Mr. Speaker. We hear a lot of claims today about the efficiency of this program. But our agencies, the independent agencies, the Government Accountability Office and Joint Tax, make the point attached to this legislation that this program has worked, is working efficiently, and will save U.S. taxpayers more than $1 billion. ..." words="2108" />
<cr file="110/h20071109-23" where="h" when="1194627601" ordinal="23" title="Temporary Tax Relief Act of 2007" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, make no mistake, there are good things in this bill. I think it's important that we address the AMT. It was created in 1969 by a Democrat Congress for the wealthy. Now it's affecting our teachers and our firefighters and just average families. There is a State and local sales tax deduction in this bill, very important for..." words="359" />
<cr file="110/h20070110-34" where="h" when="1168448402" ordinal="34" title="Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007" topics="Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007: CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I think we are missing a historic opportunity to change the paradigm to really help workers get into a living wage for the long term. The fact is, an increase to $7.25 an hour will still leave a single mom with a child at or near poverty. And there is no doubt that a video store owner in Texas or anywhere else with five workers..." words="369" />

Even though only 3 percent of this country's jobs are affected by trade, if it's your job, it's an important one. But when workers try to get help, what they find is this program is bureaucratic and inefficient and slow to..." words="408" />

The gentleman does make many relevant points, just not relevant accuracies. The truth of the matter is he claimed that the Democrats balanced the budget in 1994, but there was a $200 billion deficit in 1994. In fact, it was the Republican Congress that balanced the Federal budget..." words="1985" />

I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. I don't know where those fairy tales come from, I don't mean from the gentlelady, but some of these special interest groups. But I'm looking at the budget, page 37, I look at this title III called &quot;reserve funds.&quot; It doesn't have any money in it, but it is..." words="2250" />
<cr file="110/h20070925-55" where="h" when="1190736002" ordinal="55" title="Extending Trade Adjustment Assistance Program" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I agree with the previous speakers as well that there are lots of challenges that face American workers these days. And whether it is from competition here at home or competition from abroad, technology, or just the fact that our economy continues to transition, families..." words="634" />
<cr file="110/h20071108-65" where="h" when="1194541202" ordinal="65" title="Tax Burden In America" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for pointing out we do have a choice between higher taxes and tightening our belt here in Washington, D.C. As a Republican, as a conservative, I'm convinced that the reason Republicans got fired from their job of leading Congress is that we didn't balance the budget. We didn't secure the..." words="2344" />
<cr file="110/h20071004-28" where="h" when="1191513602" ordinal="28" title="Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, if you lose your job and lose your home or are forced to sell at a loss, only in America do you get a bill, a tax bill from Uncle Sam for forgiven debt. Having witnessed this during the terrible Texas recession of the 1980s, it is nothing less than shooting the financially wounded. There's no question this is long past time to..." words="371" />

Yet we won't do more to help the refundable child tax credit. Those are single parents who are usually raising one or two kids and working several jobs. We offered the amendment. Instead of helping a trial lawyer buy a second..." words="402" />
<cr file="110/h20080717-29" where="h" when="1216310404" ordinal="29" title="Drill Responsibly In Leased Lands Act of 2008" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, it is a very unfortunate time when families are struggling to try to make ends meet with these energy prices, small businesses too. Basically, Congress is debating a bait-and-switch piece of legislation. Democrats are hoping that the American public isn't smart enough to realize there are two oil fields in Alaska--ANWR, the one ..." words="447" />
<cr file="110/h20070215-26" where="h" when="1171515600" ordinal="26" title="Iraq War Resolution" topics="Iraq War Resolution: LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM" excerpt="Madam Speaker, watching television late last night I was reminded of the vivid contrast between Congress and the war on terror. On the one channel I watched Members of the House theatrically debating this nonbinding, that means pretend, resolution, while the other channel showed an American chopper hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and..." words="969" />

Carol White, a long-time Chief of Staff for Senator TED STEVENS, who aptly named this program because they have dedicated their lives to trying to make this country better inside our schools and out. This..." words="613" />

I recently did a tour of our manufacturing plants. We have over 300 of them in the Eighth Congressional District of Texas from steel mills to paper mills. I watched the workers on those lines working every day to produce those products. Between one-third and one-half of those products are made for sales ..." words="787" />
<cr file="110/h20080611-42" where="h" when="1213200004" ordinal="42" title="Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2008" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, economically, our Nation is a Nation of thirds. One-third of our States face steep economic challenges, one-third are chugging along with their traditional economies, and one-third are enjoying strong job growth and, in fact, record low unemployment. This measure is well-intended. There's no question about it. But compassion..." words="368" />
<cr file="110/h20070118-19" where="h" when="1169139604" ordinal="19" title="Motion to Adjourn" topics="Motion to Adjourn: E.O. 12988 , PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY" excerpt="Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 6, the &quot;Clean Energy Act of 2007.&quot; I agree with Democrats that we need to invest more in renewable energy, including new ways to fuel our cars. But by taxing American companies more for exploring and creating jobs here at home--and letting foreign oil companies off the hook--this bill says..." words="1041" />

It is despicable to have a Member of this Congress accuse this President, any President, of willfully blowing the heads, quote, blowing the heads off our young men and women over in Iraq and Afghanistan. Having a brother who is an Army medic and served in Iraq, having spent this weekend with a..." words="353" />
