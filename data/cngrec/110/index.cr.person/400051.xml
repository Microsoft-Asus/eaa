I think Americans are disappointed. I think with the change in leadership in the House of Representatives as well as in the Senate, the people thought things were going to be improved. Kind of like when you buy a new container of detergent, it might say New and Improved. Well, I have to say, it's..." words="832" />

Lea Mills Post Office" topics="" excerpt="Madam Speaker, I rise today about my bill, H.R. 514, which passed the House earlier today.

Then Senator Ginny Brown-Waite..." words="629" />
