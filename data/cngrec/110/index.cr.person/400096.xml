<cr file="110/h20070214-34" where="h" when="1171472405" ordinal="34" title="Iraq War Resolution" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of our military men and women. I will strongly support our soldiers serving in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan. I support all off our veterans, men and women who have served our country with great honor and distinction, and because of my support for our military men and women, I also rise in..." words="1000" />
<cr file="110/h20070522-67" where="h" when="1179871463" ordinal="67" title="Democratic Blue Dog Coalition" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for the recognition. I'll be very brief, which is difficult for me to do, being from the mountains of Tennessee. Sometimes I get a little wordy. I had one of my folks back home tell me that after I'd been here for about a year, he said, LINCOLN, you've gotten so windy as those folks in Washington,..." words="1077" />
<cr file="110/h20070424-87" where="h" when="1177387200" ordinal="87" title="Economic Observations by The 43 Member Strong, Fiscally Conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition" topics="" excerpt="As we move now, I want to move briefly to the accusing tone we often hear that Democrats are big government. When Bill Clinton became President in 1992, and was sworn in 1993, the government had grown to 22.4 percent of gross domestic income. When he became the President, working with the Republican Congress in 1995, we saw a government..." words="1931" />
<cr file="110/h20071002-88" where="h" when="1191340802" ordinal="88" title="Blue Dog Coalition" topics="" excerpt="In essence what that component says is that in a bipartisan way we want to be sure that the Iraqis have a surge in leadership for their own country, take over the control of their own country; that the Iraqis develop the military that they need to occupy their own country themselves. And, secondly, that they become the policemen in the field..." words="2156" />
<cr file="110/h20070122-55" where="h" when="1169489305" ordinal="55" title="Blue Dog Coalition" topics="" excerpt="Congressman Ross, thanks very much. I will be very brief. During the campaign in November, October and September, obviously leading up to the November 7 election, I heard a great deal from those who would be talking about, do you favor cut and run or stay the course? I submit to you that neither of those are good alternatives. And the..." words="522" />
<cr file="110/h20070712-29" where="h" when="1184212800" ordinal="29" title="Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. The responsible redeployment of our troops is a brave step toward a new direction for the war in Iraq. It will remove our troops from the most dangerous kill zones in Iraq and refocus our efforts toward defeating terrorism across the globe. The decision to redeploy is one that I have not..." words="582" />
<cr file="110/h20070904-54" where="h" when="1188956525" ordinal="54" title="The National Debt and The War In Iraq" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, one of the things we really need to make sure of is that the American public as they watch this Blue Dog Coalition group here talk tonight, every one of us to the &quot;T&quot; comes from rural areas basically. We love America, we love our troops, we visit them. I have been to Iraq five times and Afghanistan twice. I went for a reason..." words="2423" />
<cr file="110/h20080917-57" where="h" when="1221667203" ordinal="57" title="Sense of Congress Regarding Lowering Flag Over Capitol to Honor Military Deaths" topics="" excerpt="I thank the gentlelady from California. All of us, I'm sure, have had an opportunity--at least most--to visit the war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. And being there, we have observed the greatness of the volunteers who volunteer their service for this great country and to help preserve, defend, and to bring about liberty and freedom to..." words="648" />
<cr file="110/h20070206-71" where="h" when="1170781203" ordinal="71" title="Blue Dog Coalition" topics="" excerpt="I so often hear that cut and run is a strategy from Democrats. That is not the case. When we finished the war in 1945, military bases were established in western Europe, in Turkey and other places throughout the world. They are still there. As we finished our endeavors, as many people thought during the Korean War, our military bases are still..." words="1147" />
<cr file="110/h20070116-53" where="h" when="1168966803" ordinal="53" title="The Blue Dog Coalition" topics="" excerpt="When we talk about different coalitions, obviously there are many in this particular Congress, probably some several hundred different caucuses that deal with health care, deal with many different issues. But the one caucus in this House that deals with fiscal responsibility and a strong national defense basically is the Blue Dog Coalition. And ..." words="739" />
<cr file="110/h20070227-54" where="h" when="1172595604" ordinal="54" title="The Budget, Debt and The Blue Dog's Iraq Accountability Legislation" topics="" excerpt="I thank my friend from Georgia. I think, what my hope is, all of us become a little bit more civil in this debate that we are having and realize that this is about America. We want security and we want peace. We want the Iraqis to win. What we have done is destroyed an Army in Iraq and I agree with that, we have destroyed an Army in Iraq..." words="1843" />

This war is in desperate need of a new direction. For nearly 5 years, our brave men and women have valiantly toed the line for this administration, and I'm proud to say that they have had great successes in their mission...." words="511" />
