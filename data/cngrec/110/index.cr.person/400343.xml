Henry Hyde was no doubt one of the greatest Members ever to serve in this Chamber. He was certainly one of the most articulate. Let me note right off the beginning, Henry Hyde was a personal hero of mine long before I arrived here in this body in 1989. And unlike heroes who I have met..." words="930" />
<cr file="110/h20071016-53" where="h" when="1192550402" ordinal="53" title="Honoring the 60th Anniversary of The Aeronautics Research Accomplishments Embodied In &quot;The Breaking of The Sound Barrier&quot;" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Lampson and Mr. Feeney for their hard work they have been doing here, not just on this legislation but overseeing America's space program. You certainly have my respect and my support, and I'm happy today for their support for this legislation. This bill takes note and honors America's historic aeronautic..." words="644" />
<cr file="110/h20071001-47" where="h" when="1191254402" ordinal="47" title="National Security and American Foreign Policy" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, tonight I'd like to share a few thoughts about national security and about American foreign policy.

<cr file="110/h20070110-34" where="h" when="1168448402" ordinal="34" title="Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007" topics="Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007: CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this proposal to increase the minimum wage by $2.10 an hour over the next 2 years. What we are witnessing today, of course, is the quintessential example of political figures offering something for nothing. We can just bestow upon the American people $2.10 an hour, and there is no cost to it. Well, if..." words="511" />
<cr file="110/h20071025-42" where="h" when="1193328001" ordinal="42" title="Be Prepared" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, &quot;Be prepared&quot; is the motto of the Boy Scouts of America. Unfortunately, for those Californians now in harm's way, the leadership of the U.S. Forest Service doesn't have the same commitment. Three years ago, the fleet of airplanes with firefighting capabilities available to the Forest Service declined dramatically, due to both..." words="1424" />

A major flaw reflects what I believe, I think I state, a wrongheaded approach which is favored perhaps by the new majority of this current Congress. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of a motion that will be offered later,..." words="467" />
<cr file="110/h20070423-32" where="h" when="1177344482" ordinal="32" title="Expressing Sorrow of The House At the Death of The Honorable Juanita Millender-Mcdonald, Member of Congress from The State of California" topics="" excerpt="Madam Speaker, I lost two people who were very dear to me this last week, and one was my brother, who passed away Thursday morning, and JUANITA, who just passed away on Sunday. It is really an amazing thing as I have thought about this, just about how similar these two people were, because my brother was very, very active in politics, but..." words="602" />
<cr file="110/h20070207-75" where="h" when="1170867604" ordinal="75" title="Free Border Patrol Agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, today we discuss a black mark on this administration, a vile crime against two law enforcement officers whose job has been protecting our families and communities and keeping control of America's borders.

We can do something about this. You know, first of all, it has been a dismay to me to see how we have treated each other in this body. I don't know why, but people are looking to bring down each other because people disagree. We can understand that with philosophical..." words="1787" />
<cr file="110/h20070906-53" where="h" when="1189094404" ordinal="53" title="Patent Reform Act" topics="Patent Reform Act: COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS" excerpt="I appreciate that. I think that we need to understand that there are so many parts of this bill, as Mr. Manzullo has pointed out, whether we are talking about damages or whether we are talking about challenges before and after the patent can be filed and hoops to be jumped through, each and every one of them designed basically to thwart the ..." words="7408" />
<cr file="110/h20070907-15" where="h" when="1189180801" ordinal="15" title="Providing For Consideration of H.R. 1908, Patent Reform Act of 2007" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule, as well as opposition to the underlying legislation. Let us note that this debate has been limited today, which is consistent with the substance of this legislation. The process, as well as the substance of H.R. 1908 is totally unacceptable. This bill should be called the Steal American..." words="682" />
<cr file="110/h20070905-74" where="h" when="1189008002" ordinal="74" title="American Patent Law" topics="" excerpt="People need to know that H.R. 1908 will be coming to the floor on Friday. I call it the &quot;Steal America's Technology Act,&quot; and we need to defeat this bill. We need to have the support of the public and of our colleagues, and we are asking for that support today. I would like to close with one story. It is a story of a statue of a man..." words="8025" />
<cr file="110/h20070319-59" where="h" when="1174320004" ordinal="59" title="Our Southern Border" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, today I discuss a black mark on this administration. And while I realize this is the fourth anniversary, and I have enjoyed the comments of colleagues, comments with which I may have some disagreement, I would like to discuss another issue. Because no matter what we do in Iraq, one way or the other, whether we succeed there or not, ..." words="10195" />
<cr file="110/h20071017-40" where="h" when="1192636802" ordinal="40" title="Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2007" topics="" excerpt="I yield myself the balance of my time. Again, I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar for his support and partnership in this. I would hope that we start with a demonstration at the Port of Los Angeles/Long Beach, whereas it would take tens of thousands of trucks off the road just there, but something that would be a model for the rest of..." words="686" />

<cr file="110/h20070129-47" where="h" when="1170090025" ordinal="47" title="Persevere and Triumph Over Our Foe" topics="" excerpt="Mr. Speaker, 271 years ago, American patriot and champion of human liberty, Thomas Paine, was born. His pamphlet &quot;Common Sense&quot; is credited with convincing the people of what was then the 13 colonies to declare themselves independent and committed to representative government and human liberty. Paine was thus instrumental in bringing about..." words="863" />
<cr file="110/h20070307-31" where="h" when="1173286803" ordinal="31" title="Water Quality Investment Act of 2007" topics="Water Quality Investment Act of 2007: POINT OF ORDER" excerpt="Mr. Chairman, I believe my amendment is germane. After all, we do add many such regulations on bills that we pass. They have to meet certain standards. This standard certainly is no different than many of the other standards. It is just that this body refuses ever to involve themselves in anything that would stem the flow of illegal..." words="547" />

<cr file="110/h20070522-72" where="h" when="1179871463" ordinal="72" title="Illegal Immigration" topics="" excerpt="Madam Speaker, a tsunami of illegal aliens is sweeping into our country, crowding our classrooms, closing our hospital emergency rooms, unleashing violent crime, and driving down wages.
