It's Solano Beach, California. I know one beach is like the other. I was raised in one, but live in Carlsbad. But I would just like to clarify. This resolution is recognizing the men and women who were fighting on the front line. And I think there are two big advantages we had in San Diego. San Diego County lost over..." words="620" />
<cr file="110/h20070105-13" where="h" when="1168016404" ordinal="13" title="Rules of The House" topics="" excerpt="Madam Speaker, I think everyone will agree, when it came to earmarks, the big concern about the abuses of the past were two components: one is transparency or the lack of transparency in previous proceedings when it came to earmarks.

And, Mr. Speaker, when we talk about a visa and we talk about a proposal to go to a $10 visa processing fee, I go to Latin America on most of my family's casual time; it is kind of the untold story that the chairman of the Immigration Caucus spends so much time in Latin America. But they charge $10 for a visa and you go..." words="2665" />
