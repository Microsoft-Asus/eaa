  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="CONGRATULATING MOOSEHEAD MANUFACTURING COMPANY">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Moosehead Manufacturing Company, a small firm in Monson, Maine, that will soon be reopening its doors. For 60 years, Moosehead Manufacturing had been a thriving business that exemplified the quality of Maine production. Unfortunately, after facing tough challenges from the global economy earlier this year, Moosehead ceased production. With the help of new investors, the company recently announced that it will recommence production and hire 40  employees in Monson, continuing its legacy of providing quality furniture to the State of Maine and beyond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moosehead Manufacturing specializes in producing exceptional Maine-made furniture. The company prides itself on the durable and hand-finished aspects of its products, which it offers to consumers at competitive prices. Not only does Moosehead Manufacturing provide valuable employment opportunities, it procures all of its production resources from within the State, helping Maine's economy. The furniture is built from hardwoods harvested from neighboring forests, cut in Moosehead's own saw mills,  and dried in its own kilns. Moosehead has been described as "an amazing corporate citizen" by Tom Lizotte, a Piscataquis county commissioner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moosehead Manufacturing was founded in 1947 by the Wentworth family. At its peak of production in the late 1990s, it was the largest privately owned furniture factory in New England, employing about 250 workers. Recently, increasing imports of cheap, foreign-made furniture have threatened Moosehead's business. In 2003, Moosehead Manufacturing joined a group of furniture makers nationwide in petitioning the Government to place duties on some of the furniture that China imports to the United States.  I echoed their sentiments in a letter I sent to Secretary of Commerce Evans stating my deep concern with the impact Chinese imports were having on  the small and midsized American companies fighting to compete. The problem reached a climax when Moosehead announced its closure in February</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, three new buyers recently stepped forward to save Moosehead Manufacturing: Joshua Tardy, the minority leader of the Maine House of Representatives; Dana Connors, president of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce; and Ed Skovron, a financier from Rhode Island. Under the continued management of John Wentworth, Moosehead will soon resume production in Monson, much to the relief of Piscataquis County, and will return to making longlasting furniture in which Mainers can take pride.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moosehead Manufacturing's reopening is exciting for the economic prospects of both Monson and Maine. Not only does it provide necessary employment opportunities, but it also sets a precedent for continued, Maine-based manufacturing established on quality and durability in the face of an increasingly competitive global market. I wish the owners and employees of Moosehead Manufacturing Company continued success in the coming years. I look forward to its exciting return to Maine's business scene.</paragraph>
