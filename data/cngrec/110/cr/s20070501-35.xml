    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the tragic deaths of women and girls in Guatemala, and to submit a resolution urging increased U.S. involvement in addressing this serious issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 2001, more than 2,000 women and girls have been murdered in Guatemala. The murder rate of these women almost doubled from 2001 to 2006, increasing at a higher rate than the murder rate of men. While these killings may be due to a variety of factors, what clearly unifies these cases is the fact that very few of the perpetrators have been brought to justice. Indeed, it is my understanding that as of 2006 there have been only 20 convictions for these killings. In some of the cases police have  been implicated in the crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The lack of respect for the rule of law, inadequate legal protections for women, ongoing violence in the country, corruption, insufficient resources, substandard investigations, and the lack of independent and effective judicial and prosecutorial systems, all contribute to the inability of the Government of Guatemala to hold those responsible for these killings accountable for their crimes. The result is a general sense of impunity for crimes against women in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Government of Guatemala has taken some steps to address these killings. Guatemala has created special police and prosecutorial units to investigate these murders, and repealed the so called "Rape Law" which had absolved perpetrators of criminal responsibility for rape upon the perpetrator's marriage with the victim. The Government also recently entered into an agreement with the United Nations to establish the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, CICIG, which has a mandate  to investigate and prosecute illegal security groups operating with impunity. And Guatemala established the National Institute for Forensic Sciences to improve investigatory and evidence gathering efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution I am submitting today is aimed at raising awareness of this issue and encouraging the governments of Guatemala and the United States to work together to stop these killings. Among other things, the resolution: condemns these murders and expresses the sympathy of the Senate to the families of women and girls murdered in Guatemala; encourages the Government of Guatemala to act with due diligence in investigating and prosecuting those responsible for these crimes; urges the Government  of Guatemala to recognize domestic violence as a criminal act and to provide adequate resources necessary to strengthen the integrity of the prosecutorial and judicial systems; urges the President and the Secretary of State to incorporate this issue into the bilateral agenda between the governments of Guatemala and the United States; and encourages the Secretary</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution and give this issue the attention it deserves.</paragraph>
