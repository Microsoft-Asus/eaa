    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Linthicum Heights, MD, on its 100th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Linthicum Heights is a suburb of Baltimore that is also located near Annapolis and Washington, DC. Close to rail lines and good roads, Linthicum offers location without sacrificing its suburban character and historic property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Linthicum is on the National Register of Historic Places. The community was farmland until 1908, when the decendents of Abner Linthicum decided to sell the farm land for houses. They created the Linthicum Heights Realty Company and named their development Linthicum Heights. Many of the original homes on the farm property remain. Two of the most famous are Turkey Hill, built in 1822 by William Linthicum, and Twin Oaks, which was home to U.S. Congressman John Charles Linthicum, who represented  the Fourth Congressional District of Maryland from 1911 to 1932. U.S. Representative Linthicum was a sponsor of the legislation that named "The Star Spangled Banner" as our national anthem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Linthicum's location and its historic nature remain its charm and attraction. Easy access to Baltimore, Washington, DC, and Annapolis and its close proximity to Baltimore Washington Thurgood Marshall International Airport, Fort George G. Meade, Goddard Space Flight Center, and numerous other Federal facilities make Linthicum a desirable place to live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The residents of Linthicum Heights as well as the Woman's Club of Linthicum Heights, the Linthicum-Shipley Improvement Association, the North Linthicum Improvement Association, business leaders, and government officials are to be congratulated for their appreciation and steadfast support of Linthicum Heights and its history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating Linthicum Heights on its 100th anniversary.</paragraph>
