  <narrative>SENATOR DICK DURBIN -- (Senate - September 26, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9559">S9559</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I came to the floor and waiting was my friend, Senator Durbin of Illinois, the assistant Democratic leader. He is always available. Whenever the Senate needs him or I have a problem, he is the first person I call. He gets little notoriety or credit for all the work he does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We came to Washington together in 1982 as freshmen Members of the House of Representatives. I have had the good fortune of being able to serve with him for some 26 years. He is such a good friend, such a great orator, has such a great mind. He is such a great asset to the Senate, to me, and, of course, to the State of Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate calling him, as I do many mornings, and he is there very quickly. He helps me work through the day's issues. I publicly acknowledge what a good Senator he is and what a good friend he is.</paragraph>
