    <paragraph>Intellectual property is the lifeblood of our economy, and protecting that property from theft and misappropriation is important to preserving our place at the economic forefront of the world. Combatting intellectual property offenses can help us save jobs for Americans, increase tax revenues from legitimate businesses, and bolster our productivity, with all the gains that come from that. Some of the provisions in this bill authorize significant resources to the Department of Justice  and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to better take on the tasks of battling intellectual property crimes. I have confidence in law enforcement, and I also take seriously the obligation we have in the Congress to ensure that the public's money is well and responsibly spent.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I am glad that the Senator from Vermont is making this commitment and am relying on his assurance of oversight of these programs so that our government is held responsible and informed decisions are made on how to responsibly allocate our scarce Federal dollars. Although the criteria we established in this legislation are necessary, they will neither have an effect on how the Justice Department and FBI prioritize and use the funds authorized under this bill, nor ensure grantees appropriately  use Federal grant dollars, unless we make certain these agencies rigorously follow the standards we set forth in this legislation. If the Justice Department and FBI continue to receive Federal funding year after year without Congress questioning the contents of their required reports or grantees' use of funds, all of the efforts of those supporting this bill will be for naught, and we will not have succeeded in making IP enforcement a priority for this country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the impending passage of <bill type="s" number="3325">S. 3325</bill>, the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights Act of 2008/Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I first reviewed the bill, I was concerned that section 301's creation of the intellectual property enforcement coordinator, or IPEC, a presidentially appointed White House officer, might allow political interference with the Justice Department's copyright investigation and enforcement decisions. I am now persuaded, however, that the bill's creation of this new office does not, and was not intended to, influence the exercise of prosecutorial and law enforcement decisionmaking by the Department  of Justice and other law enforcement agencies. Criminal law enforcement is a critical component of Federal enforcement of intellectual property rights, and the bill includes language that prevents the IPEC from exercising any control over criminal investigations and prosecutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, the bill contains several important limitations on the authority of the IPEC. Section 301(b)(2) of the bill provides that the IPEC "may not control or direct any law enforcement agency, including the Department of Justice, in the exercise of its investigative or prosecutorial authority." Section 305(b) further provides that "nothing in this title shall alter the authority of any department or agency of the United States (including any independent agency) that relates to--(1) the  investigation and prosecution of violations of laws that protect intellectual property rights; (2) the administrative enforcement, at the borders of the United States, of laws that protect intellectual property rights." Section 306(c) also provides that "Nothing in this title--(1) shall derogate from the powers, duties, and functions of any of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The foregoing provisions of the bill make clear that the IPEC does not, and was not intended to, have the authority to influence or attempt to influence the law enforcement and prosecutorial decisionmaking of the Department of Justice and its law enforcement partners. Rather, the IPEC's role is limited to general coordination, as defined in the statute, that does not interfere with, or derogate from, the existing prosecutorial and law enforcement authority and responsibilities of the Department  of Justice and other law enforcement agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this understanding in mind, I interpose no objection to the Senate's adoption of this bill and will lend my support to its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President I support the overall goals of <bill type="s" number="3325">S. 3325</bill>, the PRO-IP Act, and believe that our country's intellectual property rights should be protected at home and abroad. However, I believe that Congress should make both realistic and fiscally responsible commitments in the legislation it passes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Intellectual property is important to our country, businesses, and individual rights holders. Illegal importation of counterfeit goods, such as pharmaceuticals, also threatens the health and safety of U.S. citizens. It is necessary for the Federal Government to protect and enforce intellectual property rights domestically and internationally.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I believe that the only way to ensure these agencies actually answer for their actions, and make intellectual property enforcement a priority, is through effective oversight by this Body. We have included in this bill two reporting requirements for the Justice Department and FBI that will make certain we know: (1) exactly what the agencies were doing before this bill was enacted to enforce intellectual property laws so that we may establish a performance baseline, and (2) what the agencies will  be doing in the future as a result of this bill. We have also included other standards for State and local law enforcement agencies that will be receiving grants from the Justice Department, so that the grantees also have standards to meet in order to receive Federal funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These reports and standards, however, will neither have an effect on how these agencies prioritize and use the funds authorized under this bill, nor ensure grantees appropriately use Federal funds unless we make certain the criteria we set forth in this bill are met. If the Justice Department and FBI continue to receive funding year after year under this legislation without Congress questioning the contents of the reports they are required to submit, all of the efforts of those supporting this  bill will be for naught, and we will not have succeeded in making intellectual property enforcement a priority for this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To be clear, I would prefer actual language in this bill stating that, if the Justice Department and FBI fail to submit their reports on time, any authorizations under title IV of this bill would be suspended until those reports are submitted. However, even though this language was not accepted, the Senator from Vermont has assured me that the Judiciary Committee will hold oversight hearings early each year so we may thoroughly question the contents of the reports required to be submitted by  the Justice Department and FBI under title IV. It is my hope that the outcome of any oversight hearings in the Judiciary Committee related to the content of this bill will be effectively communicated to the Appropriations Committee so that the members of that committee will have detailed information to establish whether these agencies have complied with the requirements of <bill type="s" number="3325">S. 3325</bill>, and enable them to make informed decision on how to responsibly allocate our scarce Federal dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Pennsylvania for their work on this bill.

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senators Specter, Leahy, Bayh, and others in strong support of <bill type="s" number="3325">S. 3325</bill>, the Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act of 2008, PRO IP Act, which was just approved unanimously by the Senate today. First, I would ike to express my appreciation to Senator Specter and Senator Leahy for the excellent job they have done in ensuring that the Senate passed this important  piece of legislation before we complete our business for the year. I would like to thank Senator Bayh. I have partnered with Senator Bayh on this issue for the past 3 years. We first introduced intellectual property enforcement legislation in the first session o the 109th Congress. I believe</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For over 4 years, I have been talking about the need for our Government to improve its efforts to protect our Nation's intellectual property from what I have referred to as the Pirates of the 21st Century. At a time when American businesses face some of the fiercest competition ever, our Government cannot ignore the growing threat of intellectual property theft to companies, workers, and consumers. Intellectual property theft is no longer an issue limited to knockoff hand bags and pirated DVDs  and CDs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, almost every product made is subject to being counterfeited. The problem of intellectual property theft impacts businesses--big and small. Genuine products manufactured in the United States are competing with phony products, which are sold both here and abroad. At a time when so many American businesses and workers are in dire straits, our Nation can no longer turn a blind eye to this problem. The economic impact of intellectual property theft is overwhelming. According to the U.S. Chamber  of Commerce, intellectual property theft is costing American businesses an estimated $250 billion each year and has cost an estimated 750,000 jobs. The chamber estimates that if counterfeit auto parts sales were eliminated, the U.S. auto industry could hire up to 200,000 additional workers. In my home State of Ohio, 200,000 additional auto industry jobs would make a tremendous impact in reversing the loss of manufacturing jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The costs of intellectual property theft are not limited to lost jobs and revenues. There are significant health and safety ramifications. For example, during a hearing I held in July 2006, the general counsel from Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems LLC, Bendix, which is headquartered in Elyria, OH, testified that counterfeit air brakes used in tractor-trailers are so authentic looking that some of these counterfeit products are returned to Bendix via its warranty claims process. Bendix is so  concerned about the safety implications of this problem that it is spending $1 million annually on IP protection and enforcement activities--that is $1 million that this one company is not able to spend each year on other things such as research and development</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The passage of the PRO-IP Act is an important step to building upon the efforts that have begun under the National Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordination Council and STOP! initiative. The PRO-IP Act will provide increased resources for Department of Justice programs to combat intellectual property theft and provide coordination and strategic planning of Federal efforts against counterfeiting and piracy. I am particularly pleased that the PRO-IP Act will create a White House-led coordinator.  I believe that the most effective intellectual property enforcement coordination requires White House leadership. As a result, I believe the efforts underway in each Department and agency will have improved effectiveness by placing the new IP enforcement coordinator within the Executive Office of the President. The coordinator will have both the visibility and the access to provide a most effective executive branch voice on IP enforcement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, while I am pleased that the Senate completed its work on passing intellectual property enforcement legislation, I know that my job is not finished. I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that Congress provides effective oversight over the various agencies and departments charged with enforcing and protecting intellectual property rights and that these entities have the resources necessary to get the job done.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are a nation in the midst of an unprecedented financial crisis. It is not just our financial enterprises that are shaken but our confidence in our own economic strength. The Members of this Congress and the people of this Nation are being asked to take extraordinary steps to contain the explosions on Wall Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must not, as we try to repair the structure of our financial institutions, neglect the very sources of our economic power. Intellectual property--copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets--is an ever-growing sector of our economy.

If we want to continue to lead the world in producing intellectual property, we need to protect Americans' rights in that property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is among the most important I have championed. I drew on the experiences of thousands of intellectual property owners, hundreds of law enforcement officials, and all the legislators on both sides of the aisle in Congress, and we have a bill that provides a focused and honed set of improvements to the intellectual property law, targeted increases in resources for significant enforcement efforts, streamlined interagency efforts to coordinate governmental intellectual property policies  but also vigorous oversight of the Justice Department's programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank all those who cosponsored it. Our bill is going to improve the enforcement of our Nation's intellectual property laws, they will bolster our intellectual property-based economy, and it will protect American jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are a Nation in the midst of an unprecedented financial crisis. It is not just our financial enterprises that are shaken, but our confidence in our own economic strength. The Members of this Congress, and the people of this Nation, are being asked to take extraordinary steps to contain the explosions on Wall Street. We must not, as we try to repair the structure of our financial institutions, neglect the very sources of our economic power. Intellectual property--copyrights,  patents, trademarks, and trade secrets--is an ever-growing sector of our economy. We are the envy of the world for the quality, and the quantity, of our innovative and creative goods and services. If we want to continue to lead the world in producing intellectual property, we need to protect our citizens' rights in that property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Long ago, I was the Chittenden County State's Attorney in Vermont. There is crime everywhere, even in Vermont, and I prosecuted every kind of case. I will never forget how much successful prosecutions depend on whether the investigators and lawyers charged with protecting the public from crime have the right tools to do so. No matter how dedicated the prosecutor, and no matter how outrageous the crime, if the laws are not clearly and sensibly drafted, or if the resources are simply inadequate,  no justice will be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The intellectual property enforcement bill we consider today is designed solely and specifically to ensure that law enforcement has the tools it needs to protect our Nation's impressive array of intellectual property. The revisions to the civil and criminal statutes, the provision of directed resources to Government at all levels, the coordination across the Federal Government of efforts in creating policies and enforcement efforts, and the requirements for reporting to the Congress--all of these  provisions are focused on strengthening the protection of our intellectual property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vermont is special to me, and the goods from Vermont that embody intellectual property are prized by consumers around the world. But every State in the Union is home to industries based on intellectual property. The creative and innovative Vermonters that I am proud to call friends and constituents have counterparts in every other State. These individuals and industries are essential to restoring and building our fiscal health. In a time of such frightening economic malaise, we should redouble  our efforts to make sure that the productive and valuable sectors of our economy are freed from the debilitating effects of theft and misappropriation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Intellectual property is just as vulnerable as it is valuable. The Internet has brought great and positive change to all our lives, but it is also an unparalleled tool for piracy. The increasing inter-connectedness of the globe, and the efficiencies of sharing information quickly and accurately between continents, has made foreign piracy and counterfeiting operations profitable in numerous countries. Americans suffer when their intellectual property is stolen, they suffer when those counterfeit  goods displace sales of the legitimate products, and they suffer when counterfeit products actually harm them, as is sometimes the case with fake pharmaceuticals and faulty electrical products.</paragraph>

I thank all the cosponsors of this legislation for their efforts and support. Our bill will improve the enforcement of our Nation's intellectual property laws, bolster our intellectual property-based economy, and protect American jobs.</paragraph>
