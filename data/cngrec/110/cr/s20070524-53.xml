    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to Joan McKinney--journalist, advocate for the free press and accomplished shag dancer--who turned 60 this week, for her outstanding contributions to the State of Louisiana and to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joan McKinney, originally of Greenville, SC, came to Washington in 1971 to work on the press staff of former Senator Fritz Hollings. As her career advanced, she chose to return to journalism, and she worked for papers in both Louisiana and South Carolina before coming back to work here at the Capitol, covering Washington for the Baton Rouge Advocate, a position she held from 1979 to 2003. I came to know and respect Joan in my many hallway meetings with her since I came to the Senate in 1997.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In her tenure as the advocate's congressional correspondent, Joan beat the Capitol's marble floors and came to be well respected by the Louisiana delegation. The Members from my State knew there was nothing, nothing that could get by her. She was so skilled at asking the right questions that she was able to draw from our elected officials  some truly famous zingers--such as when former Senator Breaux in 1981, while still a House Member, told her why he  was voting for a particular plan President Reagan was putting forth. He said his vote could not be bought, but it was up for rent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joan's work as a reporter stayed true to the best tenets of journalism. She served the people of Louisiana for a quarter of a century by informing them about the personalities and policies of their elected representatives in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through her work, Joan became an expert on the intricacies of the Senate and the Supreme Court. She has taken this knowledge with her into her current role as a member of the Senate Daily Press Gallery staff. Her Senate acumen on the institution and its procedure is of great value to the reporters roaming the gallery, cubs and veterans alike, who rely on her for deep insight about the Chamber they cover.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joan, who has won reporting awards from the South Carolina and Louisiana press associations, is a longtime member of the 112-year-old, elite Gridiron Club of newspaper writers. She was one of the first women to become a member. Her storied career as a journalist, which earned her the respect of fellow members of the press and politicians alike, should be an example to all aspiring women journalists. And for those lucky enough to gain a spot in the valued turf of the Senate Daily Press Gallery,  I know Joan will offer them a helping hand. The smart one will take it, and draw on the knowledge, experience and good heart, which has distinguished Joan among all who know her and the many more who have benefited from her years of believing in and serving the best ideals of our democracy.</paragraph>
