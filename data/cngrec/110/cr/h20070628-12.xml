  <speaking speaker="400432" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, less than 6 months ago, House Democrats promised not to hold recorded votes open to change the results. They went even further. They changed the House rules to prohibit this practice. But last night the Chair held a 2-minute vote open so that five Democrat Members could have their arms twisted, change their votes and pass the Udall amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what was this amendment? Democrats broke their promise for a provision that prohibits America from producing energy from our plentiful supply of shale, further demonstrating what a fraud the Democrats' energy policy is, a policy repeatedly preventing us from developing our own petroleum reserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shame on the Democratic leadership for going back on their promise with such breathtaking speed. More importantly, shame on the Democrats for a policy that stops Americans from producing our own energy, for causing gasoline prices to continue to rise, and for making sure we are increasingly dependent on foreign oil.</paragraph>
