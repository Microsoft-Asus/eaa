    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 349 and ask for its immediate consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:</narrative>
  <chair> The gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui) is recognized for 1 hour.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400663" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on <bill type="hr" number="349">H. Res. 349</bill> and insert extraneous materials into the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400663" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this rule permits the House to consider the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2007. This important legislation will be considered under an open rule with a preprinting requirement, allowing any Member to submit changes or improvements to the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Gordon, Chairman Baird, Ranking Member Hall, Ranking Member Ehlers, and the Science and Technology Committee have put together an excellent product, and I look forward to an open and constructive debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that today's debate will shine a light on the National Science Foundation. The National Science Foundation is truly one of the Federal Government's greatest accomplishments. It features a rich tradition that has supported talented young investigators, made America the world leader in basic science and innovation, and laid the groundwork for the Nation's economic strength.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This reauthorization also represents another important step in the implementation of the innovation agenda. By boosting scientific research and development, moving the Nation toward a clean energy economy, promoting broadband deployment, and supporting small business entrepreneurs, the innovation agenda will keep our promise to maintain and strengthen America's competitiveness and leadership in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At present the National Science Foundation supports research and education activities at over 2,000 universities colleges, K-12 schools, and research institutions throughout the country. It is unique among our Federal research enterprises in that NSF supports scientists and engineers across all disciplines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a given year, NSF will support about 200,000 scientists, engineers, teachers, and students. That is why NSF has led to groundbreaking research in such varied fields as genetics, computer science, information technology, nanotechnology, and climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By way of example, in my district, NSF funds the UC Davis Center for Biophotonics Science &amp; Technology. The center features dynamic and innovative research that harnesses light to facilitate revolutionary advances in biomedical science. The potential applications for medical research and treatment are groundbreaking and will offer hope to thousands of our constituents. That is the kind of research NSF supports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to point out that NSF resources are distributed on a competitive peer review basis; so an objective process allows for only the most worthy proposal to receive funding. This is the best kind of investment the Federal Government can make because the return on this investment is tremendous. By stimulating innovative research, we create educational opportunities for promising students and drive cutting-edge research throughout the country. There is no better way to fuel the economy  and create quality jobs. That is why the National Science Foundation has broad and bipartisan support in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This reauthorization provides $21 billion at NSF for fiscal years 2008 through 2010. In doing so, it keeps us on the path to double the National Science Foundation funding by 2017. This was a key recommendation of the highly respected National Academy's report on U.S. competitiveness, "Rising Above the Gathering Storm." And this boost is urgently needed, since today NSF can only fund about a quarter of the grant proposals that are submitted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also creates a pilot program targeted at new investigators so we can bring more talented young people into scientific research fields, and it directs NSF to facilitate public-private partnerships, a proven method to leveraging Federal investment and bolstering American competitiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this reauthorization bill is on the Agency's legacy of promoting math and science education by including the provisions of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Math and Science Scholarship Act, which the House passed last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I thank the Science Committee once again for this excellent legislation. I look forward to a robust debate on this bill, and I hope we can work with the Senate to get it on the President's desk in short order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. HASTINGS of Washington asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the National Science Foundation plays an important role in making sure that our Nation is a global leader in the fields of science and engineering. This Federal agency provides critical support for researchers, educators, and students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Specifically, Federal support allows American  scientists to pursue high-risk, high-return fields that increase our Nation's  competitiveness and scientific knowledge, and it ensures we are able to attract the brightest minds to our colleges and universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One area in which the National Science Foundation is supporting U.S. leadership in the sciences is in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory Program, or "LIGO" for short. The LIGO program, which operates an observatory in Central Washington in my district, is trying to detect for the first time the existence of gravitational waves, which have been sought by physicists around the world since they were theorized by Albert Einstein. Their discovery would lead to a greater understanding  of the makeup of the universe and would help solidify our Nation's lead in the field of physics and astrophysics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's fiscal year 2008 budget provides for the expansion of LIGO and nearly doubles funding available for the LIGO Hanford Observatory to allow for more advanced research. I am pleased that the National Science Foundation Authorization Act supports this proposed expansion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The LIGO program is not only an important investment in our Nation's science capability, but it also has been an instrument of learning for local communities. The LIGO's Hanford Observatory was recently awarded one of the first ever Science Education Advocate Awards by the Washington State Leadership and Assistance for Science Education Reform, a partnership of public schools and science institutions. LIGO is an excellent example of the National Science Foundation's dedication to funding world-class  research while also helping to grow students' interest in the sciences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if America is to continue to lead the world in science and the pursuit of knowledge, funding for the National Science Foundation is essential. The underlying legislation authorizes the National Science Foundation for 3 years at strong levels needed to maintain and strengthen research through the foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, Mr. Speaker, I am once again disappointed that the Democrat majority has once again missed an opportunity to provide consideration for the National Science Foundation Act under an open rule that would allow all Members of the House to come to the floor and offer an amendment during consideration of the bill. The National Science Foundation was last authorized in 2002, and at that time, the Republican majority allowed the bill to be considered under a truly open rule. I am disappointed that  the Democrat majority has pledged a new era of openness but so far has not lived up to their commitment. Instead, it frankly has tried to change the definition of what an open rule is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400663" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am very much looking forward to the upcoming debate on the National Science Foundation reauthorizing that this rule allows. In discussing the various programs and initiatives at NSF, we will demonstrate how the Federal Government can strategically and effectively drive scientific discovery and innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The importance of the National Science Foundation and its mission must not be underestimated. While America has been blessed with abundant natural resources and defensible borders, it is the innovative spirit of our citizens that has driven this Nation's leadership in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout our history, we have been willing to experiment, to take risks, to constantly redefine what is possible. That tradition has given us a competitive advantage over other countries that has created prosperity for the Nation, improving the quality of life for all our constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Members know well, our leadership in the global economy is at risk today. While we face rising threats from countries like India and China, we have also failed to make the necessary investments in education, science, and research and development to maintain the foundation of knowledge that has served us so well in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This NSF reauthorization takes great strides to remedy that neglect. Most importantly, by committing to double NSF funding over the next 10 years, we demonstrate that ensuring the Nation's competitiveness is of the highest priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the House continues to consider items from the innovation agenda, the importance we place on competitiveness will be demonstrated again and again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I look forward to today's debate and continuing to move forward on measures like this one that will bolster innovation and competitiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge a "yes" vote on the previous question and on the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The previous question was ordered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution was agreed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</paragraph>
