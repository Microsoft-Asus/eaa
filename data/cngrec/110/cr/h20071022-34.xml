  <speaking speaker="400257" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate the Wichita State University women's bowling team for winning the 2007 United States Bowling Congressional Intercollegiate Bowling National Championship. On April 21, 2007, the Wichita State University women's bowling team won the 2007 USBC Bowling National Championship Tournament by defeating Central Florida University in Wichita, Kansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to congratulate head coach Gordon Vadakin, women's coach Mark Lewis, assistant women's coach Kristal Scott, athletic director Jim Schaus, Wichita State University president Donald L. Beggs and the student athletes on an excellent season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After bowling eight events, the women's team played 362 games and knocked down 68,227 pins for an average score of 188.5 points. This was the eighth Intercollegiate Bowling National Championship for the Wichita State University women's bowling team and a record 31st appearance at the national tournament. The Shockers also had two juniors, Elysia Current and Emily Maier, named as First Team All-Americans, with Emily Maier being named to the All-Tournament team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Winning the 2007 USBC Bowling National Championship Tournament and winning their eighth national title has revealed its excellent athletic program at Wichita State University to the Nation. I know the fans, students, and alumni of the university will remember this moment for many years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, once again I congratulate Wichita State University for their success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 472, congratulating and commending the Wichita State University's bowling team for winning the 2007 United States Bowling Congress Intercollegiate Bowling National Championship. On April 21, 2007, the Wichita State University Shockers, as they are called, women's bowling team defeated McKendree College two games to none to claim their eighth national championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In game one, both teams went head-to-head in a low-scoring match. However, the Shockers were able to capitalize on a McKendree split and pull out a win 138-128. Close match. In the second match, the Shockers completely outplayed McKendree as senior Felicia Wong and junior Emily Maier doubled in the third and fourth frame and again in the eighth and the ninth to close out the match and claim the title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year's title is the team's first since 2005 and the eighth overall, which is the most in all of college bowling history. This title also adds to the amazing legacy of Wichita State bowling, as it is the 15th in school history, eight women's titles, seven men's titles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded in 1895, Wichita State University offers more than 60 undergraduate degree programs in more than 200 areas of study in six undergraduate colleges. The graduate school offers an extensive program, including 44 master's degrees in more than 100 areas and a specialist in education degree. It offers doctoral degrees in applied mathematics and chemistry, communicative disorders and sciences, psychology, educational administration and aerospace, and electrical, industrial and mechanical engineering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together with the City of Wichita, Wichita State University has built one of the most unique partnerships in Kansas, one that over the years has propelled each to new heights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my congratulations to head coach Gordon Vadakin, women's coach Mark Lewis, assistant women's coach Kristal Scott and President Donald Beggs, all of the hard-working players, certainly the fans and to Wichita State University. I am happy to join my colleague, Representative Todd Tiahrt, in honoring an exceptional team in all its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success. I ask my colleagues certainly to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400257" topic="">
    <paragraph>Does my colleague from New York have any more speakers?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400642" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes, Madam Speaker, I have one, and if it would be appropriate, I yield 5 minutes at this time to my colleague Mr. Tiahrt from Kansas.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400405" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York. I am pleased today to have the privilege of honoring the 2007 National Championship Wichita State University women's bowling team. House Resolution 472 congratulates and commends the Wichita State University's bowling team for winning the 2007 United States Bowling Congress Intercollegiate Bowling National Championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though known for its baseball and lately its basketball teams, the Shockers have had a long tradition of championship bowlers, and last year's team again made the region proud. The Wichita State University's women's bowling team has won eight intercollegiate bowling national championships, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1986, 1990, 1994, 2005, and now 2007, and has advanced to the national tournament a record 31 times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 21, 2007, the Wichita State University's women's bowling team won the 2007 United States Bowling Congress Intercollegiate Bowling National Championship Tournament in Wichita by defeating Central Florida University four games to one in the semi-finals and McKendree College of Illinois two games to zero in the finals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wichita State University earned the second seed on the day after completing 32 baker games. On day two, the team defeated Ohio State University four games to one in the best of seven series, Purdue University four to one and Newman University four games to two to advance to the semi-finals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the final day of the tournament, the Wichita State University women defeated Central Florida University four games to one in the semi-finals and McKendree College two games to zero in the finals to win the national championship at home at Northrock Lanes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite having a top caliber team, the championship was not assured going into the season because the Shockers had lost seven players from their top-ranked team from the 2006 season. The 2007 additions included six new members and three international players, Wichita local freshman Ricki Williams and two transfers. None of the bowlers had been in a championship game before nor a televised game. Yet they did not let the hype overpower them and instead let their talent shine through.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to congratulate WSU President Don Beggs and athletic director Jim Schaus for their leadership by creating a great university and an excellent athletic program. Wichita State is blessed to have two coaches, Gordon Vadakin and Mark Lewis, who are themselves members of USBC Hall of Fame. Head coach Gordon Vadakin has coached the team since 1978, leading it to the Intercollegiate Bowling National Championship Tournament 29 times and has coached the team to six national titles. Women's coach  Mark Lewis and assistant women's coach Kristal Scott directly coached the 2007 WSU women's team to the national championship in Wichita, Kansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2007 national championship team is comprised of the following members: Daniela Alvarado, Ashley Cox, Elysia Current, Sandra Gongora, Melissa Hurst, Samantha Linder, Emily Maier, Rocio Restrepo, Ricki Williams and Felicia Wong. WSU juniors, Elysia Current and Emily Maier, were named the First Team All-Americans, and Maier was named as the member of the All-Tournament team of the Intercollegiate Bowling Championship Tournament. I also want to thank Amy Skeen of my staff who worked on this resolution  and getting it to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I am very pleased that today the United States House of Representatives will congratulate and commend the Wichita State University's women's bowling team for winning the 2007 Intercollegiate Bowling National Championship Tournament. Go Shox.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400257" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 472. Team athletic competition teaches student athletes teamwork, cooperation, and leadership. These skills will translate into the classroom for each student as well as into their professional lives. I urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on <bill type="hr" number="472">H. Res. 472</bill>, celebrating the success of the Wichita State University Shockers.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. McCarthy) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, <bill type="hr" number="472">H. Res. 472</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to.</chair>
