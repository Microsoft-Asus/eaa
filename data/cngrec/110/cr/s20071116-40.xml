    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Joe Freeman of Mistletoe Meadows Christmas Tree Farm in Laurel Springs, NC, for winning the National Christmas Tree Association's 2007 National Christmas Tree Contest. As the Grand Champion, Mr. Freeman has the distinguished honor of providing this year's Official White House Christmas Tree. This storied tradition began in 1966, and I applaud Mr. Freeman for producing North Carolina's tenth Official White House Christmas Tree. After winning  at the State level, the Mr. Freeman's prized 18 1/2  foot Fraser fir was selected at the national competition. The prized tree was chosen to be the Blue Room Christmas Tree by White House Chief Usher Stephen Rochon, Superintendent of Grounds Irv Williams, Grounds Foreman</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year's Official White House Christmas Tree is a fine example of the exceptional quality of Christmas trees that we have in North Carolina. According to the North Carolina Department of Agriculture, in 2006 North Carolina led the nation in Christmas tree production, providing roughly one out of every four Christmas trees in the United States, and contributing over $134 million to North Carolina's economy. But this success did not come easily; it takes several years of meticulous care and  attention to raise a Christmas tree. An average 7 foot tree is about 10 years old, and throughout that time the grower diligently shapes, grooms, and fertilizes the tree several times per year. Not many people realize the years of hard work and sacrifice that go into raising a Christmas tree, and our growers are to be commended for their continuous success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>North Carolina celebrates a rich history of Christmas Trees, and year after year, many American families enjoy the warmth and beauty of these North Carolina trees that are a symbol of the holiday season. I am proud of the hard work exhibited by our Christmas tree growers in North Carolina, and I am proud that there will be another North Carolina Christmas tree in the White House this year.</paragraph>
