    <paragraph>Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute on the occasion of his retirement to Dr. Michael David Freed of Children's Hospital Boston for his service to the hospital and the thousands of children and young adults from Massachusetts and beyond who have benefited from his care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Freed has had a long and distinguished career at the hospital and Harvard Medical School, beginning in 1970, when he arrived to complete his fellowship training. At Children's Hospital, he rose to become senior associate in cardiology in 1976 and chief of the Division of Inpatient Cardiology in 1996.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Freed is a physician's physician. His commitment to providing the best possible care for children with heart disease is unwavering. He has used his breadth and depth of knowledge, his clarity of thought, his empathy, and his sense of humor to train more than 200 pediatric cardiology fellows and innumerable pediatric residents in the fundamentals of congenital heart disease. As a member of the Sub-board of Pediatric Cardiology, he ensured the highest quality of care by setting standards for  board certification for young pediatric cardiologists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At Children's Hospital, Dr. Freed has chaired or served on more than two dozen committees, projects, and task forces, ranging from quality improvement and patient care to graduate medical education and governance. His contributions extend well beyond Boston. He has served on the executive committees of all three major national organizations in his field--the American Heart Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American College of Cardiology, where he currently serves on the  board of trustees. He is also a member of editorial boards in the field of cardiology, and regularly has been included on lists of "top physicians" ranging from the book "Best Doctors in America" to Good Housekeeping and Boston Magazine. He is consulted by other pediatric cardiologists from around the world who seek his opinion on the care of their patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Freed has also written extensively in the field of pediatric cardiology and cardiac surgery and is particularly recognized for his work in the newborn physiology of congenital heart disease, infective endocarditis, and valvular heart disease. He has authored more than 60 original articles, contributed more than 40 reviews, chapters, and editorials, and developed more than 25 clinical communications and instructive CD ROMs. His leadership in establishing clinical practice guidelines for early  postoperative management of children in Boston undergoing open-heart surgery was a model for the development of such guidelines nationally. In addition, he has been a member of national working groups to develop guidelines on optimal care of individuals with heart disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Dr. Freed for his outstanding career and his achievements in improving the quality of care for children and young people with congenital heart disease in Boston and throughout the world, and I wish him well in retirement.</paragraph>
