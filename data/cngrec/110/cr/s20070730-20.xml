  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam. President, today I rise in support of the Unemployment Insurance Modernization Act which was introduced on July 25. I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators Edward M. Kennedy, Olympia J. Snowe, John D. Rockefeller IV, and Maria Cantwell to introduce this bipartisan proposal which seeks to encourage States to modernize their unemployment insurance systems. The Unemployment Insurance Modernization Act would make $7 billion in incentive payments  available to States to encourage them to expand eligibility for benefits and provide training to workers struggling with long-term unemployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The unemployment insurance, UI, program must be reformed to address fundamental shifts in the economy. The UI system provides needed benefits to millions of U.S. workers each year. But the system needs to be updated to better assist today's more highly mobile workforce and long-term unemployed workers left behind by declining industries. Today, many unemployed workers do not qualify for benefits because their most recent work is not taken into account. Others exhaust their benefits before finding  work, joining 1.1 million long-term unemployed workers and an additional 1.5 million discouraged job-seekers struggling to get by. For these reasons, only 35 percent of unemployed workers currently collect unemployment benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The UI Modernization Act sets aside $7 billion from tax receipts authorized under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, FUTA, to provide incentive payments to encourage States to update their UI systems. The bill rewards states for: (1) removing barriers that block coverage for low-wage and part-time workers; (2) ensuring a more family-friendly UI system; and (3) helping dislocated workers increase their skills. It also provides $500 million in funding to States to improve the administration of their  unemployment compensation systems. These administrative payments are fully paid for from the existing UI trust fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The UI Modernization Act would give States the resources and flexibility they need to pass important reforms. Each State would have a chance to receive a share of the $7 billion set aside for incentive payments. To receive one-third of its allotted funds, a State must adopt an "alternative base period" allowing workers to meet eligibility requirements by counting their most recent wages. This makes the system--which has traditionally relied on wage data that is up to 6 months old more accurate  and helps workers who have recently satisfied earnings requirements to collect the benefits they deserve. States that have already adopted such a system would also receive these incentive payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>States will receive the additional two-thirds of their share of funds if they adopt or have adopted two of the following reforms that benefit workers: (1) provide unemployment compensation for workers who have voluntarily left their jobs due to the illness or disability of an immediate family member, the relocation of a spouse for employment, or domestic violence; (2) provide training benefits to unemployed workers laid off from a "declining" occupation who are enrolled in a State-approved  training program for entry into a high-demand occupation; (3) provide unemployment compensation benefits to individuals seeking part-time work; (4) raise maximum compensation caps so that all long-term unemployed workers can receive a full 26 weeks of benefits; or (5) pay unemployed workers at least an extra $15 per week for each of the worker's dependents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in periods of unemployment, workers need a sound program of training and benefits to find new and rewarding opportunities. This bill will provide important resources to States like Virginia, as they improve their programs to help workers and their families in times of need.</paragraph>
