  <narrative>THE AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10946]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to commend Chairman Barney Frank, the House leadership, and the administration for working together to bring relief to the automobile industry and millions of workers. By passing the Auto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act, <bill type="h" number="7321">H.R. 7321</bill>, we took the monumental step of both saving jobs and setting the U.S. automotive industry on a path that will make it globally effective, efficient, and competitive. And equally important, we established a  new standard of accountability that must be enforced for any institutions seeking government assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For months, the Federal Government has been blindly throwing money at nearly every financial institution that blinks with no written requirements on how that money is to be used and with no written standards of transparency or accountability. In response, these institutions have taken hundreds of billion of taxpayer dollars and continued to do business as usual: the business of partying at the spa, getting their facials and manicures, getting millions in retention payments and spending hundreds  of millions of dollars on sports sponsorships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This type of mismanagement of taxpayer funds has left the American people suffering from bailout fatigue. I get that. I have been one of the most vocal critics of this distribution of top funds to date.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, today's legislation is completely different. The automakers have been forced to leap over 5 million hurdles to even be considered to receive a loan. And with every demand we have made of them, these companies have willingly obliged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot have one standard for white collar employees and a different standard for blue collar employees. We need to have strict standards for every one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation passed today includes very important oversight provisions to protect taxpayer dollars, such as prohibiting golden parachutes and capping executive bonuses. It also establishes a "car czar" position to hold these companies accountable for developing and implementing viable long-term restructuring plans and ensuring compliance on financing efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yet despite these requirements, there are some who will still believe that assisting the Big Three is a continuation of throwing good money after bad. I strongly disagree. With one in ten American jobs tied to the auto industry, this should not be considered a waste of money. We're talking about 3 million jobs expecting to be lost within a year if the auto industry goes down. With men and women across America continuing to struggle to keep roofs over their heads, to make ends meet, we simply  cannot afford to lose these jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released a report showing the loss of 533,000 jobs in November, the highest single month loss in 34 years, and one of the most dismal reports in the Bureau's 124-year existence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These figures were simply staggering, and we can and we must do better. And by passing this legislation today, we are taking a first step in doing so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For this reason, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to quickly consider <bill type="h" number="7321">H.R. 7321</bill> and enact this much-needed legislation as soon as possible. I ask them, and I hope they will have more faith in our automobile industry, and I encourage all of my colleagues to continue the strict standards of accountability as we move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield back.</paragraph>
