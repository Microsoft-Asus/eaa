  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 6, and as the designee of the majority leader, I call up the bill (<bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>) to provide for the implementation of the recommendations of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, and ask for its immediate consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The Clerk read the title of the bill.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="TITLE XIV--9/11 COMMISSION INTERNATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="TITLE XIV--9/11 COMMISSION INTERNATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we are here today considering this bill for one reason: To protect America from terrorism and from those who advocate hate and violence against our Nation and its values.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's be clear. The bill before us today does not contain Democratic or Republican ideas on how to protect our Nation. It contains American ideas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it contains ideas formulated by the 9/11 Commission, a bipartisan group of Americans chosen for their wisdom, expertise and love of country; Americans who we tasked to tell us what happened on September 11,  2001, and how to avoid it happening again. That is why we are here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues will put rhetoric and political games aside to do right by the American people, to do right by those whose lives were affected by 9/11, including those whose memories we honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard and read a lot of excuses about fulfilling the recommendations, Madam Speaker. On one hand, many of my colleagues across the aisle have publicly said for months they already fulfilled the recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past week they have accused the Democratic leadership of presenting a bill that doesn't fulfill the recommendation and leaves gaps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am a bit baffled. Did the Republicans fulfill or not fulfill the recommendations? I think we all know the answer, and that is why we are here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To those who want to point out alleged gaps in the 9/11 bill, I say, we can do better than the past. Here is a chance for Congress to stop dragging its feet, to become the "do something" Congress. We can stand around complaining and pointing fingers, or we can finally do the job we are here and hired to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is an old Irish proverb that says, "You will never plow the field if you only turn it over in your mind."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has spent 5 years turning over the 9/11 recommendations in its mind. On the topics covered by this legislation, we have seen bills introduced, amendments offered, hearings held, and investigative reports written.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Don't be fooled by those who say that this bill is moving too quickly. It has been 5 years since 9/11. It has been 3 years since the 9/11 Commission issued its report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now is the time, Mr. Speaker, to plow the field. Now is the time to act on the 9/11 recommendations. The 9/11 Commission has told us that we must provide Homeland Security grants to States and cities based on risk, not a pork barrel formula. This bill meets that recommendation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commission told us many more people could die after a terrorist attack or natural disaster if police, fire fighters and paramedics can't communicate with each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we will create a dedicated grant program to ensure State and local first responders have communication systems that talk to one another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 commissioners told us that more than 5 years after the hijacked planes flew into our national landmarks, our aviation system is still not secure enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We still do not spend our money cost-effectively to screen checked baggage. Airport checkpoints are not equipped with the most modern technologies, like those needed to detect liquid explosives, and cargo that is stored under a passengers seat is still not adequately inspected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill extends funding for advanced baggage screening and creates a novel new trust fund to strengthen checkpoint security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps more importantly, Mr. Speaker, this bill requires TSA to create a system of inspections to ensure that 100 percent of the cargo shipped on passenger planes is screened within 3 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TSA will do this through a system that uses equipment, technology, canines, inspectors and other means to ensure that the level of security provided for air cargo is equivalent to the level of security for checked baggage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also requires all cargo containers carried on ships to be scanned and sealed before they leave for an American port. The scanning requirement in this bill are put in place within a reasonable time frame, 3 years for large ports and 5 years for smaller ports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill takes other key steps to fulfill the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, such as strengthening critical infrastructure security and improving private sector preparedness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps more importantly, this bill will create a strong independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Board. It will also strengthen the authority of privacy officers in Federal agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that securing our Nation will be of little use if we lose our way of life. Our commitment to privacy and individual freedom is in this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long, Mr. Speaker, many in this House have talked about strengthening Homeland Security. But they are unwilling to pay the necessary price or confront the waste and White House mismanagement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now is the time, Mr. Speaker, to put action into words. Supporting the 9/11 Commission Fulfillment Act today will do just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> is to provide for the implementation of the recommendations of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (also known as the 9/11 Commission) produced an independent and comprehensive report evaluating the events and implications of the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. Included in the report were 41 recommendations on how to prevent such an attack from occurring again. As of the conclusion of the 109th Congress, not all of those recommendations had been fulfilled. Consequently, the United States remains unprepared  for a major emergency of that kind. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita's destruction of the Gulf Coast region further emphasized American vulnerability to national disasters, whether they are caused by nature or terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the report, several members of the 9/11 Commission participated in the "9/11 Public Discourse Project," which issued a series of report cards evaluating and ultimately grading the federal government's progress on executing the Commission's recommendations as they related to national security and preparedness. The final report card, issued on December 5, 2005, gave an alarming number of failing or nearly failing grades to key aspects of the government's policies, procedures, and  operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Areas that received failing grades included interoperable communications for first responders, risk-based homeland security funding, and airline passenger screening, all of which are addressed by <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>. Nearly-failing grades (D's) were used to describe the government's progress toward realistic assessment of critical infrastructure, checked bag and cargo screening for passenger aircraft, providing incentives for information sharing, encouraging government-wide information sharing, creating a  meaningful Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, a maximum effort to prevent terrorist from acquiring weapons of mass destruction, cultivating international scholarship and exchange programs with Arab and predominantly Muslim countries, and thoughtful examination of the role played by Saudi Arabia in the international community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By enacting provisions that address key recommendations from the 9/11 Commission, <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> will make the United States more secure, closing many of the security and preparedness gaps mentioned above that keep Americans vulnerable to future national emergencies.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The purpose of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, the "Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007," is to strengthen national security and emergency preparedness efforts by enacting recommendations made by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (also known as the 9/11 Commission) in their comprehensive report on the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there was no formal analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, it is estimated that with respect to Titles I through XI--those titles that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security--the only sections that would affect net direct spending are sections 402 and 403.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 402, which would extend provisions related to the Aviation Security Capital Fund through 2011, would have no net cost over time. That provision would receive credit for triggering collection of the first $250 million in passenger fees, which would offset the cost of subsequent spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 403, which creates a new $250 million checkpoint screening improvement fund for fiscal year 2008 that is funded through the Aviation Security Capital Fund, would have no net overall cost, although it would mean that the amount available to offset TSA's 2008 appropriation for aviation security would be reduced by $250 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pursuant to clause 3(d)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Constitutional authority for this legislation is provided in Article I, section 8, clause 1 of the Constitution, which grants Congress the power to provide for the common Defense of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section-by-Section Analysis of the Legislation</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;101--First Responders Homeland Security Funding. This section amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002, by inserting Title XX ("Funding for First Responders") to the end of the Act, including the following new sections:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;2002--Faster and Smarter Funding for First Responders. This section sets forth provisions governing Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grant funding for first responders pursuant to the State Homeland Security Grant Program, the Urban Area Security Initiative, and the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program. It specifically excludes non-DHS programs, the FIRE Grant programs, and the Emergency Management Performance Grant program and Urban Search and Rescue Grants program authorized  by specified Federal laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;2003--Covered Grant Eligibility and Criteria. This section specifies that high threat urban areas are eligible to apply for funding under the Urban Area Security Initiative and that States, regions, and directly eligible tribes may apply for funding under the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program. It also directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to require any State applying for a covered grant to submit a State Preparedness report,  to be developed in consultation with local governments and first responders. Additionally, this section precludes a grant award to a State absent approval of such plan. It sets forth minimum contents for grant applications, including the designation of regional and tribal liaisons (if the applicant is a region or directly eligible tribe) and requires regional and tribal</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;2004--Risk-Based Evaluation and Prioritization. This section requires the Secretary to evaluate and annually prioritize pending applications for covered grants based upon the degree to which they would lessen the threat to, vulnerability of, and consequences for persons (including transient commuters and tourists) and critical infrastructure. It also requires such evaluation and prioritization to be coordinated with the National Advisory Council (established as part of the recent FEMA Reform  Bill), the FEMA Administrator, the United States Fire Administrator, the Chief Intelligence Officer of the Department, the Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection, and other Department officials as determined by the Secretary. This section also sets</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;2005--Use of Funds and Accountability Requirements. This section lists authorized uses of covered grants and prohibits the use of grant funds to supplant State or local funds, to construct physical facilities, to acquire land, or for any State or local government cost sharing contribution. It authorizes covered grant applicants to petition the Secretary for reimbursement of the costs of any activity relating to prevention of, preparedness for, response to, or recovery from acts of terrorism  that is a federal duty and normally performed by a federal agency, and that is being performed by a State and/or local government under agreement with a federal agency. In addition, it sets the federal share of the costs of activities carried out under covered grants at 100 percent of the total for the two-year period following enactment of this Act and at 75</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;201--Improve Communications for Emergency Response Grant Program. This section would amend Title V of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 by creating a stand-alone interoperability grant program at the Department of Homeland Security. This provision requires the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Grants and Training to coordinate with the Director of Emergency Communications to establish the Improved Communications for Emergency Response (ICER) grant program to improve emergency  communications among state, regional, national, and in some instances, along the international border communities. The provision provides that the ICER grant would be established the first fiscal year following the Department's completion of and delivery to Congress of the National Emergency Communication Plan (as outlined in current law) and baseline operability and interoperability assessment,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;301--National Exercise Program Design. This section strengthens federal assistance to state, local, and tribal governments both in implementing and in fully understanding the National Incident Management System (NIMS), the Incident Command System (ICS), any relevant mutual aid agreements, and the broad concepts of a unified command system. It refines and focuses some of the provisions of the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 by expressly requiring that the National Exercise  Program include practical exercises that reinforce the aforementioned subject matters. Finally, it ensures that the utility of any exercise is maximized by requiring that the exercise plans of state, local, and tribal governments include the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;302--National Exercise Program Model Exercises. This section amends the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 to make it easier for state, local, and tribal governments to conduct exercises meant to reinforce NIMS/ICS training. It does so by requiring the Department of Homeland Security to develop and make available to them pre-scripted, preplanned exercise scenarios and materials that will need minimal tailoring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;303--Responsibilities of Regional Administrators of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. This Section amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 to require FEMA's Regional Administrators to assist state, local, and tribal governments in pre-identifying and evaluating sites where a multijurisdictional unified command system can be quickly established in the event of a terrorist attack or a natural disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;401--Installation of In-Line Baggage Screening Equipment. This provision directs the Department of Homeland Security to issue, within thirty days of final passage of the Act, a cost-sharing study required under the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 that will provide creative financing solutions to promote greater deployment of in-line explosive detection systems. Additionally, the Secretary is to provide analysis of the study, including a list of provisions DHS supports  and a schedule to implement them. The 9/11 Public Discourse Project gave Congress and the Administration a "D" on improving the security of checked baggage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;402--Aviation Security Capital Fund. The 9/11 Discourse Project gave "checked bag and cargo screening a `D,' stating that "Improvements here have not been made a priority by the Congress or the administration. Progress on implementation of in-line screening has been slow. The main impediment is inadequate funding." This provision renews expiring authorization for TSA to issue letters of intent, grants or other funding vehicles to airports to help support in-line EDS projects through  Fiscal Year 2011. Without this provision, authorization to issue such grants  would expire at the end of Fiscal Year 2007. The provision also removes the $125 million cap on the level of support that TSA can give airports under this fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;403--Airport Checkpoint Screening Explosive Detection. This provision creates a Checkpoint Screening Security Fund to support the research, development and deployment of EDS checkpoint technologies. The provision provides a one-time deposit of $250 million in FY 2008, from the revenues collected from the passenger ticket fees. The 9/11 Commissioners continues to be concerned about the threat that a would-be terrorist would get passed the TSA checkpoint with explosives strapped to their  bodies. The 9/11 Public Discourse Project gave Congress a "C" on improving airline screening checkpoints to detect explosives. The Commissioners found that "while more advanced screening technology is being developed, Congress needs to provide the funding for, and TSA needs to move as expeditiously as possible with the appropriate installation of explosive detection trace portals at more of the nation's airports."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;404--Strengthening Explosive Detection at Airport Screening Checkpoints. This provision directs the Department of Homeland Security to issue, within seven days of enactment, a strategic plan for the deployment of explosive detection equipment at checkpoints that is long overdue under the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;405--Extending Authorization of Aviation Security Funding. This provision reauthorizes the Aviation Security Capital Fund, which expires in 2007, through 2011 to ensure that TSA can continue to collect fees on tickets purchased by the flying public to enhance aviation security. This language would make available an additional $1 billion towards the challenge of expanding in-line EDS deployment, that is $250 million per year from FY 2008 through 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;406--Inspection of Cargo Carried Aboard Passenger Aircraft. This provision directs the Department of Homeland Security to establish and implement a system to inspect 100% of cargo carried on passenger aircraft by 2009. The measure directs the Department to develop a phased-in approach so that by the end of fiscal year 2007, 35% of cargo carried on passenger aircraft is inspected; by the end of fiscal year 2008, 65% percent of cargo is inspected; and by the end of fiscal year 2009, 100%  of cargo is inspected. Last December, the 9/11 Commissioners gave a "D" grade to Congress and the Administration for their efforts to enhance air cargo screening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;407--Appeal and Redress Process for Passengers Wrongly Delayed or Prohibited from Boarding a Flight. This provision directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to create the Office of Appeals and Redress to establish and administer a timely and fair process for airline passengers who believe they have been delayed or prohibited from boarding a flight because they have been misidentified against the "No Fly" or "Selectee" watch-lists. The 9/11 Commissioners identified problems with airline  passenger pre-screening as an area that needs addressing. In the 9/11 Public Discourse Project, the Commissioners stated that there has not been any real progress on improving the watch-listing process. The Department of Homeland Security was given an "F" in this area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;408--Transportation Security Administration Personnel Management. This section provides for equal treatment for all Transportation Security Administration employees, including screeners. This provision requires the Department of Homeland Security apply the same management system to all TSA employees, including screeners. Under this provision, all TSA employees, including screeners, would have collective bargaining rights and whistleblower rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;409--Advanced Airline Passenger Prescreening. This provision directs the Secretary to submit a plan with milestones to test and implement a system to prescreen passengers against the automatic selectee and no fly lists. The plan is due 90 days after enactment of the Act and must include (1) a description of the system; (2) a projected timeline for each phase of testing and implementation of the system; (3) an explanation of how the system integrates with the prescreening system for passenger  on international flights; and (4) a description of how the system complies with the Privacy Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;1501--Requirements Relating to Entry of Containers into the United States. This section amends 46 U.S.C. &amp;#167;70116 to add a new subsection. Under the new subsection, all containers must be scanned overseas using the best-available technology, including scanning for radiation and density, before they are loaded onto a ship destined for the United States. The scans will be reviewed by American security personnel before the container is loaded, and as technology becomes available, containers  will be sealed with a device that will sound an alarm when it is tampered with, and will notify U.S. officials of a breach before the container enters the Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States. This section also requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish standards for scanning</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this section, the Department of Homeland Security is required to issue a final rule implementing this requirement within one year after the Department issues the report on the foreign pilot program required by &amp;#167;231 of the SAFE Ports Act. In addition, this section mandates a phased-in application. The new requirement shall apply to containers loaded at larger ports (more than 75,000 TEUs loaded in 2005) beginning on the end of the 3-year period beginning on the date of the enactment  of this act. The new requirement shall apply to all other containers beginning on the end of the 5-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this act. This section encourages the Secretaries of Homeland Security and State to promote and establish international standards for the security of containers moving through the international</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Subtitle A--Human smuggling and trafficking center improvements </paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;601--Strengthening the Capabilities of the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center. This section would improve the capabilities of the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center (HSTC) by authorizing the Assistant Secretary of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to provide administrative and operational support to stem human smuggling, human trafficking, and terrorism travel. This provision would authorize the hiring of 30 FTEs, of which no less than 15 detailed special agents and intelligence  analysts--with at least three years of experience in the field of human smuggling and trafficking--would serve for at least two years at HSTC. This provision requires the Secretary to develop a plan whereby the responsibilities of the participating agencies and departments would be clearly defined, outline how the Department's resources would be used to support the intelligence functions of HSTC, and describe the information sharing mechanism with the Office of Information and Analysis (I&amp;A), ICE, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Under this provision, the plan must also develop a reciprocal clearance status for participating</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Subtitle C--Entry and exit of foreign nationals into the United States </paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;621--Biometric Entry and Exit Verification. This section directs that the Secretary submit a plan, detailing the manner in which the US-VISIT program meets the goals of a comprehensive entry and exit screening system--including both biometric entry and exit--and how it will fulfill statutory obligations. As of October 2006, this plan was still under review in the Office of the Secretary, according to US-VISIT officials. Without such a plan, DHS cannot articulate how entry/exit concepts  fit together--including any interim nonbiometric solutions--and neither DHS nor Congress is in a good position to prioritize and allocate resources, including funds for any facility modifications that might be needed, for a US-VISIT exit capability, to plan for the program's future, or to consider trade-offs between traveler convenience and security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Subtitle A--Fusion and Law Enforcement Education and Teaming (FLEET) grant program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;701--Findings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;702--FLEET Grant Program. State, local, and tribal law enforcement participation in state and local fusion centers advances the cause of homeland security by involving officers in the intelligence process on a daily basis; helping officers build relationships across every level and discipline of government and the private sector; and ensuring that criminal intelligence and other information is shared with their home communities. Unfortunately, the many local and tribal police and sheriffs'  officers who serve suburban, rural, and tribal areas lack the resources to participate fully in fusion centers. This section accordingly establishes and authorizes funding for a program that will help them detail officers and intelligence analysts to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Subtitle B--Border Intelligence Fusion Center Program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;711--Findings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;712--Establishment of Border Intelligence Fusion Center Program. Law enforcement officers speak highly of fusion centers--entities that have been established at the State and regional levels in order to make sense of the millions of pieces of data available to them, state health authorities, local first responders, the private sector, and other homeland security players. One place where police and sheriffs' officers have identified a need for such intelligence "fusion" is at America's  borders. As the June 2, 2006, arrest of suspected terrorists in Toronto, Canada, and news that al Qaeda has considered crossing the Mexican border to infiltrate the country both vividly demonstrate, America needs a "border intelligence" capability. Having situational awareness of the goings-on at our points of entry and all places in between would help the Department of Homeland Security make best use of its resources by partnering more effectively with the state, local, and tribal law enforcement officers that are the "eyes and ears" at our borders. Although it is commonly accepted that officers armed with that information could be effective lookouts for terrorists, drug and human smugglers, and others</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Subtitle C--Homeland Security information sharing enhancement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;721--Short Title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;722--Homeland Security Advisory System. This section directs the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis to implement an advisory system to relay advisories and alerts to the public regarding threats to the homeland. This bill likewise prescribes the contents of those advisories and alerts, and it makes clear that the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis is not to use color designations as the exclusive means warning the public of potential threat conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;723--Homeland Security Information Sharing. This section directs the Secretary to integrate the various intelligence components of the Department (CBP, ICE, TSA, etc.) into a Departmental Information Sharing Environment (ISE) to be administered by the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis. To support the development of the ISE, this section:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(1) requires the Secretary to appoint "Knowledge Management Officers" for each intelligence component in order to promote a coordinated approach to gathering and disseminating homeland security information;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) establishes business processes for the review of information provided by State, local, tribal, and private sector sources and related feedback mechanisms; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(3) establishes a training program for Department employees so they can better understand what "homeland security information" is, how they can identify it as part of their day-to-day work, and how it is relevant to the Office of Intelligence and Analysis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This section also directs the Secretary, acting through the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis, to establish a comprehensive information technology network architecture that will connect all of the databases within the Department of Homeland Security to each other--promoting internal information-sharing within the Department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&amp;A) and among the Department's various intelligence components. This section requires the Secretary to submit an implementation  plan and progress report to Congress in order to monitor the development of the architecture and encourages its developers to adopt the functions, methods, policies, and network qualities recommended by the Markle Foundation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>&amp;#167;732--State. Local. and Regional Information Fusion Center Initiative. This section directs the Secretary to establish an initiative to partner I&amp;A with State, local, and regional information fusion centers. Such fusion centers analyze and disseminate potentially homeland security relevant information to appropriate audiences in a given community and are managed by a State, local, or regional government entity. This section directs the Secretary to, among other things, coordinate the Department's  information sharing efforts with these entities; provide intelligence and other assistance to them; represent the interests of these entities to the wider Intelligence Community; and provide appropriate training. In addition, this section requires the Secretary to submit a concept of operations for the fusion center initiative before it can get underway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;733--Homeland Security Information Sharing Fellows Program. This section essentially creates a program by which State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies can nominate  officers to work alongside intelligence analysts in I&amp;A to accomplish three key goals for improving information sharing: (1) identifying for Department intelligence analysts what kinds of homeland security information are actually of interest to law enforcement, including information that can be used to help thwart terrorist attacks; (2) assisting intelligence analysts to write and disseminate intelligence reports in a shareable format--providing officers with specific and actionable information</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Subtitle E--Homeland Security intelligence offices reorganization </paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;741--Departmental Reorganization. This section reflects the changes wrought by the Secretary's Second Stage Review by redesignating the Directorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) within the Homeland Security Act of 2002 as I&amp;A. It likewise redesignates the "Under Secretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection" as the "Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis." This section also takes the list of responsibilities for the Under Secretary  for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection contained in Section 201 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and divides them up between the new Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis and the new Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection who heads the new Office of Infrastructure Protection (described in Section 763 below). This section also adds new responsibilities for the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis, including (1) coordinating and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;742--Intelligence Components of the Department of Homeland Security. This section defines "intelligence component"; requires the Secretary to provide training to intelligence component staff regarding the handling, analysis, dissemination, and collection of homeland security information; and sets forth the responsibilities of the heads of each of the Department's intelligence components. Those responsibilities include: (1) ensuring that the work of their component supports the Under Secretary  for Intelligence and Analysis and is consistent with his goals; (2) incorporating the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis's input with regard to performance appraisals, bonus or award recommendations, recruitment and selection of staff, reorganization of the component, and other matters; and (3) ensuring that staff has knowledge of and complies with the programs and policies established by the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;743--Office of Infrastructure Protection. This section establishes the aforementioned Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection to head the new Office of Infrastructure Protection. This section also lists six  key responsibilities for this new Assistant Secretary, including (1) conducting assessments of key resource and critical infrastructure vulnerabilities; (2) identifying priorities for Department protective and support measures; (3)  developing a comprehensive national plan for securing key resources and critical infrastructure; (4) recommending protective measures for key resources and critical infrastructure; and (5) coordinating with the Undersecretary for Intelligence and Analysis and the Department's homeland security partners.

    <paragraph>&amp;#167;803--Making: the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board Independent. This provision removes the Board from the Executive Office of the President and makes the Board an independent agency. Under its current structure, the Board acts under the direction of the President, its offices are housed within the White House and its members serve at the pleasure of the President. This section would grant the Board autonomy and change its status to an independent agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;804--Requiring: All Members of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to Be Confirmed by the Senate. This section requires every member of the Board to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The Board will be composed of a full-time chairman and 4 additional members. The Board members shall be determined to be qualified and selected on the basis of their professional qualifications, achievements, public stature and expertise in the areas of civil liberties and privacy. Moreover, there  shall never be more than three members of the Board that are members of the same political party and those individuals who are not of the same political party as the President can only be appointed after the President has consulted with the leadership</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;805--Subpoena Power for the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.

The subpoenas must be issued by the majority of the members of the Board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;806--Reporting: Requirements. This provision requires the Board to submit no less than two reports each year to the appropriate committees of Congress that shall include a description of the Board's activities, information on its findings, conclusions, minority views, and recommendations resulting from its advice and oversight functions. The Board will also receive and review reports from Privacy Officers and Civil Liberties Officers from other executive branch agencies. The reports shall  be unclassified, to the greatest extent possible, with a classified annex if necessary. The general public shall be kept abreast of the Board's activities through its reports, which shall be made public and through public hearings.</paragraph>

This provision will require the Secretary to provide the appropriate congressional committees with a summary vulnerability report and a classified annex for each industry sector. This provision also requires  the Department of Homeland Security to provide a summary report from the preceding two years to compare with the current report to show any changes in vulnerabilities, provide explanations and comments on greatest risks to critical infrastructure for each sector, and additional recommendations for mitigating these risks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;902--National Asset Database and the National At-Risk Database. This section requires the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to maintain two databases addressing critical infrastructure: the National Asset Database and, as a subset, the National at-risk Database. These databases will list the nation's critical infrastructure most at-risk of a terrorist attack. To develop the National Asset Database and the At-Risk Database, the Secretary will meet with a consortium of national  laboratories and experts. The Secretary is required to annually update both databases and remove assets and resources that are not verifiable or do not comply with the database requirements. The Secretary will also meet with the states and advise them as to the format for submitting assets for the lists and notifying</paragraph>

The new &amp;#167;7114(a) contains findings on the United Nation's 2003 Arab Human Development Report on the lack of quality public education, the high illiteracy, enrollment, and access rates in Arab countries. The new &amp;#167;7114(b) states the purpose is to strengthen  the public educational systems in Arab and predominantly Muslim countries by authorizing the establishment of an International Arab and Muslim Youth Opportunity Fund and providing resources for the Fund to help strengthen the public educational systems in Arab and predominantly Muslim countries. The new &amp;#167;7114(c) authorizes the establishment of an International Arab and Muslim Youth Opportunity Fund as either a separate fund in the U.S. Treasury or through an international organization or international financial institution; authorizes the Fund to support specific activities, including assistance to enhance modern educational programs; assistance for training and exchange programs for teachers, administrators, and students; assistance targeting primary and secondary</paragraph>

This section provides  findings regarding the pilot program established by &amp;#167;7113 of the 9/11 Implementation Act of 2004, stating that this program for outstanding students from lower-income and middle-income program in Arab and predominantly Muslim countries is being implemented. This provision also amends &amp;#167;7113 to extend that program for FY2007 and 2008, authorizes such sums as may be necessary for such years, and requires a report in April 2008 about the progress of the program.</paragraph>

This section contains findings describing the national security interests of the United States to promote democracy, the rule of law, good governance, sustainable development, a vigorous civil society, political freedom, protection of minorities, independent media, women's rights, private sector growth, and open economic systems in the countries  of the Middle East, Central Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. This provision also declares that it is the policy of the United States to promote in the short and long-term, democracy, the rule of law, good governance, sustainable development, a vigorous civil society, political freedom, protection of minorities, independent media, women's rights, private sector growth, and open economic systems in the countries of the Middle East, Central</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;1422--Middle East Foundation. This provision authorizes the Secretary of State to designate an appropriate private, non-profit United States organization as the Middle East Foundation and to provide funding to the Middle East Foundation through the Middle East Partnership Initiative. This subsection directs the Secretary of State to provide notification prior to designating an appropriate organization as the Middle East Foundation. It also requires the Middle East Foundation to award grants  to persons located in the Middle East or working with local partners based in the region to carry out projects that support the purposes specified in subsection (a); and permits the Foundation to make a grant to a Middle Eastern institution of higher education to create a center for public policy. In addition, this section prevents the funds provided to the Foundation from benefiting any officer or employee of the Foundation, except as salary or reasonable compensation for services, and provides that the Foundation may hold funds provided</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Subtitle C--Restoring United States moral leadership </paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;431--Advancing United States Interests through Public Diplomacy. This provision finds, via the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, that the U.S. government has initiated some promising initiatives in television and radio broadcasting to the Arab world, Iran, and Afghanistan and that these efforts are beginning to reach larger audiences. It also includes a sense of Congress that the United States needs to improve its communication of ideas and information to  people in countries with significant Muslim populations, that public diplomacy should reaffirm the United States commitment to democratic principles, and that a significant expansion of United States international broadcasting would provide a cost-effective means of improving communications with significant Muslim populations. In addition, this section amends the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 to include a provision establishing special authority</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;1432--Expansion of United States Scholarship. Exchange, and Library Programs in Arab and Predominantly Muslim Countries. This section directs the Secretary of State to prepare a report on the recommendations of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States for expanding U.S. scholarship, exchange, and library programs in Arab and predominantly Muslim countries, including a certification by the Secretary of State that such recommendations have been implemented or if  a certification cannot be made, what steps have been taken to implement such recommendations. This provision also directs the Comptroller General of the United States to review the certification once submitted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;1433--United States policy toward Detainees. This section restates the 9/11 Commission recommended that the United States develop a common coalition approach toward detention and humane treatment of captured terrorists, that while the U.S. has passed a number of laws in this area, it has not developed such a common coalition approach, and that a number of U.S. allies are conducting investigations related to treatment of detainees. It also requires a report 90 days after enactment of the  Act and 180 days thereafter on any progress on developing such an approach, and a certification that such an approach has been implemented or, if such certification has not been made, the steps taken to implement this recommendation. In addition, this provision terminates the requirement of subsection (b) if the Secretary makes such a certification, and requires a GAO review of the certification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Subtitle D--Strategy for the United States' relationship with Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia </paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;1441--Afghanistan. This provision declares that it is the policy of the United States to maintain its long-term commitment to Afghanistan by increased assistance and the continued deployment of United States troops in Afghanistan and that the President shall engage aggressively with the Government of Afghanistan and NATO to assess the success of the Afghan December 2006 counternarcotics strategy and to explore all additional options for addressing the narcotics crisis in Afghanistan, including  considering whether NATO forces should change their rules of engagement regarding counternarcotics operations. Moreover, this section declares that the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 should be reauthorized and updated, and directs</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;1442--Pakistan. This section declares that it is the policy of the United States to work with the Government of Pakistan to combat international terrorism, to end the use of Pakistan as a safe haven for forces associated with the Taliban, to establish a long-term strategic partnership with Pakistan, to dramatically increase funding for programs of the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Department of State, and to work with the international community to secure additional  financial and political support to assist the Government of Pakistan in building a moderate, democratic state. This provision also requires the President to submit a report on the long-term strategy of the United States to engage with the Government of Pakistan to address curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons technology, combating poverty and corruption, building effective government institutions, promoting democracy and the rule of law, addressing the continued presence of the Taliban and other violent extremist forces throughout the country, and effectively dealing with Islamic extremism. In addition, this section prohibits the provision of United States security assistance to Pakistan until the President certifies that the Government of Pakistan is making all possible efforts to prevent the Taliban from operating in</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&amp;#167;1443--Saudi Arabia. This provision states Congressional findings that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's record in the fight against terrorism has been uneven and that the United States has a national security interest in working with the Government of Saudi Arabia to combat international terrorists, and expresses a sense of congress that the Government of Saudi Arabia must undertake a number of political and economic reforms in order to more effectively combat terrorism. This section also provides  for a number of statements of policies regarding the U.S. relationship to Saudi Arabia, including engaging Saudi Arabia to openly confront the issue of terrorism, to enhance counterterrorism cooperation, and to support reform efforts by the Government of Saudi Arabia.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400219" topic="TITLE XIV: 9/11 COMMISSION INTERNATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at the outset, let me thank the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), the new chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, for the work that he did, certainly in the  time that I was chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and he was the ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also wish him the very best as he embarks on his tenure as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. And even though we certainly will have differences today and the debate will be strong at times, I want to assure him that I share the same commitment he does. I know that he shares the commitment that I have to work together in a bipartisan way on the issue of Homeland Security and throughout the next 2 years. I certainly look forward to working with him and cooperating with him in  every way that I can, and I know I speak for the members of the committee on my side of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is, to me, a very significant matter that Homeland Security is listed as the top issue. I agree that it should be. I agree that it is, and to that extent, I certainly commend the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) for bringing forth this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I am extremely disappointed in the way it is being done. And I say that not just as a matter of process or a matter of procedure, but I say that as a person who, during the 15 months that I was the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, I did all I could to ensure that every piece of legislation that came through our committee was bipartisan from day one. Every piece of legislation went through a complete subcommittee hearing. The Democratic minority, at the time, were fully apprised  of all that we were doing at all stages. Went to a full committee hearing, and again, everyone was apprised of all that was happening. It was an open book. And as a result of that, we passed very, very significant bipartisan legislation in the most recent Congress, the Port Security Act, chemical plant legislation, reforming and restructuring FEMA. The interoperability legislation, which was jointly sponsored and advanced by Mr. Reichert</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am disappointed today that such a piece of legislation, which attempts to deal with such a vital issue in such an all-encompassing way is going to be done without any benefit at all of going through the committee, having committee hearings, getting testimony, of reaching out. We, as Republicans, had no say whatsoever in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I emphasize, I can speak for the Homeland Security Committee. That never happened during the 15 months that I was the chairman, nor do I believe it ever happened under my predecessor, Mr. Cox.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as far as the legislation today, as I said, parts of it are disappointing. And I guess this even goes back to last week. If there is one issue, one recommendation that the Homeland Security Committee made was that we should centralize as much jurisdiction as possible in one committee, rather than have such a multiplicity of committees and subcommittees in both Houses requiring the Secretary and the assistants and the undersecretaries to come up to the Hill to be testifying, and also to get  a much more coordinated policy. Nothing was done on that whatsoever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the chairman pointed out that perhaps Republicans could have done this in the past. Well, the fact is, this is a work in progress. It was the Republican majority which set up and established, first as a select committee for 2 years and then as a permanent committee since January of 2005, the Committee on Homeland Security. I know in my conversations with the leadership, it was certainly the intention to centralize it more. Would they have? I believe they would have. If not, I certainly would  have fought to have it done because one thing I think the former ranking member and the current chairman and I would agree on, we saw last year what happened when you had legislation going from one committee to the other, one committee trying to grab a small part of it and slowing down the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, we found out how nuanced and how complicated these issues are, and that very few of us ended up where we began. We saw, as the debate went forward, as the hearings went forward, as the expert witnesses came in, just how intricate these issues were and how vital they were and how important it was not to jump ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the chairman mentioned, for instance, scanning 100 percent of cargo within 3 years or most of it done within 3 years. Now, on its face, that sounds very good. It is a good sound bite. It is good for a 100-hour scenario. But the fact is, we held extensive hearings on that. The fact is that the legislation that was arrived at between the House and the Senate, seeing the complexity of it, and realizing that there is no technology in place right now that could bring that about, has set up pilot  projects around the world, and we will get a report back on those projects with a sense of urgency and a need to implement whatever can be implemented. But to set forth a 100-percent standard when there is no evidence now that that can be achieved during that time period, to me, gives a false hope to the American people, and it is playing, to me, it is trivializing what should be the most important issue that confronts the Nation today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, also, on that and to show that our constructive criticism of this issue is not done in a partisan way, the Washington Post today had an editorial extremely critical of that provision in particular and the process in general.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with that I look forward to the debate today. As I said, I have real problems with the process. I have certain specific problems with parts of the legislation. But that can be all brought out in the debate today. Unfortunately, there won't be an opportunity to offer amendments on it. As I said, there were no committee hearings. But it is going to be a long 2 years, long in the sense that we have a long period in which to get a lot done. But, on the other hand, I assure Mr. Thompson  that once we get this behind us, I look forward to working with him in as bipartisan a way as possible. And with the respect I have for him, I think, at the end of that long 2 years, the American people will see that we have achieved quite a bit.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Notwithstanding the remarks of the gentleman from New York (Mr. King), the fact is that the bipartisan 9/11 Commission gave the last Congress Fs and Ds in implementing its recommendations. This Congress is determined to earn its As in implementing those recommendations, and not just by inspecting the air and sea cargo but also by distributing the funds that are available based upon risk, not just by population; by preventing the spread of terrorism and, particularly, weapons of mass  destruction; by reducing the appeal of extremism through international quality education and the expansion of democracy and economic development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But most of all, Mr. Speaker, this Congress is determined to implement the principal recommendation of the 9/11 Commission, which was to restore U.S. moral leadership. That is the intent of this bill. I strongly urge support for it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during the Presidential debates of 2004, there was one point of consensus between the two candidates that is important for us in our debate today. In answer to the question of what is the single most threat to the national security of the United States, both candidates agree that nuclear proliferation and weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorists was the biggest threat. This view was shared by the 9/11 Commission, which recommended a vital effort to prevent and counter  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> will help put the United States much further down the path to addressing the problem of weapons of mass destruction, proliferation, and terrorism. It will strengthen the Cooperative Threat Reduction program also, known as the Nunn-Lugar program, as well as the Department of Energy's nonproliferation programs. It will strengthen and expand the multinational Proliferation Security Initiative started by this administration and will establish a new Coordinator for the Prevention of Weapons  of Mass Destruction, Proliferation, and Terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also establishes a new commission to follow up on the work of the 9/11 Commission focused on the issue of weapons of mass destruction, proliferation, and terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the bill will repeal a set of limitations on nonproliferation programs which threatens on an annual basis to shut off access to program funding unless Congress or the President waives them. It simplifies the authority to use those funds outside the countries of the former Soviet Union when necessary and appropriate while strengthening oversight. The bill authorizes such sums as are necessary for these programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the Proliferation Security Initiative, the bill calls upon the President to continue and to expand it. It directs the administration to develop and transmit to Congress a defined budget for this effort and initiates a GAO review. The bill further authorizes the President to use foreign assistance as an initiative to get more countries to join.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The coordinator for the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction, Proliferation, and Terrorism established by this bill will be a senior aide close to the President who can give the nonproliferation programs spread across the Federal Government the support they need and, of course, deserve. The bill requires a comprehensive strategy to fully use and coordinate these programs, and it calls for measurable goals and milestones by which we can judge progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The commission established by this bill will build upon the excellent work of the 9/11 Commission by examining in detail the existing nonproliferation programs and also any new and creative ideas for securing dangerous materials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the commission would follow up on the work of the Baker/Cutler Commission, which made a series of recommendations in this area in 2001.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding me the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is truly a shame that the new Democratic leadership has chosen to turn what was a bipartisan, carefully calibrated approach to safeguarding our Nation's security in the aftermath of 9/11 into a partisan political tool. This bill does have some good elements. In fact, a big portion of the foreign policy titles in the bill mirror what is already in law, with some minor additions or recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That said, the bill does raise concern, and it even includes drafting errors that could have been avoided had we on the other side of the aisle had in the committees been allowed to operate and been allowed to contribute to the drafting, but we were not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, the Nuclear Black Market section in this bill, Mr. Speaker, is a legislative effort that I had the pleasure of working on with the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) throughout the last few years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, much has changed. Parts of it need revision. It needs to be reedited and updated. But we will be unable to fix these provisions and make these necessary corrections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Far more troubling, Mr. Speaker, is the profound divergence between our two parties that this legislation reveals. The divergence is clearly most demonstrated in the provisions regarding the Proliferation Security Initiative, known as the PSI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its creation by this administration in the year 2002, the PSI has quickly become one of this country's most valuable tools in helping to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction and preventing them from falling into the hands of terrorists. Our PSI partners and others at times have stopped the transshipment of material and equipment bound for Iran's ballistic missiles programs and also prevented Iran from procuring funds and the goods to support its weapons of mass destruction programs,  including its nuclear program; and it was PSI cooperation between the U.S., the U.K., and other European partners that began the demise of the Dr. A.Q. Khan network, an action that was also instrumental in convincing the Libyan Government to stop its nuclear weapons and longer-range missile programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite this success, Mr. Speaker, this legislation urges the President to secure a resolution by the United Nations Security Council that would authorize the PSI under international law. We have seen how ineffective the U.N. Security Council has been in compelling Syria to stop its support for terrorist activities in Lebanon, or at least in keeping to its own deadlines regarding Iran's nuclear program. Giving the United Nations the ability to define what is permissible under the PSI will result  in the imposition of unpredictable limitations, unpredictable conditions, and unpredictable interpretations and would result in a regulatory straightjacket overseen by the international bureaucracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, Mr. Speaker, this is disturbing. I need only point out the continuing efforts by Russia and China to hobble the efforts of the United States at the United Nations to apply pressure to Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons program. If this recommendation were followed, the PSI would be undermined. The problem, however, is far deeper than merely the threat to this vital and proven program. The position of some of my colleagues across the aisle appears to be that the PSI and similar efforts  by the United States to defend its citizens against terrorists and other threats require authorization under international law by the United Nations. They believe that these so-called  multilateral regimes are credible substitutes for the efforts of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must oppose any efforts to substitute action by the U.N. and other international organizations for those of the U.S. Government in carrying out its fundamental responsibility to protect the American people and advance American interests. I know that there are many of my colleagues who are equally concerned that this proposal should be adopted. I know their constituents will be, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, I hope that all of our colleagues carefully think about some of these provisions and that they put partisan politics aside when it comes time to vote on the motion to recommit, a motion that reaffirms a central tenet of the U.S. foreign policy, and that is that it is the responsibility of the U.S. Government to protect the American people. This responsibility must never be surrendered to the United Nations or other multilateral institutions.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, colleagues, our country is living on borrowed time. A quantity of highly enriched uranium or plutonium the size of a grapefruit that could be put into a vehicle the size of a U-Haul truck could result in the detonation of a nuclear weapon about the size of that which leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Loose nuclear materials have been too loose and too free for too long around the world. This was the first and most urgent recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. Frankly, we have been moving at too slow of a pace with too little of a focus and without sufficient funding to get this problem under control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's long overdue legislation is a necessary first step toward protecting the American people against these egregious consequences. This legislation properly focuses on the problem of loose nuclear material, the origins of which and the whereabouts of which we do not know. It focuses upon nuclear material that is in hands that are not properly being secured, it focuses on nuclear materials that are being properly secured, and it expedites the process of converting reactors that use highly  enriched uranium to reactors that would use low-enriched uranium and, therefore, be much, much less of a risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the first time, there will be a central point in the executive branch where the diplomatic intelligence, research and development and military responsibilities for bringing this problem under control will be focused and centered in one place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The job will not be done by the passage of this legislation. But for too long we have lived on borrowed time waiting for the passage of this legislation. I would urge my colleagues on both the majority and minority side to vote "yes" and start us down the road toward solving this egregious and urgent problem.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to come to the floor during what I consider to be probably one of the most important issues that we will consider, not only in this 100 hours, but in this entire session of Congress, because this issue determines and will determine the very security, not just the security as far as a terrorist attack on this Nation, but even our economic security; and the actions that are taken here have great implications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I believe that my good friends on the other side of the aisle are very well intended in what they propose today, unfortunately I believe they are misguided in what they are doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a copy of the 9/11 Commission report. I chaired for some 6 years the Aviation Subcommittee. I inherited it by fate of the good Lord and circumstances here in Congress. I followed from the very beginning the creation of TSA and all of the actions that we have taken from day one in protecting this great Nation against a terrorist attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I have read the proposals that are brought forth here today. Unfortunately, these proposals can result in turning in the wrong direction at this time in our vulnerability against terrorist attack. Let me be very frank, and I offered before, and I am sorry that the other side did not accept it, unanimous consent requests that we resolve into a committee for 1 hour, 1 hour of a secret session to discuss the pending threats against this Nation and also the status of our security systems in place  to deal with those threats, and I was denied it. As part of the record of this Congress, now, I was denied that opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are 54 Members who were elected, new Members, Republican and Democrat, who have not had access to that classified information. They will vote in a few hours on turning the direction of the system that we have put in place and a system we are trying to make work to protect us against a terrorist attack, and we have been denied the opportunity for 1 hour in closed session, with no cameras, no public, but the classified reports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask that the titles of each of the classified reports that now are in possession of the Transportation Committee be included in this part of the RECORD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DHS OIG FINAL PENETRATION TEST RESULTS--March 30, 2004</paragraph>
    <paragraph>BRIEFING TO THE CHAIRMAN, AVIATION SUBCOMMITTEE--HOUSE COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE--March 31, 2004</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have tried to make this work, and the good Lord and some efforts on behalf of many people, maybe just sheer fate, have brought us to this day and not being attacked. And last week on Thursday when I gave up that responsibility of chairing Aviation, a great mantle came off my shoulders, but I am telling you that you are headed in the wrong direction today. We have a very fragile system of security, particularly aviation security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now you come forth with recommendations. One recommendation dealing with cargo security is not a recommendation in this 9/11 Report. I defy anyone to find it. So what you are doing is taking our limited resources that protect us and putting them in an area that does not protect us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had problems with TSA, yes. I have had four TSA administrators in 5 years. That is a problem with TSA. We have a system out there that screens passengers as they come through. And there are some improvements, I must say, that you have provided in this, but they are not the improvements we need. And now we are  telling TSA, an agency across the Potomac here in Washington to head in another direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have taken the money for research and development that was first authorized, we put it in the original TSA bill, $50 million, half of it was taken by a Senator for a pet project. The next year $75 million, this Congress failed to act, and $63 million was spent on salary instead of research and development for the technology to protect us. So here we go off in another direction on a recommendation I defy anyone to find in here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another point here, and it is nice to throw your friends a bone but this is not the time to do it. I am telling you, I am very serious about this, folks, and listen to this. These words will be repeated because this Nation is at risk, and you won't take 1 hour to even listen to what that risk is or address that risk and what you are going to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nowhere in this 9/11 Commission does it say that we should give collective bargaining rights to airport screeners, to TSA screener personnel. Nowhere. We had a bipartisanship agreement when we created TSA that we wouldn't do that and put us at risk, that we needed to move people around, that we needed to fire people when we needed to do that. This is taking big government; we have 43,000 screeners, 43,000 screeners, it is taking big government and it is doing the worst thing we could possibly  do is making it entrenched in big government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to replace those people with technology. Here is the report: 78 percent of the personnel could be replaced that now conduct checked baggage screening. You go to the airport, you check your bags. Check your bags. The failure rate of that system that was forced into place, I tried to get us to opt for technology; instead, we spent some $20 billion so far on this system that is reliant on people, human beings who fail. We could save 78 percent of the personnel costs. There are 16,800 people  checking those bags by hand. I visited some 50 airports during August and September, and I am telling you, the system is flawed. And you are changing now to a recommendation that isn't even in this report? You are taking a big bureaucracy and making it an entrenched bureaucracy? You are putting us at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This isn't a game, a political game where we score a few points and tell people we are doing something. This is about our women and children, our wives and mothers and our loved ones being put on aircraft and not having a secure system in place, and we aren't doing that with these proposals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So maybe I am a little bit too emotional on this subject, maybe I have been too involved in this subject; but I am telling you for the sake of this country and our security. And many of the Members here have not had the opportunity to sit down and look at those classified reports. When this report was written, liquid bombs, liquid explosives, does it appear anywhere in here? The terrorists that we deal with now, is it addressed anywhere here? I need to have these points in the Record  because this deals with our national security. And I am telling you, and mark my words on this day, that our terrorist-hatred folks know what is going on. They have tested the system, they test the system, and they scope the system and they see these flaws, and they would have to be laughing to see us change our resources to go in another direction and put us at risk today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, there are some good things in here. We have right now about a dozen airports with in-line high-tech systems. One of the them is the Speaker, Ms. Pelosi's, airport. It is the safest airport in the world. It has private screeners, and it has automated in-line high-tech equipment. Its capacity to find and detect threats is almost flawless. That is the model that we need; instead, we have about a dozen airports. Unfortunately, it will be 20 years at the current rate in which you propose  to protect us with even that basic protection.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee for yielding time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker I rise in strong support of the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007. Congress has reformed the intelligence community to better identify global threats and defend the United States, but for too long we have had a gaping hole in our security, eliminating the threat of weapons of mass destruction. And for too long the Bush administration and their congressional allies have left nonproliferation on the back burner. The bill before us today provides the tools we need to fight  the threat of the world's most dangerous weapons. In the last Congress, I introduced the 9/11 Commission Combating Proliferation Implementation Act along with my colleagues JOHN SPRATT and MARTY MEEHAN.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The essential provision of our bill contained also in the bill before us today creates a coordinator for the prevention of weapons of mass destruction proliferation within the White House. The coordinator would also have both the budget authority over all nonproliferation programs and would also be responsible for designing and implementing a strategic plan to address the current threat levels posed by weapons of mass destruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, nonproliferation efforts are overseen by the Departments of Energy, Defense, and State. While they all have had some success, these three large agencies are not guided by an overall plan or supported by a single individual who has the ability to ensure accountability. Because of the lack of high-level attention and leadership, some programs have either lapsed or been burdened with unrelated restrictions. Such a coordinating function has been recommended several times, including in  the 1999 Deutsche Commission, to access the organization of the Federal Government to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the 9/11 Commission warned: "The greatest danger of another catastrophic attack in the United States will materialize if the world's most dangerous terrorists acquire the world's most dangerous weapons."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know the threat; now we have to act. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues and Mr. and Mrs. America, this is primarily a political  gesture without a great deal of result, and that is unfortunate. The hearings are necessary, especially in cargo screening. It has been shown to us that the cargo screening port security cannot occur within our ports themselves without total cooperation from the overseas shippers to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are asking in this bill is expenditure of huge dollars for really window dressing and not results. As the gentleman from Florida said, we are not really in this legislation as being proposed giving us any more security. We are expending dollars in the billions in the airports, and it will be in the billions in the ports and the waterways of our Nation. And the direct result will be, and keep this in mind, Mr. and Mrs. America, a direct cost to you without any security. Every product,  everything you pick up that is imported to the United States will add an additional cost, and it may make us noncompetitive. There are other ports within our hemisphere that will be accepting without the security that is being offered in this bill within our ports the cargo that should be coming through our ports employing our people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you want true security, it will be done at the origin of shipping to the United States, and that is where we should be putting our efforts, not a charade of saying we are going to have our ports secure because we are going to put millions of dollars, billions, into the screening of everyone who works in the ports and setting up an artificial barricade of security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is an old saying: If you want a secure area, don't let anybody know how you secured it. What this proposal says is: national standards shall be set, and thus you shall be secure. But if I am the bad guy, I will figure around it to do good damage, bad damage to you, good damage to me. I ask you to reconsider and let's go back to the hearing process and do this job right.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee for yielding time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of fully implementing the September 11 Commission recommendations. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I can say that this bill creates a new foundation of security here at home by protecting our borders, our infrastructure and our freedoms. This legislation also plays an equally important role by reenergizing our engagement abroad and creating a new foundation for security in the international arena. These provisions, particularly those dealing with the  prevention of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, are what I would like to discuss today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will not be safe here at home as long as the worst weapons can fall into the worst hands. Citizens around the world will not be safe unless responsible nations work together to locate, secure and destroy global nuclear stockpiles. Today we are rightfully strengthening the leadership of the United States in these important areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time for us to fully engage in the nonproliferation and counter proliferation arenas is long overdue. This bill dramatically strengthens the nonproliferation regime by both strengthening the best programs of the last decade and creating a new coordination and sanctions mechanism that will strengthen the nonproliferation mission for the future. I am particularly pleased with the provisions that will strengthen the Proliferation Security Initiative, or PSI, and the Cooperative Threat Reduction  Initiative, CTRI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the involvement of approximately 70 nations, PSI has become the primary platform that allows us to work with our allies to search planes and ships carrying suspect cargo and to seize illegal weapons or missile technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, until now, the future of this successful program was uncertain. Without a dedicated funding source and without integration into international law, this critical program could falter without proper administration support. This legislation works to secure the future of PSI by integrating it into both international law and to our own budget process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, finally, this bill provides Congress with the ability to fully support CTRI programs that are geared to lock up nuclear weapons and nuclear materials around the world. By lifting funding limitations and encouraging the program's expansion, this bill shows the world that our Nation, the United States, will strengthen its role as the global leader in combating proliferation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 6 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, time moves on, but before some of us begin pretending that we are legislating on a blank slate when it comes to 9/11, I am going to take this moment in my time to remind everyone of the good work that was indeed accomplished over the last 2 years. In fact, we are also standing on the shoulders of giants who, in the face of the tragic events of 9/11, actually took action to make this Nation a safer place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress's first responders were both Republicans and Democrats, and some of them were here just last session writing laws to protect America. America's firefighters, police officers, ambulance crews, the ones who received $1 billion, "B" as in big, to help save American lives surely haven't forgotten about Congress's efforts, and neither should we.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The issue of our Nation's own security is too important to play politics with. And while some on the other side perhaps would prefer to give the impression that Congress has done little, nothing could be further from the truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of what was accomplished and what we can do more. Indeed, we succeeded in enacting within the Energy and Commerce Committee's jurisdiction a number of provisions improving public safety communications. For example, the digital television provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act cleared 24 megahertz of spectrum in every market in the Nation exclusively for use by its first responders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The interoperable communications provisions provided in the Deficit Reduction Act did not merely authorize funding but made $1 billion in direct spending available for equipment to enable first responders to more effectively communicate with each other in times of disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Call Home Act accelerated to September 30 of this year the deadline for distribution of that $1 billion for interoperable communications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Warning, Alert and Response Network, WARN Act, created a framework through which wireless communication providers can transmit emergency alerts to the public on a national, regional or local basis and required that the Federal Communications Commission adopt technical standards for that alert system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The national alert provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act made $156 million in direct spending available for use with the national alert system created under the WARN Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The E911 provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act made another $43 million in direct spending available to implement the Enhance 911 Act of 2004, which provides grants to upgrade existing 911 systems for advanced capabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security appropriations legislation created an Office of Emergency Communications within the Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight. That office is directed to develop a national emergency communication plan and to report on the communications capabilities and needs of emergency response providers and relevant government officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are all critical items that we have already enacted into law over the last 2 years, better preparing our Nation to respond to natural or manmade disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From my own leadership spot as chairman of the Telecommunications and Internet Subcommittee, I seized on one particular recommendation offered by the 9/11 Commission. I wanted to help our first responders, and I am proud of the work that we did on a very strong bipartisan basis. First of all, we provided a slice of the spectrum for the first responders, 24 megahertz, and we saw that with Katrina as well, that our first responders in New York couldn't get the signal to evacuate the building. We  saw that our folks helping folks in Katrina couldn't communicate between  the Coast Guard helicopter and the sheriff boat down below. That is going to change because we are going to give some of the responders some of that spectrum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, we know that the cost for this equipment is enormously high. We provided $1 billion in the Upton amendment, which I helped shepherd through our committee and through the conference, to provide the means for our first responders so that they could purchase the equipment. It was done. The President signed it into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As much as we would like to say that this could be effective today, January 8, 2007, we cannot do that. First of all, we have to get the spectrum. That means we have to retrieve it from those that are using it, in this case, the broadcasters. They have to make the transition from analog to digital. A lot of them have done that, but it is more than $1 million often for some of these stations. We also have to think about the consumers, the millions of Americans who do not have a digital TV set.  They can't receive the signal unless they have got that converter box. They aren't made yet. We have a transition for that to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of the day, we set a date, a hard date, when that all would happen, February of 2009. There were many that took us on that didn't want a hard date. They wanted to extend forever and a day, perhaps. In fact, there were amendments offered to delay the date even further. I would like to say that, at least on our side of the aisle, we opposed every one of those amendments to extend the deadline, and thank goodness we were successful because that date is now set. We had to work and negotiate  with the Senate, with ourselves, but it is now set. It is a good thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have an unmistakable record of results. Let us work together and build on them.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Michigan outlined crucial actions we took in the last Congress to improve the use of telecommunications technologies, and I appreciate those efforts, especially as co-Chair of the E911 caucus. But our work for Homeland Security was not confined to the telecommunications arena.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most important issues Congress faced last year was creating a program in the Department of Homeland Security to protect chemical facilities from terrorist attacks. The challenge was to ensure that our Nation's chemical plants could appropriately secure their facilities by providing technical guidance and oversight by the Department of Homeland Security but without being overzealous and allowing DHS to take over the daily management of these facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We needed to prevent terrorists from using our domestic disclosure laws from obtaining roadmaps to our chemical plants' vulnerabilities. Congress also clarified the distinct reach of existing environmental and public health laws versus homeland security and chemical plant securities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the more conscientious members of the American chemical industry already had a head start on Congress by developing rigorous security standards on their own, Congress has now ensured that good security standards govern all significant chemical players, not just the conscientious leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DHS's chemical security program is not about using the threat of terrorism as an excuse to drive American chemical factories offshore. Its purpose is just the opposite: to make certain that chemical facilities continue to be safe for these workers and communities, to ensure the viability of employment in the chemical industry for American workers, and to guarantee that all Americans can continue to enjoy the benefits of these plant products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Chairman Barton said last year, America does not become safer with greater levels of regulation. It just becomes more regulated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DHS has recently proposed regulations to carry out this new chemical plant security authority, and those regulations closely follow Congress's intent in hammering out the compromise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with the Department to ensure that the program gets underway and measures up to the task that Congress gave it in the Fiscal Year 2007 Homeland Security Appropriations Act.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill, long past due, but a good bill in many respects, particularly in the application of this bill to the nonproliferation of nuclear materials and nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the debates, Presidential debates, between President Bush and Senator Kerry, there was one subject on which both candidates found common ground: They both agreed that the gravest threat to the United States is terrorists armed with nuclear weapons or crude radiological weapons. That may be the gravest threat facing us, but you wouldn't know it from the application of resources in the Defense budget today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commission, looking at what we have done, gave us a "D," a "D," on efforts to restrict access to weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons. There are tons of weapons-grade plutonium and enriched uranium scattered about the world. For example, under the Atoms for Peace program, enriched uranium was leased or lent to countries around the world to be used in their research programs. Much of that nuclear material, some of it fissile, is loosely secured, some by no more  than a chain link fence and a junkyard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Graham Allison, who was the dean at the Kennedy School at Harvard, wrote a book about this subject and entitled it "Preventable Catastrophe" as if to emphasize, on one hand, the dire threat and, on the other hand, the fact that we are not necessarily doomed to this fate. The first thing he recommended is, we have got to keep nuclear materials secure and away from the reach of terrorists and rogue states.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill assembles the best of various bills and amendments that we have debated in committee, sometimes on the floor and in conference, occasionally with success, more often than not for one reason because we haven't been able to get all of our members out of the Rules Committee. But here in a nutshell is what we would do: Set up a director for nonproliferation, we need somebody who can direct this effort, oversee it, seek the funding for it and fight for it; speed up the removal of nuclear  research materials or, where they can't be removed, enhance their security; expand the so-called Proliferation Security Initiative, by which the United States can seize nuclear materials on the high seas outside the United States and coordinate such interdiction with other countries; and expand the so-called Cooperative Threat Reduction program, better known as Nunn-Lugar. In cost-benefit terms, this may be the best money we have spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>To date, we have deactivated 6,000 warheads, 500 ICBMs, 400 ICBM silos.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the first responder  and emergency management reforms in this 9/11 bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the past chairman of the emergency management subcommittee, I am very familiar with first responder reforms we enacted since the September 11 attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there are some improvements in this bill, the major 9/11 reforms were made under Republican leadership. Since 9/11, we have provided over $15 billion to prepare State and local first responders. We increased funding for Fire Grants and created the SAFER grant program for hiring firefighters. We also created a billion dollar grant program for emergency communications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike the unfunded authorization in the Democrats' bill, Republican leadership provided real money. But we have done much more than simply throw money at first responders. We also enacted a comprehensive reform bill that rebuilds FEMA's capabilities and establishes a truly national preparedness system. We gave FEMA the authority and the tools they need to manage all disasters. We strengthened FEMA's regions, response teams, logistics, and communications capabilities. We established a national  preparedness goal and set clear preparedness standards for State and local governments to coordinate their resources and focus on their highest risk priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We established a national incident command system so that all levels of government can integrate their forces in a disaster. We created a comprehensive training and exercise program so first responders will be ready when the next big disaster strikes. And we created a comprehensive assessment and lessons-learned program so that first responders won't make the same mistakes again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike the bill before us, we made these reforms through a series of committee hearings and markups with bipartisan support. While the press releases are going to claim that this bill implements all of 9/11 Commission recommendations, the reality is that the vast majority of legislative changes were made under Republican leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is no more than window dressing. It is not good policy; it is politics.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill, <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If 9/11 taught us anything, it is that the leadership we most need in this Nation today is not a leadership to lead us out of a crisis, but rather a leadership that prevents such crises from ever happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today is about offering such leadership. As a Nation, we have been fortunate to have wars away from our shore, "over there." But after 9/11, we saw that we now face a war here at home. And 2 1/2  years ago a bipartisan commission provided 41 recommendations to prevent another attack on U.S. home soil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Few argue that the commission's recommendations are wrong. But so far their implementation generally rates Fs, Ds and incompletes. And so this legislation ensures that we will win at home by having a homeland defense that says to our adversaries, Today is not your day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the honor while serving in the military of leading our youth in harm's way overseas. But 5 days ago, I became responsible for a new set of citizens, the constituents of my district. When I think about how to serve them best, and to turn their hopes into accomplishment, our foremost duty is to provide for their security this time here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation needs the tools to be secure: training that can prevent a crisis and first responders with seamless communications among Federal, State, and local levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today as we debate, we are reminded of what John F. Kennedy once said: "The hour is late, but the agenda is long," which is why we must act now to implement these long overdue recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as we look at ourselves in the national mirror and say we are better than this, we can and we must change for a more secure America. We then can look our constituents in the eyes, Mr. Speaker, knowing that we did turn their hope into accomplishment here at home. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must confess, I do not understand the compulsion to integrate PSI into international law under the United Nations. I share my ranking member's concern with the fact that weakening the Proliferation Security Initiative is going to have grave consequences for the security of this country. And it is going to have grave consequences for the administration's ability to interdict weapons of mass destruction material. This needlessly empowers the United Nations to weaken our hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now the Proliferation Security Initiative is a Bush administration multilateral initiative aimed at stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, interdicting those weapons of mass destruction on cargo, whether on land or in the air or at sea. It has been around since 2003. It is an aggressive response crafted by then-Under Secretary of Arms Control John Bolton, and it checks increasingly sophisticated proliferators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the proliferation subcommittee I chaired in the last Congress heard in hearings, PSI has produced results. It has served as a strong deterrent to would-be proliferators, most recently conducting a joint exercise in the Persian Gulf where Iran menaces. PSI cooperation has stopped the transshipment of material and equipment bound for ballistic missile programs in countries of concern, including Iran. It has had a dozen successes, and it was critical in uncovering Libya's WMD program and the  A.Q. Khan proliferation network in 2003 in Pakistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The key to PSI is its flexibility. The key is the ability to cooperate with other countries on a moment's notice. That is something that an organization like the United Nations inherently cannot do. Yet this bill before us instructs the President to pursue a U.N. Security Council resolution to authorize the PSI under international law. Putting a successful multilateral program up to a Chinese veto strikes me as weakening PSI rather than strengthening it, as is called for by the 9/11 Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, then-Secretary Kofi Annan endorsed PSI as is, with no call for a Security Council resolution. By keeping PSI flexible, it avoids the lowest-common-denominator approach that U.N.-centered initiatives inevitably take. If the majority really wanted to bolster PSI, the other body should have kept its key champion, Ambassador Bolton, in place at the United Nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as for the legislation to authorize the President to establish an International Arab and Muslim Youth Opportunity Fund to be located as a separate fund in Treasury or through the international organization or financial organization, naming UNESCO or the U.N. Development Program as possibilities, why would we locate this fund in UNESCO or UNDP, which would surely distort its goals and mismanage its resources?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The UNDP in 2005, as Israel was withdrawing from the Gaza Strip, financed the Palestinian Authority's production of propaganda materials, banners, bumper stickers and T-shirts bearing the slogan: "Today Gaza, Tomorrow the West Bank and Jerusalem." This rightly led to protests from U.S. Representative John Bolton, who rightly called this funding inappropriate and unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then there is the UNDP's long record of hostility toward economic freedom. Has anyone thought through this fund? I do not think this fund was thought through, and I think a chance to go through the committee process would have allowed us the opportunity to raise these serious concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nor do I understand, frankly, the compulsion to give the United Nations this input and this ability to have the Security Council veto the authority we right now have in order to effectively use our Proliferation Security Initiative on the high seas.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have a solemn commitment to those who lost their lives in the 9/11 attacks, to the people who lived through those brutal events, and to all of their loved ones. Honoring this commitment will help spare others in our country from enduring similar pain and loss. It is the right and responsible thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to apply the lessons learned from September 11, 2001, including the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, until now we in the Congress have only partially met our responsibility to assure that these recommendations are fully implemented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today on this floor we are adopting the rest of those recommendations as we promised. As the 9/11 Commission recognized, the struggle between the forces of tolerance and pluralism and the forces of nihilism and destruction is not confined to a single dimension. It is a war of ideas as well as a war of arms. It is a challenge of diplomacy and development as well as one of intelligence and ideology. Our bill recognizes this fact in a number of ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It includes the commission's recommendation to establish an International Arab and Muslim Youth Opportunity Fund to help expand, improve, and modernize the public education system in the Muslim world, an idea whose time surely has come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation directs the Secretary of State to develop a 5-year country-by-country strategy of promoting democracy, the rule of law, sustainable development, private sector growth, and open economic systems. This provision will focus on building democratic institutions and not focus on elections alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are establishing a Middle East Foundation in order to facilitate the delivery of assistance to our friends in the region who are involved in civil society, to increase political participation and to foster independent media. We have sought to follow the commission's advice to restore the moral leadership of the United States by increasing our public diplomacy efforts, including the expansion of U.S. scholarship, exchange, and library programs in the Muslim world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the treatment of detainees in the war on terrorism has undermined our national security. It has eroded our moral standing in the world and made it more difficult for the intelligence services of our friends and allies to work closely with us. Our bill will provide additional review over what the administration has done to create a common coalition approach on all these matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our bill also addresses U.S. policy towards three countries whose role is critical in the war on terrorism: Afghanistan, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. It reaffirms our commitment to a stable and democratic Afghanistan so that no future terrorist acts may be launched from that country, it provides that the United States must work with Pakistan to end the use of its territory as a safe haven for Taliban and al Qaeda, and it provides us additional oversight tools over our relationship  with Saudi Arabia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation, Mr. Speaker, strengthens our efforts to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists. It addresses the emergence of a black market in nuclear technology that has facilitated the development of nuclear programs in Iran, North Korea, Libya and elsewhere. Our legislation provides for sanctions against individuals and corporations which deal in this illegal trade in nuclear materials and technology. It will help us determine which countries are allowing such black markets  to operate from their territories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation makes significant improvements in the effectiveness of U.S. nonproliferation programs. Our bill removes all impediments to securing and eliminating so-called "loose nukes" and the dangerous nuclear material that terrorists could use one day against us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a comprehensive package that has been supported by members of the 9/11 Commission. It is not the end of our work of protecting our Nation's security, requiring constant vigilance by this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage all of our colleagues to look around this Chamber as we conduct this debate. If not for the heroism of a dedicated handful of Americans, this building, this Chamber and this shining monument to democracy might well have been reduced to ashes on September 11, 2001. We have a commitment to ensure that the lessons of that day are a permanent part of their legacy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to compliment the Chairs, particularly my friend, the distinguished gentleman from California, for their hard work on this legislation. This bill was not easy in getting ready, given its size and scope, and the House owes all its thanks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is entirely proper that the first bill of this 110th Congress, <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, be focused on the implementation of the 9/11 Commission Report. Under the previous majority and under the leadership of the current administration, America's common defense has been shortsighted, irresponsible, poorly conceived and incompetently executed. There can scarcely be any argument that our Nation's reputation is in tatters; our finances are in disarray; our alliances are in poor repair; our deterrent posture has  been weakened; and our Armed Forces have been overextended and are nearing exhaustion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bush administration and the Republican Congress of the past have combined, through a posture of belligerence and torpor, arrogance and ineptitude, to make America less free, less strong and less safe. From the party that has claimed "peace through strength" as its guiding principle, we have unfortunately come to discover that "war with weakness" has been their governing practice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But a new day has dawned, and I am proud, Mr. Speaker, that we have turned our attention so readily in this new Congress to cleaning up the mess that has been made of our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that hindsight offers almost perfect vision. But the great and bitter irony, indeed the great tragedy of the past 2 years, is that, in contrast to the confused and inept policy the Bush administration has pursued and that the previous Congress rubber stamped, there was and there is a readily available, easily implemented strategy waiting on the shelf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From July 22, 2004, onward, a clear and compelling strategy for the struggle against the radical Islamic terrorists who attacked our Nation on September 11th has been waiting for us, shamefully gathering dust. It is a bipartisan strategy. It is a thoughtful and insightful strategy. And most significantly, it actually is a strategy. It is an actual and realistic plan for applying all the tools of national power  to achieve our national interests and protect  our Nation from further attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It does not depend on the metaphysical power of the word "freedom" to transform cultures or dissolve ancient hatreds. It does not assume that elections are great sociological Band-Aids that will make everything all better; and it is not faith-based. It is not a policy which we simply announce and then hope and pray that it works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a strategy that recognizes that our enemies are dangerous, but they are also vulnerable. It is a strategy that sees the difference between great nations with powerful industrial economies, and a league of violent religious zealots living in caves and on the margins of society. Our enemies are not all powerful, and it is about time that we stop trying to terrify the public in order to justify and excuse bad policy and infringements upon our civil rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to remember that whatever chaos, murder and destruction al Qaeda's leadership and the global jihadi movement have perpetrated, in truth they are not great leaders and theirs is not a great movement. They are dangerous, for sure, but they are also failures. Virtually every success the jihadist have celebrated since 9/11 have actually been the work of our own badly guided hands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What have they marked as signs of progress? Is the civil war in Iraq the result of their unstoppable juggernaut of chaos or our recklessness in tearing down the structures of law and order and our incomprehensible unwillingness to match forces to the mission? Is the collapse of security in Afghanistan the outcome of their mighty offensive or our unconscionable passivity and penny-pinching? Is the rise in violence in the Arab-Israeli conflict the product of their clever tactics or our idiotic  disengagement? And is the decline of our reputation and prestige a consequence of their brilliant public relations strategy or our fixed determination to treat Arab and Muslim public opinion as irrelevant?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth is that our enemies face enormous handicaps. Their goals and methods are broadly considered illegitimate, even in the countries we have most alienated. Our enemies can destroy, but they cannot create. They can impose, but they cannot inspire. Their vision of the future is, in fact, utterly unpalatable to the great mass of their own desired audience. Indeed, the grandiosity of their vision for a revived caliphate generally inspires mockery and scorn, not support or adherence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our enemies are a few thousand lunatics who want to put the entire world in a straitjacket of 12th century Islamic law who shouldn't be hard to defeat in a public relations war. If our situation wasn't so tragic and dire, it would be hysterically funny. If it were a movie, it would be "The Jihadi Mouse that Roared."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 5 years after 9/11, it is about time we put in place a strategy that takes the threat as seriously as it deserves but doesn't wrap our Nation around the twin axles of fear and ignorance. And just because our military is readily available and highly effective doesn't make it the right tool for every job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commission Report was explicit about the significance of the foreign policy components of an effective national counter terrorism strategy. Sadly, the Bush administration and previous Congress thought little of this advice. Public diplomacy was equated with campaign-style spin and flavor-of-the-month diplomatic initiatives designed to address American critics but not Arab or Muslim public opinion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill takes a different tact. Instead of broadcasting our inability to steer events, this legislation will strengthen our ability to create like-minded allies. Instead of alternately yelling at Arab governments and giving them cash anyway, this legislation sets in motion efforts to strengthen our allies at the roots of their societies. Instead of sweeping bad behavior by allies under the carpet, this bill demands that the administration come clean about what has been happening in the key  regions and what the United States has done in response.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is more that must be done to right our policy in the Arab and Muslim world, and as a member of the Middle East and South Asia Subcommittee, I am looking forward to getting to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission is an appropriate starting point and hopefully marks a welcome change of course. The fact that we have not been attacked since September 11th should give us no more solace than the 8 years of quiet between the first attack on the Twin Towers and the day that they were destroyed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We may only hope that our continuing efforts will hold the next attack in abeyance indefinitely. As the President likes to remind us, we are safer but not yet safe. Today's legislation implementing the 9/11 Commission Report is not a panacea, but it will make us safer still. I strongly encourage all Members of the House on both sides of the aisle to support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Florida for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when terrorism crashed through our national borders and claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 Americans, including over 50 men and women from my district in New Jersey who were in the World Trade buildings that day, I advocated early and consistently for a commission to chronicle the lessons learned from the 9/11 tragedy and to develop a well-informed, thoughtful strategy to reduce the risk of future terrorist attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The commission's report and subsequent legislation were thoroughly examined by House committees, including the two hearings that I chaired, one in the Committee on International Relations on visa reform and recommendations for enhanced U.S. diplomacy, and the other in the Committee on Veterans' Affairs on emergency medical preparedness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The scrutiny given to the report by previous Congresses was robust, thorough and fair, and although prior legislation implemented numerous important measures that have bolstered our national security, indeed, much has already been done, we must always be diligent in implementing new and expanded means for responding to developing threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&#xBF; 1430</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our enemies as we all know are constantly on the prowl searching for our vulnerabilities, and our ability to remain ahead of them is critical for our very survival.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us today is yet another attempt in trying to distribute the majority of homeland security and first responder grants based on the risk of terrorism. New Jersey is the most densely populated State in the Nation with at least a dozen sites placed on the FBI's national critical infrastructure list. I, along with members of our delegation in New Jersey, have maintained, like a majority of this House and like the Bush administration, that the Department of Homeland  Security's first responder grant system was flawed and needed to focus on critical infrastructure rather than on minimum guarantees and a simple population count. The risk formula established by this bill, which will face tough sledding over on the Senate side, will ensure that the Department of Homeland Security thoroughly and accurately evaluates the risks that New Jersey and other States and locales face rather than just doling it out like it's pork-barrel money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate title VI's provisions that recognize and address the often overlooked correlation between terrorism and human trafficking and smuggling. In addition, like many here in this room, I applauded the creation of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Board 2 years ago. Unfortunately, it has not been implemented in a way that matched the intent of the law nor in the way that the 9/11 Commission had recommended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> does include significant reforms that would strengthen the efforts of that board by making it an  independent agency and giving it subpoena power. These provisions will ensure that the government is protecting America's privacy while still doing everything in its power to protect our Nation from a terrorist attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> and strongly recommend its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have said many times, terrorists won't check our party registration before they blow us up. The American people know this. And they expect us to protect them in spite of many barriers--personal, institutional, and political--that often gridlock the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, keeping America secure is our sworn constitutional duty. This bill, which includes measures considered over the past 2 years by Chairman THOMPSON and the Homeland Security Committee, is important. If it becomes law, it will make us safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me highlight a few items.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, a strengthened Privacy and Civil Liberties Board. Originally created as part of the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, the Board is reestablished as an independent agency with subpoena powers and all five members are subject to Senate confirmation. That is a good thing, and something Speaker PELOSI urged as the Intel Reform bill was written.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, a greater allocation of Homeland Security grants based primarily on risk, rather than the "squeaky wheel" theory. My own District includes portions of LAX and the Port of Los Angeles. But other cities and States are also subject to significant risk--from obvious targets like New York and Washington, to smaller communities with nuclear or chemical facilities. Congress must direct its limited resources where threats are greatest, period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, intelligence and information-sharing. I believe reforms at the Federal level are beginning to take hold--though I wish the Intelligence Committees in Congress would get budgetary authority, as the 9/11 Commission recommended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> focuses on providing State and local first responders more of the intelligence tools they need. For example, it requires DHS to deploy officers to border State fusion centers, and permits State and local authorities to send detailees to DHS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is locals, after all, who will be most likely to know what's wrong in their neighborhoods. And so we must trust and empower them to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, interoperable communications. I salute our colleague Representative LOWEY for her persistence. Without interoperable communications, we won't have the ability to stop or respond to major attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> is aptly numbered. It is this House's first responsibility. Vote "aye."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for giving me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise and offer my support and brief comments on this measure before the House today, the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Implementation Act. This act reflects our determination to strengthen the United States' efforts to combat terror on these shores and as such is commendable and prescient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clearly in our national best interest to pass this productive legislation and fulfill yet another promise to the American people. Productivity and focus of this kind were clearly demanded by the American citizens in the 2006 national elections. The 9/11 Commission Recommendations Implementation Act is far reaching, and it encompasses a multitude of endeavors critical to ensuring our Nation's security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must pass this legislation, Mr. Speaker. This legislation is critical. This legislation is important. This legislation is what the American people have asked us to pass. One such endeavor that I particularly am pleased to see in this legislation is the strengthening of port security. In my district and in surrounding areas, we have the largest port complex, the Los Angeles and the Long Beach port security. This bill talks about, and we will put into place by phasing in the requirement for  100 percent screening of cargo containers bound for this United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before this 110th Congress, the Congress before us did not put this in any piece of legislation. This is important because if we are going to safeguard and bring national security to this country, we must look at the cargo that comes and passes through these ports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other thing, Mr. Speaker, is aviation security. This bill will require and direct the Department of Homeland Security to establish a system for inspecting 100 percent of cargo carried on our aircrafts. I heard earlier on the floor that we need high tech. This is what this bill is talking about, bringing about high technology that will screen the cargo that is carried aboard our aircraft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that we pass this piece of legislation because this legislation is important to ensuring that we have national security and a secure America. I call on Congress to pass this legislation today and to implement it as quickly as possible because of the importance of this piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other thing that we have here that requires our looking at and passing this bill is that the 9/11 Commission gave us a C grade on passenger screening at checkpoints to detect explosives. We must pass this legislation so that the American people will be safe.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Speaker Pelosi and our leadership for putting together an outstanding bill and thank Mr. Lantos and the leadership of our committee for the provisions within the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs committee. I expect to be the chair of the subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs Committee that deals with terrorism and nonproliferation, and I want to focus on those matters in my short presentation here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The most important issue facing the United States and certainly the most important part of this bill deals with preventing nuclear attack on American cities. Since a nuclear bomb is about the size of a person, it could be smuggled into the United States inside a bale of marijuana. Now, I know that this bill will deal with port security, but we cannot expect our ports or our borders to be airtight. The key is preventing the worst people from getting their hands on the worst weapons. This bill  implements several provisions that will be helpful in that regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it authorizes all funds necessary for the Nunn-Lugar program to help Russia get control over its thousands of potentially loose nukes, the weapons left over from the Cold War. Second, it authorizes all funds necessary for the Global Threat Reduction Initiative to get control of the 20 tons of highly enriched uranium at various nuclear reactor sites around the world, many of them unsecured. But I want to emphasize, this bill only authorizes funds and it will be meaningless unless we appropriate  the funds, and I look forward to an appropriation bill that does just that as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill imposes sanctions limiting the sale of U.S. weapons to those who provide centrifuges to Iran. I hope the administration will be able to report to us, before they send the F-16s, that Pakistan has verifiably and permanently halted its aid to the Iranian nuclear weapons program. This bill will do a lot, but we have to do more to prevent nuclear weapons from falling into the worst hands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also contains important provisions dealing with public diplomacy and youth education. I think that the United States should print the textbooks for the poorest nations in the world. In doing so, we can help parents in such poor countries--that make only a dollar a day or less--who are required to provide textbooks for their kids or their kids can't go to school. At the same time we can assure American taxpayers that our tax dollars are being used to help kids and not to teach hate. I  look forward to a foreign aid bill that focuses on the textbook needs of those in the poorest countries in the world.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400343" topic="AVIATION SECURITY--SCREENER TRAINING AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT STRENGTHENED, BUT MORE WORK REMAINS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are positive, even necessary, elements of this legislation; but nevertheless it is flawed. A major flaw reflects  what I believe, I think I state, a wrongheaded approach which is favored perhaps by the new majority of this current Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of a motion that will be offered later, the motion to recommit <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>. That motion is aimed at removing this damaging flaw that is currently part of the bill. The Proliferation Security Initiative, or the PSI, is a vital program created by the United States in which we team with 14 other partner countries to catch terrorists who attempt to transfer weapons of mass destruction. We created this program so that the United States and our allies could operate  independently and quickly without bureaucratic interference to stop the world's most dangerous terrorists. The PSI has been effective due to its independence as well as the member countries' commitments to stop these weapons transfers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This, as I say, has been an effective effort. It was created by Americans. It was led by Americans. And the decisions made were essentially under the leadership of Americans. The new majority in this House seems to favor a more multilateral approach which would be led by international organizations, in this case the United Nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> passes in its current form, so will a sense of Congress that says our Proliferation Security Initiative should be authorized by the United Nations. Our new majority in Congress appears more interested in catering to unelected bureaucrats at the United Nations than in stopping proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This is not only a dangerous mistake; it runs totally counter to the principles we have followed thus far in our country where Americans should be the main determinants  of those elements and those decisions that so much affect our security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I understand that the new majority prefers a more global approach which, of course, would leave us dependent on international bodies like the United Nations. But that is not an approach that I believe will make this country safer as reflected in this legislation. A sense of Congress that says we want to cede our power to the United Nations on any issue such as this but especially on matters of U.S. national security is a mistake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to correct this harmful error in <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> and vote in favor of the motion to recommit. And as we face these decisions in the future, as we make these very important decisions and as we develop legislation like this, let's remember our obligation is to the people of the United States. Our obligation is not to curry favor with unelected bureaucrats at the United Nations.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in the last Congress refused to do so, and I am glad we are doing it now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a New Yorker, I understand the serious concerns about homeland security, and I have long argued in favor of a formula funding based on risk. In the 109th Congress, Mr. Fossella and I introduced the Responsible Bioterrorism Funding Act of 2006, which directed the Department of Homeland Security to develop a funding formula based on risk. Unfortunately, again the Republican Congress did not pass our bill. So in 2006, as a result, New York's homeland security funding was cut by 40 percent.  Thus, per capita in New York we received $3 per resident while other States received as much as $60 or more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No State has a higher risk of terrorist attack than New York, so the new funding formulas proposed in this bill will allocate funding based on risk rather than an across-the-board funding level as established in the PATRIOT Act. This is very, very important and this bill strikes the balance between allocating most of the funding based on risk while ensuring that each State has the proper funding to reach a level of preparedness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also stand in strong support of title II of this bill, which establishes a communications interoperability grant program. I have worked on this as well. I believe this is a good part of this bill, and I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, especially its new security requirement for Pakistan to continue to receive U.S. taxpayer subsidies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>After September 11, the government of Pakistan performed admirably, allowing U.S. Army supplies to help our campaign in Afghanistan to end the Taliban dictatorship. The Pakistani military also moved into the lawless tribal areas where Osama Bin Laden sought refuge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that record of cooperation against Bin Laden has dramatically weakened over the last 9 months. In a set of two agreements, the government of Pakistan has largely given up on the conflict against Bin Laden and his Taliban allies. In two agencies along the Afghan borders, North and South Waziristan, al Qaeda and the Taliban now have safe havens immune from action by the regular Pakistani military. They are now at rest, slumbering in garrison, marvelously inactive against foreign terrorists  operating on Pakistani soil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This issue directly concerns the safety of Americans, both here and abroad. Waziristan and Pakistan could now be called "al Qaedastan," as terrorist leaders have led organization efforts in attacks against Afghan territory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently I accompanied Senators McCain and Lieberman to visit our garrison in Khost, Afghanistan, where they reported a 500-percent increase in attacks against their outpost organized from these regions of Pakistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we need to pass this legislation to send a message to Pakistan that you must continue to work with the United States and our NATO allies in Afghanistan against the Taliban and al Qaeda. A policy of safe havens and sanctuary for these people will not work, has not worked, is not working and represents a direct threat, first to Americans in uniform stationed in Afghanistan and later to our allies in Europe and America itself.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, one of the most important findings of the 9/11 Commission was that the failure to anticipate the attack was a failure of imagination. The idea of such an assault was so abhorrent it was difficult to think about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot know for sure what form a future attack may take, but as we struggle to prevent it, we must be willing to consider the most horrific possibility, a nuclear or biological attack on an American city. The idea of 100,000 people killed in an instant is an idea too terrible to contemplate. But to ignore this threat, or fail to act upon it with the greatest urgency is to be grossly, criminally, negligent with our Nation's security.</paragraph>

But the one fundamental idea is, we must prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or material because once it is acquired, it may be too late. This bill will strengthen the Global Threat Reduction Program and accelerate the global clean-out of the stockpiles around the world. And I urge everyone's support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, which is long overdue and I commend the Speaker and other members of the Leadership for making this a priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most important findings of the &#xD0;9/11 Commission was that the failure to anticipate the attack was a "failure of imagination." The idea of such an assault was so abhorrent that it was difficult to think about. We cannot know for sure what form a future attack may take, but as we struggle to prevent it, we must be willing to consider the most horrific possibility: a nuclear or biological attack on an American city. The idea of 100,000 people killed in an instant, is an idea too terrible  to  contemplate, but to ignore this threat, or fail to act upon it with the greatest urgency, is to be grossly, criminally neglegent with our Nation's security. Osama bin Laden has termed the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction "a religious duty." He has called for an American Hiroshima. This is his Mein Kampf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> includes many of the best ideas from around the country on how to combat nuclear terrorism. But the one fundamental idea is that we must prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or material, because once they are acquired, it may be too late.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Programs throughout the government are struggling to secure nuclear weapons and materials around the world, and prevent nuclear trafficking. But there is little overall organization of these efforts. That's why our bill establishes a Coordinator for the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism in the Office of the President. The Coordinator will formulate and coordinate a comprehensive strategy for U.S. nonproliferation activities, oversee all nonproliferation and  nuclear terrorism prevention programs, and advise the President and congress on the progress that each program is making.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To assist the Coordinator, this bill establishes a bipartisan blue-ribbon commission to assess the current state of U.S. nonproliferation and nuclear terrorism prevention activities, develop a clear, comprehensive strategy, and identify the areas in which accelerated effort is most urgent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, the President must certify that Russia is meeting certain conditions before authorizing the release of Cooperative Threat Reduction funds. This has caused delays in shielding vulnerable weapons when the President was unable to fully certify Russia. This bill removes those restrictions, granting the President more flexibility in negotiations with Russia. It also gives the President the flexibility to direct Cooperative Threat Reduction funds outside of Russia when necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill will strengthen the Global Threat Reduction Program, to accelerate the global clean-out of the most vulnerable stockpiles of nuclear material. At the current pace, cleaning up the most vulnerable nuclear sites around the globe will take more than a decade. Given AQ's desire for these weapons, how can we be assured that we will have this much time--we can't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also urges the President to expand the Proliferation Security Initiative, an international program to intercept weapons of mass destruction shipments. It encourages joint training exercises, particularly with China and Russia, to strengthen our cooperation on security issues, and encourage them to adopt strict standards for WMD security. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1540 broached the idea of international standards for securing nuclear material, but was brief on the specifics. Now  the U.S. must take the lead in establishing those standards, through organizations like the Proliferation Security Initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope everyone can support this long-awaited overhaul to our anti-nuclear-terrorism efforts.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at the outset, let me just thank the majority for bringing this bill to the floor because I think most Americans want Democrats and Republicans to ensure that all America remains safe and secure, and not to repeat another September 11. And, by and large, there are some very good elements in the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let me, right at the outset, request that as we go forward, there are some specific concerns that New York City has that I think need to be addressed. First is the notion that the city itself cannot apply directly. It must go through the State without any requirement for the State to get the funds to the localities like New York City. We know by now that New York City has specific needs, and therefore, I believe should be addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The same would apply to what could be a duplicative process whereby the grant program, and as someone who was involved in the establishment the first grant program under the Department of Commerce, where, as we speak, the NTIA is in the process of preparing guidelines, my concern is that we don't get into a situation where there are two different agencies getting into a bureaucratic trap which will prevent the flow of money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most important, however, is the fact that we know that one size does not fit all. And I speak specifically that, under the current bill, there could be, and I think will be, a problem with the restriction to Section 306. And that is that over the last 10 years, New York City has dedicated a lot of money and, in the last 5 years, since 9/11, almost $1 billion to upgrade its interoperability capacity to allow firefighters and police officers to talk with each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, under this bill, we are essentially saying that everyone must use the 700 megahertz in the spectrum. New York City cannot. As I say, they have developed and deployed $1 billion plus in the 400 and the 800 megahertz of the spectrum. Why? Because they found it easier to use that for communicating into the subways, into high rise buildings. And the last thing I think this Congress wants to be on the record for is to essentially tie the hands of New York City, undo much of the good work that  has taken place over the last 5 years, and allow New York City and other localities that have unique and specific needs to continue to deploy and build on the networks that they have put in place. I think it would be a big mistake. I encourage the majority to consider this as the process goes forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I make no mistake and make no hesitation in suggesting that this will hurt and punish New York City and the millions and tens of millions of people who come there annually to visit the greatest city in the world.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here today as we deliver on one of the most important campaign promises our party made to the American people, implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations. Today we will take steps to improve our Nation's aviation, port and transportation security. We will strengthen government intelligence and information sharing, and we will prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. And we will create a dedicated source of funding to provide  first responders with communications interoperability equipment that will allow our first responders to communicate across departmental and jurisdictional lines during emergencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was over 5 years ago when evacuation orders were not heard in the towers of the World Trade Center because police and fire fighters and other emergency personnel simply could not talk to each other. The Federal Government failed to act. And these same communication problems happened again during the failed response following Hurricane Katrina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a representative of the Philadelphia region, a major population, commerce, and transportation hub, I share the opinion that we have to do something about this. It is scandalous not to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with you as we deliver on one of the most important campaign promises our party made to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we will implement the bipartisan 9/11 Commission's recommendations. And, today we will make our Nation safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will: improve our Nation's aviation, port and transportation security; strengthen government intelligence and information sharing; help reduce the appeal of extremism abroad; and prevent terrorists from acquiring Weapons of Mass Destruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will also create a dedicated source of funding to provide first responders with communications interoperability--the type of equipment that allows local, state, and regional first responders to communicate with one another during emergencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that the inability to communicate across department and jurisdiction lines impedes first responder's ability to address emergency situations. It was over five years ago when evacuation orders were not heard in the towers of the World Trade Center because the police, fire fighters and other emergency personnel simply could not speak to each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite this, the Federal Government failed to act and these very same communications problems happened again during the failed response and recovery efforts in the Gulf region following Hurricane Katrina. Prompting, in part, Thomas Kean, former chair of the 9/11 Commission, to call the Republican-led Congress' lack of progress on this issue scandalous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, local communities across the Nation have been moving forward--despite little leadership from the Federal level. In my region, the Philadelphia Police Department along with Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority are working to address the fact that  their radio systems are not compatible--making it virtually impossible for them to communicate should a coordinated response be necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been working closely with city and transit officials to find interim remedies to this problem. However, it has been a difficult task, in large part, because of the lack of guidance and resources provided by the Federal Government. In fact, when they applied for a grant to help fund an interoperable communications system, the Department of Homeland Security denied their request. This denial leaves the city of Philadelphia, its transit system and the millions of daily riders, residents and  workers in the region vulnerable to attack. It also leaves the city's first responders less prepared than need to be to protect the fifth largest metropolitan region in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, Mr. Speaker, today is a new day. It is a day when Congress acknowledges our Nation's first responders--police officers, fire fighters, medics. It is a day when we give these brave women and men the tools to properly aid their fellow Americans in need of help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The aptly numbered bill--H.R. 1--will pass this body within the first 100 legislative hours of the 110th Congress, and it demonstrates that the Democratic-led Congress' top priority is protecting and ensuring the safety of the American people.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Queens and Nassau County, Mr. Ackerman, for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I listened very closely to my colleague from Staten Island, Mr. Fossella, and his concerns about any disadvantage that New York may suffer under passage of this legislation. It is not our intention or anyone's intention to have New York be disadvantaged in any way, shape or form.

    <paragraph>But Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>. After the awful events of September 11, our Nation joined together to construct ways to prevent this from happening again and for better protecting our homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this administration, the Bush administration, and Congress then refused to act or to listen properly. The Republicans refused to implement commonsense recommendations ensuring Federal Homeland Security dollars went to places where they were actually needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republicans did not take threat or risk assessment into account for protecting our homeland. Rather, the Republicans took politics into account.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats are fixing these problems and providing real security to all 300 million Americans, regardless of political persuasion. Democrats are making sure all of our first responders in harm's way are given the training they need to perform and protect our citizens. Democrats are cracking down on loose nukes and strengthening nuclear proliferation to keep weapons out of the wrong hands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For over 5 years I have heard the Republicans play politics with homeland security and with the lives and the memories of the 3,000 people who were murdered on 9/11. Their scare tactics expired this November when the American people demanded real change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Homeland security is about protecting the homeland and not politics or 30-second ads. We Democrats recognize that.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, the remaining time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen, Mr. Speaker, how ineffectively the United Nations Security Council has been in compelling Syria to stop its support for terrorist activities in Lebanon or at least keeping to its own deadlines regarding Iran's nuclear program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After decades of rampant anti-Americanism at the United Nations, after decades of opposition and obstruction regarding virtually every aspect of U.S. foreign policy, no one can truly believe that the United Nations Security Council would draft its resolutions to advance the interests of the United States or that any U.N. entity would help the U.S. image in the Arab and Muslim world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I need only point to the continuing efforts by Russia and China to hobble U.S. efforts at the U.N. that would seek to apply pressure on Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us consider the UNDP, for example. In 2005, as Israel was withdrawing from Gaza, financed by the Palestinian Authority's production of propaganda materials, it included banners, bumper stickers, T-shirts bearing the slogan: "Today, Gaza; tomorrow, the West Bank and Jerusalem." This is the United Nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This rightly led to protests from then U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton who rightly called this funding inappropriate and unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we know the record of the UNDP of hostility toward economic freedom. Has anyone really thought this through? This needs to be revamped, and the bill before us does not address that in a correct way to have it be pro-U.S. and pro-U.S. national security.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 5 years after 9/11, we still have no national security strategy for securing public transportation, the principal form of transportation most Americans use, 9 billion passenger trips annually. No wonder the 9/11 commission gave a C minus grade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill rescues us by requiring the Department of Homeland Security to develop risk-based priorities for transportation security and, finally, a strategic information plan so that the private sector, which owns our modes of transportation, can share information with one another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the terrorists have changed their focus, as Madrid and London made clear. We have not.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for a bill that is supposed to carry out a series of partisan campaign promises on national security and homeland security issues, what is most notable about this bill is actually the many areas that it highlights where there has been bipartisan agreement, not only on the provisions of the 9/11 Commission that should be implemented, but just as importantly, those recommendations that should not be implemented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 109th Congress, the House acted to address many of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. A number of these reforms were included in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, in which the Intelligence Committee played a prominent role. Others were addressed and refined in later legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On intelligence matters, many of the items in this bill are duplications or slight modifications to initiatives that were already put into place during the preceding Congress, such as support to the fusion of border intelligence and provisions to facilitate greater information sharing on homeland security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As another key example, this bill would create a new Office of the United States Coordinator for the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism. This duplicates and complicates the work of the National Counterproliferation Center created in the Intelligence Reform bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also think it is important to point out that contrary to campaign promises, this bill does not implement all of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Let me note a few, the intelligence budget, and paramilitary activities, that it does not address at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is following the lead of the previous Congress and not implementing the two recommendations  that were not warranted, declassifying the amount of the intelligence budget and making the Department of Defense the lead for all paramilitary operations. These decisions were right for our national security on the merits in the last Congress, and they are still right for our national security now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate that this bill follows and reinforces Republican positions on these issues where the 9/11 Commission recommendations were not good policy. This bill also curiously omits another explicit recommendation of the 9/11 Commission that the majority party's representation on the intelligence oversight committee should never exceed the minority's representation by one. If the new majority wants to claim that it has implemented all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations, it cannot pick and  choose to implement all of its recommendations except the ones that involve their own power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later today, the House will also consider a resolution that purports to address the 9/11 Commission's recommendation to consolidate intelligence oversight in Congress and enhance the influence of the authorizing committee on the appropriations process. The proposal will not accomplish the objectives sought by the 9/11 Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commission recommended that the authorizing committee also become the Appropriations Committee. The last Congress thought that that was a bad idea, and we didn't do it. The proposal in front of us today will further add complication and confusion by creating a third group in the House with responsibility for intelligence. Actually, in the last Congress, we pretty much achieved what the 9/11 Commission was trying to accomplish, where we had basically a seamless integration of the Intelligence  Committee authorizations bill reflected in the appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to point out that this bill was flawed in much more than its failure to promise to fully implement the commission recommendations. As ranking member and former chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I am concerned that parts of it have significant potential to impact our Nation's critical intelligence programs and capabilities. Even worse, these provisions were developed outside of regular order, without any participation from the relevant committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to briefly note my concerns with two of these provisions. Section 1433 of the bill would require the United States to "develop a common coalition approach" with respect to detainees. This proposal is much broader in scope and effect than the actual recommendation of the 9/11 Commission, and it is bad policy. I would hope that all Members of the House would be in agreement that the law should not require the United States of America to ask for the permission of other countries, even our  partners, to gather intelligence from and deal effectively and appropriately with detainees and terrorists who threaten our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, this proposal would significantly implicate an already challenging area by requiring us to reconcile newly clarified detainee authority with the policies of some nations whose legal authorities protecting human rights are nowhere near as well developed as ours. In addition, this bill would reopen previously negotiated and resolved issues by making the Civil Liberties Board an independent body in granting its subpoena authority. Overall, it would complicate intelligence.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>On 9/11, many of us were here in the Capitol. As we saw smoke billowing from the Pentagon, we recognized the direct threat that faced our country. We stood together on the steps of this buildings, Republicans and Democrats together, and promised the American people that we would do our best to secure this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we have failed the American people. The 9/11 Commission graded the administration in this Congress with five Fs, twelve Ds, and nine Cs; and we must accept no less than straight As. Our Nation responded with overwhelming support to the commission's recommendations, and that is why I urge all of you to join me today in voting for <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will make us safer, but it is just a first step. A TV station in Houston recently uncovered serious security holes at the Port of Houston. I mean that literally, holes. As they walked along the perimeter, they found several holes in the fences. This security breach at one of the Nation's largest ports is unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today this threat, this hole in our Nation's security, is being patched. Our safety is nonnegotiable, and we can no longer shortchange our ports. A vote for this bill today demonstrates our dedication to securing our Nation. It is a first step towards truly securing the Nation from threats, not only in our backyard, but to threats half a world away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I go home this Friday and greet the hardworking men and women of the 22nd Congressional District as they leave their plants and port facilities where they work, I can thank them for the risk they take every day and look them in the eye and finally tell them they will be safe and so will our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let us have no more smoke. Let us have no more holes. Let us do the right thing and pass <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 11, 2001 many of us were here in the Capitol. As we saw the smoke billowing from the Pentagon, we recognized the direct threat that faced our country. We stood together on the steps of this building, Republicans and Democrats together, and promised the American people that we would do our best to secure this nation. But for far too long we have failed the American people. In 2005 members of the 9/11 Commission graded both the Administration and Congress with 5 F's, 12 D's, 9 C's,  and 2 Incompletes. We must accept no less than straight A's. Our nation responded with overwhelming support of the Commission's recommendations, and as their representatives, we should implement them. That's why I urge all of you to join me today in voting for <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>. This bill will make us safer, but it's just the first step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long we have ignored the threat and been unwilling to meet the challenge. This is a challenge that we ignore at our own peril. Our Nation's seaports handle over 95 percent of our foreign trade worth over $1 trillion a year. The 9/11 Commission report concluded that terrorists have the "opportunity to do harm as great or greater in maritime and surface transportation" than the 9/11 attacks. In 2003 the Coast Guard estimated that it would need $7.2 billion to fully implement the security  requirements of the Maritime Transportation Security Act. Until recently, Congress had only provided $910 million for port security since the 9/11 attacks. We must fulfill our responsibility by fully funding these provisions, providing appropriate oversight and ensuring that these measures are implemented efficiently and effectively. Our safety is non-negotiable, and we can no longer short-change our ports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, a local TV station in Houston recently uncovered serious security holes at the Port of Houston, which borders the 22nd district. And I literally mean holes. As they  walked along the perimeter they found several holes in the fence. This is a fence that is meant to deter terrorists, yet there it is helping them gain access to these crucial facilities. This serious security breach at one of the nation's largest ports in one of the nation's largest  cities is unacceptable. And today this threat, this hole in our nation's security and my constituents' peace of mind, is being patched. Our safety is non-negotiable, and we can no longer short-change our ports. A vote for this bill today demonstrates our</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the first step towards truly securing our Nation, from threats in our own backyard to threats half a world away. This bill will enable us to improve our own security while fostering improved relations across the globe. I urge all of you, my colleagues here in the people's House, and I implore our colleagues in the Senate, to vote for this important piece of legislation. And I urge the president to sign it into law. And when I go home this Friday, and greet the hardworking men and women  of the 22nd Congressional District as they leave the plants and port facilities where they work, I can thank them for the risks they take everyday and look them in the eye and finally tell them they will be safe and so will our country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I want to commend, in the beginning, Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member King for the work of your staff, everybody chipped in; and I really want to commend the work that you have all done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is about time. Three years ago, the commission put forward a comprehensive evaluation of our Nation's vulnerabilities and listed key recommendations toward making our Nation safer, more secure. We finally passed landmark legislation to close many of the dangerous security gaps, and we are going to do that today. We will address the weaknesses that continue to leave this Nation at risk, and I say it is about time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than a year ago, Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita reminded us all again how unprepared we still are to deal with catastrophes, whether caused by nature or a terrorist attack. That is the politics. That is the charade. And that charade has been a deadly charade. The Congress will not wait another day to make the necessary improvements to our Homeland Security. This landmark legislation includes many long overdue steps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our ports and our critical infrastructure will be better protected. Our borders will be harder to enter. Terrorists will confront greater difficulty in obtaining nuclear materials, and our aviation will be better defended, just to name a few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly pleased with two major provisions. First, this bill would substantially increase the share of homeland security grants that are provided to States based on risk. I fought for this, the chairman has fought for this, I think you fought for this, Mr. Ranking Member. We want 100 percent risk on these grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is crucial that we ensure that Federal money designed to better equip and train our first responders actually reaches down to where it is needed most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have long said that the current system of distributing grant funding to local levels is fundamentally broken. In an era when information can be sent instantaneously any way, any place in the world, it is utterly nonsensical that our Nation's police, fire and EMS personnel cannot consistently communicate with each other. Not another day should pass without us addressing that. Anybody who says that we have addressed it, look at how the administration tried to zero out the interoperability part  of the legislation. Tell the truth.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400239" topic="AVIATION SECURITY--SCREENER TRAINING AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT STRENGTHENED, BUT MORE WORK REMAINS">
    <paragraph>Thank you very much, Mr. King and Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I might respond to the colleagues, this is the longest I have seen you, your presence on the floor in many a year, and your being in the podium. We will not let you get away as you would normally choose to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But having said that, Mr. Speaker, you know it is not my intention to speak on every authorizing bill that might come along. Indeed, we have enough work to do on our Appropriations Committee, enough to take up the time of our fine authorizers. But in the meantime, it is important for us to say early on, in these first 100 hours, that there are issues that will be brought to the floor that purport to reflect the interests of authorizers that have huge implications in so far as appropriations are  concerned. So for this one time I would like to take just a moment to discuss a bit of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I must mention that this bill is full of new programs, policy directives, performance directives, all kinds of authorizing suggestions, without any indication as to where the money might really be coming from. It is one thing to say that we want to establish a policy. It is another thing to say that we are going to pay as we go. It is an entirely different thing to say exactly where the money will come from.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very important for the Members to know that throughout this package that purports to deal with the 9/11 Commission, and those recommendations, that we have here to a very significant degree, within the authorizing process, a statement of policy that is little more than a press release. There really are no serious suggestions here as to how we go about solving the problems that are implied by the presentation of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tens of billions of dollars that would be required to implement this general statement of policy should not be ignored. It is not good enough to suggest that we are going to balance the budget and pay as we go. The first bill before us provides an authorizing base that does exactly the reverse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are not in this to confront the Appropriations Committee with authorizers, but indeed it is about time that we begin to lay the foundation for policy and appropriations work that actually reflects the will of the House as well as the appropriations process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I know that you agree with all of that because of your appropriations background.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation before us today. This is a bill full of feel-good promises and sound bites but no realistic approach to becoming a reality. Let me provide just a few illustrations of my concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I must mention that this bill is full of new programs, policy directives and performance directives authorized at "such sums as necessary," the total of which is likely to reach into the tens of billions of dollars. It proposes carving out $250 million from passenger ticket security fees as a "one-time deposit" for research, development, and deployment of Explosive Detection System checkpoint technology. But, because there is no guarantee  this amount can be covered by current collections, it will likely require a direct appropriation. In other words, it proposes a new cost, with no offset.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While some of these programs are worthwhile I am unsure how the new majority plans to actually fund them. This is a classic demonstration that the majority's pledge to offset any new increases in funding is, at this point, nothing more than an empty sound bite.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Absent new appropriations, there is little chance these programs, policy directives, and performance objectives will see the light of day. For example, this bill requires the inspection of 100 percent of the over 11 million U.S.-bound seaborne cargo containers within five years. While DHS currently inspects 100 percent of high-risk cargo, estimates to physically inspect 100 percent of sea-bound cargo, including those containers shipped by trusted  partners,  run in the tens of billions of dollars not counting additional manpower and operational costs. Even the editorial section of this morning's Washington Post describes the majority's container security proposal as a "waste of money" with a "marginal benefit" and no "realistic cost estimate".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, estimates to physically inspect all cargo on passenger planes for a single year exceed $500 million and may require up to an additional 8,000 screeners at a cost of $400 million per year. And on top of these annual costs, there is an upfront investment of over a billion dollars for equipment installation and facility modifications. Still, this legislation casually calls for 100 percent inspection by the end of Fiscal Year 2009.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, throwing money at a problem is not the solution. In fact, since 9/11, Congress has made steady and substantial, yet realistic, progress in many of these areas. In Fiscal Year 2005, we called for the tripling of the percentage of cargo screened on passenger aircraft, required quarterly updates on meeting this goal, and directed the development of standards and technology to reduce manpower requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We continue to target all high-risk cargo inbound for the United States. We also support expansion of our Container Security Initiative, which will place actual Customs and Border Protection employees at 58 of the world's largest ports, covering approximately 85 percent of the U.S.-bound shipping containers by the end of this fiscal year. Last year, the 109th Congress passed the SAFE Port Act, which, among other things, created pilot programs, each designed to test the possibility and viability  of achieving 100 percent screening overseas. Through the Secure Freight Initiative, the Administration has set up 9 of these pilot programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we appreciate the new majority's attempt, this bill is little more than a press release full of unfunded mandates that has little chance of becoming law. Real reform begins with committee and subcommittee hearings and mark-ups, and ends with a negotiated product that contains substantive yet realistic reform. This bill fails that, and many other, tests.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I now yield 1 minute to the majority leader, Mr. Hoyer.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="AVIATION SECURITY--SCREENER TRAINING AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT STRENGTHENED, BUT MORE WORK REMAINS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is no mere coincidence that this legislation, which will implement the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission, is designated as House Resolution No. 1 in this new Congress. Our first and highest responsibility as Members of this Congress is to protect the American people, to defend our homeland, and to strengthen our national security. The fact is, our Nation today, 5 1/2  years after the attacks of September 11th, is still not as safe as it should and must  be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Tom Kean, the former Republican Governor of New Jersey and cochair of the 9/11 Commission observed just a few months ago, "We're not protecting our own people in this country. The government is not doing its job." That is the former Republican Governor of New Jersey, the cochair of the Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, however, through this important legislation, this House will take a vital step forward in protecting our people and our Nation. We have taken steps, there is no doubt about that. We have taken steps together in a bipartisan way, but we have not taken all the steps we could take. And that is the point of the gentleman from Mississippi, and I support his contention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation among other things will substantially improve our homeland security by doing the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Significantly increasing the share of state homeland security grants provided on the basis of risk. I know that my good friend, the former chairman of the committee, agrees with that proposition. In fact, we passed it through this House; unfortunately, the Senate did not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Creating a stand-alone grant program for interoperable communications for first responders. Curt Weldon and I have chaired for a long time the Fire Service Caucus. Interoperability is a critical issue for our country and for our security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Phasing in the requirement of 100 percent inspection of air cargo over the next 3 years and 100 percent scanning of U.S.-bound shipping containers over the next 5 years. How can we have security in America if literally thousands of tons of cargo is being shipped in either by air or ship that we don't know its content?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accelerating the installation of explosive detection systems for checked baggage. A critical step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> will help us prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. It will strengthen the cooperative threat reduction or Nunn-Lugar programs; create a coordinator for the prevention of weapons of mass destruction proliferation and terrorism; and strengthen efforts to eliminate a nuclear black market network. I would think all of us would want to see those objectives accomplished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> seeks to reduce extremism by enhancing the International Arab and Muslim Youth Opportunity Fund and establishing a Middle East foundation that will promote economic opportunities, education reform, human rights and democracy in the Middle East, all of which was proposed by Governor Kean, Mr. Hamilton and unanimously the 9/11 Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also bears noting, Mr. Speaker, that this bill will strengthen the Privacy and Civil Liberties Board, removing the board from the executive office of the President and making it an independent agency and granting the board subpoena power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mention these provisions because I believe they demonstrate that we can improve our security without compromising the democratic principles upon which this great Nation was founded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let no one, however, be mistaken: This legislation alone, nor perhaps any legislation, can immunize our Nation from attack. However, it represents an important step forward for our national security. That is why we wanted to accomplish it in the first 100 hours of our deliberation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As former Congressman Lee Hamilton, the other cochair of the 9/11 Commission noted, Mr. Speaker, just yesterday, "The bottom line is, if this bill, <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, is enacted, funded and implemented, then the American people will be safer."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is our objective. I am confident that is the objective of every Member of this House, Democrat or Republican. That is our responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, to support this critically important piece of legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400219" topic="AVIATION SECURITY--SCREENER TRAINING AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT STRENGTHENED, BUT MORE WORK REMAINS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a tribute to the enormous influence you wield over this House, you will notice that even though we are the authorizing committee, the first two speakers are members of your Appropriations Committee, and I yield 5 1/2  minutes to the ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee, Mr. Rogers.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400340" topic="AVIATION SECURITY--SCREENER TRAINING AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT STRENGTHENED, BUT MORE WORK REMAINS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and thank the Speaker, and I particularly want to thank the ranking member of the committee who yielded for all of his tremendous efforts over the past years to prevent terrorism and secure the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is not a more fundamental purpose of our government than to provide for the safety and security of our people. That was the guiding principle as we over the last several years have provided almost $250 billion toward Federal homeland security programs since 9/11. But, Mr. Speaker, the ideas and proposals contained within this bill are overly costly and Draconian even. It is an effort by the new Democrat majority to look aggressive on homeland security. This bill will waste  billions and possibly harm homeland security by gumming up progress already under way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last 4 years, our Subcommittee on Homeland Security Appropriations provided a significant combination of aggressive oversight and vast resources to address our most critical homeland security needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, with port, cargo, and container security. We not only have appropriated over $16 billion to fully support groundbreaking programs, such as the Container Security Initiative, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, we required DHS to double its inspection and radiation screening efforts; target 100 percent of incoming cargo, establish security standards for both land and sea cargo containers; maintain 100 percent manifest review and trusted shipper validation standards; and inspect 100 percent  of all high-risk cargo. So rather than take the costly and Draconian approach included in this bill before us today, we put in place methodical, robust measures that balance our security needs with legitimate trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You need look no further than this morning's Washington Post editorial,  and I want to quote from it because I think it says it better than certainly I can. A quote from this Washington Post this morning:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Given a limited amount of money and an endless list of programs and procedures that could make Americans safer, it's essential to buy the most homeland security possible with the cash available. That can be a tough job. That's all the more reason not to waste money on the kind of political shenanigan written into a sprawling Democratic bill, up for a vote in the House this week, that would require the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that every maritime cargo container bound for the  U.S. is scanned before it departs for American shores."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Continuing to quote from the Washington Post: "Container scanning technology is improving, but it is not able to perform useful, speedy inspections of cargo on the scale House Democrats envision. Congress has already authorized pilot programs to study the feasibility of scanning all maritime cargo. The sensible posture is to await the results of those trials before buying port scanners, training the thousands who would be needed to operate them and gumming up international trade."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Continuing to quote from the Washington Post this morning:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The Democrats don't offer a realistic cost estimate for the mandate they will propose today, but the cost to the government and the economy is sure to be in the tens of billions and quite possibly hundreds of billions annually. The marginal benefit isn't close to being worth the price. Under recently expanded programs, all cargo coming into the country is assessed for risk and, when necessary, inspected, all without the cost of expensive scanning equipment, overseas staff and long waits at  foreign ports. Perhaps that's why the September 11th Commission didn't recommend 100 percent cargo scanning."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Quoting the Washington Post further:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The newly installed House leadership will bring the bill, which contains a range of other homeland security proposals both deserving and undeserving, directly to the floor, bypassing the Homeland Security Committee."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No hearings, just bring it on. That is the Washington Post, and I couldn't say it better than did the Post.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the issue of aviation security, we took a strong stance towards the implementation of security technologies by providing almost $17.3 billion towards aviation security programs, including almost $2 billion for explosive detection systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On border security and immigration enforcement, we provided over $75 billion over the last 4 years and ended, yes ended, the practice of catch-and-release once and for all. We have made progress on grants to State and local first responders on issues surrounding intelligence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In sum, Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today simply validates the funding and policy initiatives of the past two Congresses. I believe our record of accomplishments as well as the overwhelming bipartisan support of each and every one of the four appropriations bills speaks for itself. Now is the time to build upon the substantial work of the last 4 years and seriously debate our homeland security needs rather than recycle political ideas for political ends.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I commend him for his management of this legislation, bringing this urgent matter to the floor, and expediting its consideration. I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, legislation Congress should have passed long ago to address the unfulfilled 9/11 Commission recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the incoming chair of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, I can tell you there is no time to waste in enacting and implementing this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, no one should suppose that this will be easy. This is an ambitious agenda for the Department, and based on the Department's performance to date, it is going to have to rise considerably to meet that challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be challenges for us in Congress as well, as my friend the immediate past chairman of our Appropriations Subcommittee has just stressed. These are not going to be easy priorities to meet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the bill's programs are not currently funded, such as the Interoperable Communications Grant Program. This means that the Appropriations Committee and in particular our subcommittee will have to find additional resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress will also have to provide rigorous oversight of the Department's implementation of the bill. I look forward to working with Chairman Thompson and other colleagues to hold the Department accountable. The President must also do his part by requesting and supporting the funding to get the job done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides significant discretion for determining risk to the Department of Homeland Security. Now, discretion is fine, but it must be used fairly and wisely, backed by tested assumptions and rigorous methodology and firm data. This is a critical area for stringent oversight by Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we move to a more risk-based approach, there are two important points to make: First, as we have funded new homeland security grant programs dedicated to helping State and local governments prepare for and respond to terrorism, the President and Congress have at the same time reduced funding for the broadly targeted programs our first responders have depended on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Department of Justice programs that support police received a total of $1.5 billion in 2003, but by 2006, that was reduced to $559 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Fire grants received $745 million in 2003 but only $662 million for 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many State and local governments, this is simply robbing Peter to pay Paul, because their homeland security grant dollars have to be stretched to fill gaps left by the defunding of these other programs. It should not be an either/or proposition. We need healthy funding levels for both homeland security grants and for the more broadly based fire grants and COPS and Byrne and other Department of Justice grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second important point is that homeland security means more than security from man-made disasters. No matter where a disaster occurs and whether it is natural or man-made, our local police and firefighters and EMTs will be the first on the scene to help the public. The Department's risk assessments should do more to take that into account.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, Mr. Speaker, this bill is a critical first step in the process of making real security improvements, but there are many, many more steps we are going to have to take. I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle as we travel down this critical path.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400341" topic="AVIATION SECURITY--SCREENER TRAINING AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT STRENGTHENED, BUT MORE WORK REMAINS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to associate myself with the remarks of the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, Mr. Rogers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman stated, homeland security is too important an issue not to have any oversight. And the 279-page bill we consider today is too encompassing not to have any jurisdiction consideration by the committees of jurisdiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On such an important issue as protecting our country from terrorist attacks, we should have the opportunity to offer and debate amendments on the specific provisions of this bill. For example, the bill contains provisions authorizing billions of dollars in spending for new programs that have not been approved by the Committee on Homeland Security. The bill misses the opportunity to continue our consolidation of committee jurisdiction started in the 109th Congress over DHS and called for by the  9/11 Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also contains revisions to many initiatives developed under the  Republican leadership. For example, Section 812 of the bill expands the authorities of the Privacy Officer of the Department of Homeland Security. This vital position was established by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, a Republican bill, signed by President Bush into law. This was the first statutory mandate for a Privacy Officer in the executive branch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another Republican bill which the President signed into law, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, elevated the position of the Privacy Officer authorizing its direct reporting to the Secretary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Concerns have been raised that the pending bill would turn the Privacy Officer into an investigating officer. In fact, this proposal was specifically rejected last year during a markup in the Subcommittee on Management, Integration and Oversight, which I chaired. The DHS Inspector General stated that this provision would interfere with his role and would "create duplicative investigations and overlapping demands for documents involved in investigations of privacy violations."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, Mr. Speaker, I will include this letter in the RECORD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, December 28, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN ROGERS: Thank you for the opportunity to comment on two proposed amendments to the authority of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Privacy Officer--H.R. 3041 and <bill type="s" number="2827">S. 2827</bill>, both titled as the "Privacy Officer with Enhanced Rights Act" or "POWER Act." The Office of Inspector General (OIG) opposes these amendments because they would interfere with OIG's jurisdiction and create duplicative investigations and overlapping demands for documents involved in investigations  of privacy violations. Therefore, should either proposal be considered for further review, OIG strongly recommends that specific language be included to clearly state that the DHS OIG has primary authority over investigations, audits, and other inquiries that might be conducted by the Privacy Officer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As currently drafted, <bill type="h" number="3041">H.R. 3041</bill> and <bill type="s" number="2827">S. 2827</bill> would grant the DHS Privacy Officer authority to investigate; issue reports; administer or require oaths, affirmations or affidavits; issue subpoenas (except to Federal agencies); and access records and other materials related to programs and operations within the Chief Privacy Officer's jurisdiction. These authorities are, as stated above, duplicative. With respect to the proposed investigatory authority, the DHS Inspector General already has authority  to investigate violations of law and regulations, including privacy-related violations relating to DHS programs and operations. Granting parallel authority to the Privacy Officer to investigate and issue subpoenas would unnecessarily and inefficiently duplicate and disrupt the established and working authority of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regarding the proposed subpoena authority for the Privacy Officer, each branch of the Federal government already has extensive subpoena authorities that are regularly exercised to obtain documents or testimony to investigate misconduct such as civil rights violations. In the event of  a significant allegation concerning such a violation, there would already be overlapping and likely immediate demands for documents and testimony by the Executive Branch, by the Congress, and through the Courts. Adding a set of competing subpoenas from the DHS Privacy Officer would unnecessarily increase the burden on subpoenaed parties by requiring them to respond to multiple requests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The OIG therefore strongly recommends that the following new subsection be added under section (b)(2) of both amendments:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) DHS OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL AUTHORITY--The exercise of authority by the senior official appointed under this section shall be subject to, and shall not interfere with, the authority of the DHS Office of Inspector General. Prior to initiating any investigation under this section, the senior official shall refer the allegation to be investigated to the Inspector General. If the Inspector General initiates an audit, investigation, or inspection relating to the allegation, the Inspector General  may provide notice that it has initiated an inquiry. If the Inspector General issues such a notice, no other audit or investigation shall be initiated into the matter by the senior official appointed under this section, and any other audit, investigation, or other inquiry of the matter shall cease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision will ensure the OIG's ability to perform its independent statutory responsibilities under the Inspector General Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regarding variations between <bill type="h" number="3041">H.R. 3041</bill> and <bill type="s" number="2827">S. 2827</bill>, the amendments differ in three respects:</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3041">H.R. 3041</bill> includes a vaguely-worded provision, tying the Privacy Officer's authority to that of the Inspector General. The bill authorizes the Privacy Officer to: "take any other action that may be taken by the Inspector General of the Department, as necessary to require employees of the Department to produce documents and answer questions relevant to performance of the functions of the senior official under this section." <bill type="h" number="304">H.R. 304</bill>l(B)(l)(E). <bill type="s" number="2827">S. 2827</bill> does not have a similar provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3041">H.R. 3041</bill> includes a five-year term limit for the Privacy Officer. <bill type="s" number="2827">S. 2827</bill> has no such limit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2827">S. 2827</bill> places the Privacy Officer under the general supervision of the Secretary and requires the Secretary to report to Congress "promptly" if the Officer is removed or transferred to another position. <bill type="s" number="2827">S. 2827</bill> does not have a similar provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to <bill type="h" number="304">H.R. 304</bill>l's provision tying the Privacy Officer's authority to that of the DHS Inspector General, it is not clear what authority would be granted by this provision. It appears to be designed to incorporate certain Inspector General authorities into the Privacy Officer's  statutory authorities. As drafted, it is not clear whether the scope of the Privacy Officer's authorities under this provision is limited to privacy issues and if it is so limited, how "privacy issues" are defined, and by whom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regarding the term of office provision included in <bill type="h" number="3041">H.R. 3041</bill>, but not in <bill type="s" number="2827">S. 2827</bill>, and placement under the Secretary's general supervision (included in <bill type="h" number="3041">H.R. 3041</bill>, but not in <bill type="s" number="2827">S. 2827</bill>), OIG does not believe these two variations significantly distinguish the proposed amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In summary, OIG opposes the proposed amendments because they would create duplication in investigations and overlapping demands for documents involved in investigations of privacy violations. If either proposal be enacted, it should include an additional provision stating that any exercise of authority by the Privacy Officer should not interfere with, and should not be construed as limiting, the authority of the Inspector General.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this legislation. Questions regarding these comments may be addressed to Richard N. Reback, Counsel to the Inspector General, on (202) 254-4100.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Richard L. Skinner,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The pending bill would also grant the Privacy Officer access to "all records" and other materials available to DHS. Such sweeping access could have a chilling effect on intelligence agencies sharing vital information with DHS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Inspector General has urged amendments to protect his independent responsibilities under the Inspector General Act. DHS has also requested amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we don't have that option. It is ironic that on the same day this bill is being considered in the House under a closed rule, the Senate is holding a hearing on the same topic. And Senators will have an opportunity later to offer amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today should be subject to the same bipartisanship and open process. The stakes are too high, and we need to get it right.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="AVIATION SECURITY--SCREENER TRAINING AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT STRENGTHENED, BUT MORE WORK REMAINS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride and a sense of hope for the future that I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, legislation which fulfills an important promise we Democrats made to fully implement the 9/11 Commission's recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before continuing, I want to commend the Honorable Bennie Thompson on his ascension to the chairmanship of the House Committee on Homeland Security. Congressman Thompson served as a first-rate ranking member of the committee during the last Congress, and I look forward to working with him and our now Ranking Member King to further strengthen our Nation's security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it has been a matter of great consternation that today, 5-plus years after 9/11, our first responders still do not have the capacity to communicate consistently with each other during emergencies. It was one of the tragic failures in Katrina as late as 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> will create a national Emergency Communication Plan and a stand-alone emergency communications grant program that will finally provide first responders with the kind of standards and equipment they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another provision that has been long fought for is 100 percent inspection of cargo on passenger planes as well as 100  percent screening of containers bound for this country and improved explosive detection systems at passenger checkpoints at our Nation's airports. One of the "F" grades the administration and the last Congress received was failure to implement risk-based funding. The new formula is a great step forward and would provide more funding  for States and territories that adjoin a body of water within North America that contains an international boundary line. This can assist the U.S. Virgin Islands in providing the additional border patrol needed to protect our residents and our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, in March of 2001, a member of the Hart Commission told a bipartisan group that the greatest threat to us was the growing animosity towards the United States. Today we are more hated than ever. Changing this and protecting privacy and civil liberties as provided in <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> is critical to making America not only safer but better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we owe <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> to those who died on 9/11 and their families. Its passage is critical to the future of our great Nation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride and a sense of hope for the future security of our Nation that I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>--legislation which fulfills an important promise we Democrats made to the American people last fall--to pass legislation within the first 100 hours of our assuming the majority in the House of Representatives, to make the Nation safer by fully implementing the 9/11 Commission's recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before continuing with my remarks in support of this bill, Mr. Speaker, I want to applaud you for the inspired principled and strong leadership which enabled you to become speaker of this great Body and to commend my Chairman, the Honorable Bennie Thompson on his ascension as to the Chairmanship of the Homeland Security in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bennie served as a first-rate ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee during the last Congress and I look forward to working with him to further strengthen the state of our homeland security and in fact to pass today many of the measures that he championed and Democrats supported in the preceding Congress but could not get passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, last year the bipartisan 9/11 Commissioners gave Congress and the administration a number of very poor grades including 5 Fs, 12 Ds and 2 incompletes on implementing their recommendations. These woeful grades were a call for action and today Democrats are answering that call.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it has been a matter of great consternation that today, 5 plus years after&#xD0;9/11, our first responders do not have the capacity to communicate consistently with each other during emergencies. It was one of the tragic failures in Katrina in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the long overdue steps included in <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> that will substantially improve homeland security is the creation of a stand-alone emergency communications grant program that will provide first responders with the standards and type of equipment they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure that we have wasted not only time, but a lot of money in funding the purchasing of equipment that cannot talk to each other because we have not had standards or a plan. Most importantly, today with this legislation, we create a national Emergency Communication Plan that will guide the implementation of the grant program. I want to applaud my colleague Congresswoman LOWEY for her persistence on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another group of provisions that have been long fought for and are now included in <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, will be the requirement that ED MARKEY of Massachusetts has championed for 100 percent inspection of cargo in passenger planes by 2009. This bill will also provide for 100 percent screening of containers bound for this country and improve explosive detection systems at passenger checkpoints at our Nation's airports such as we have seen already implemented in other countries such as Canada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot leave this floor without speaking about another issue that is very important to my constituents and that relates to our need for strengthened border security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the F grades the administration and the last Congress received was on failure to implement risk-based funding. Over the past year we have seen increased border crossings using the USVI to enter the United States. The new formula would provide for a larger minimum for States--and that includes territories according to the definition--that adjoin a body of water within North America that contains an international boundary line which we do. This can assist us in providing the additional border  patrol needed to protect not just our residents in the U.S. Virgin Islands but our entire Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't have time to speak to all of the important provisions included in <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, but in closing let me mention one more that I believe gets to the heart of what is needed to protect the United States and all who live here--and that is the provisions that help to restore the moral authority and leadership of our country in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recall that a bipartisan retreat in March of 2001, a member of the Hart Commission told us that the Commission had determined that the greatest threat to us was the growing animosity toward the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While some steps have been taken since that report and the terrible events that took place 7 months later to protect us from terrorist attacks, nothing has been done to improve our relationships with our global neighbors. In fact we are more hated now than ever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> takes steps to begin to heal the rift that has been widening between the United States and Arab and Muslim communities and between us and the rest of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also my hope that along with the provisions for stronger protections for privacy and civil liberties, we can also mitigate some of the unintended consequences of the broad brush approaches that have been taken thus far.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are critical components of setting a new direction for our country and making America not only safer but better!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, implementing the 9/11 Commission's recommendations is supported by most Americans and by several bipartisan and nonpartisan groups and we owe <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> to those who died on 9/11 and their families and loved ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, this is a proud day for me and for all Americans as we take this action to improve homeland security by preventing terrorists from acquiring WMD's, by improving our intelligence mechanisms and prevention and protection programs, and by developing strategies for preventing the growth and spread of terrorism, while safeguarding the rights of all and the integrity of our Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a bill that is critical to the future of our great Nation and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400654" topic="AVIATION SECURITY--SCREENER TRAINING AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT STRENGTHENED, BUT MORE WORK REMAINS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, on which I am proud to serve, for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, but I also rise to express my disappointment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the importance of a bipartisan approach to homeland security and promises made to the contrary, the new majority has chosen to prevent even their own rank and file members from participating in the debate over this bill. This stands in stark contrast to how Republicans implemented 39 of the 41 9/11 Commission recommendations when we were in the majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill raises several concerns. It proposes to require the Department of Homeland Security to screen 100 percent of maritime cargo containers bound for the United States. And while well intentioned, this is not possible with current technology. Under the SAFE Port Act passed in the last Congress, we started a pilot project to determine the feasibility of such a program. We should continue and await the results of this study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new unfunded mandate would cost the government and the economy billions of dollars per year and bring commerce to a crashing halt. And even the Washington Post today called this a "bad investment." <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> also gives foreign port terminal operators a role in the screening of cargo containers bound for U.S. seaports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most disturbing of all, <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> proposes to hand over control of the Proliferation Security Initiative, a system which works to protect Americans against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to the United Nations. This is the same United Nations of which Syria and Iran are members. As a former counter terrorism official in the U.S. Department of Justice, I know first hand the threat of terrorism. It is very much alive and well. And while I am overall supportive of this bill and the  9/11 Commission recommendations, Congress can and should do better.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400124" topic="AVIATION SECURITY--SCREENER TRAINING AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT STRENGTHENED, BUT MORE WORK REMAINS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Murtha, it is wonderful to see you in the chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise as a proud cosponsor of this legislation, which is really going to complete the outstanding work of the 9/11 Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The issue that I want to focus my remarks on today is one that my colleagues and I have worked very hard on on a bipartisan basis on the Energy and Commerce Committee for many years, and that is how to guarantee real communication interoperability between first responders. This is a very, very important issue for all of our first responders and our communities. The fact is that interoperability can be solved today. Advanced technology developed across the United States and certainly in my district  in the Silicon Valley can successfully enable first responders and others to communicate using disparate communication devices and networks. The problem up to this point has been a lack of resources and guidance from the Federal Government as to where and how local first responders should invest their scarce dollars to achieve this solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us addresses this problem by establishing a stand-alone grant program within the Department of Homeland Security devoted to establishing an interoperability framework that local authorities can work from. What is of utmost importance in creating this new grant program is the need to ensure technology neutrality so that the best available solution, whether it be radio, software or IP network-based, can be implemented as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with this in mind, Mr. Speaker, I would like to at this time yield to my colleague, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, to ask if he agrees that the goal and the intent of this legislation is to guarantee that our efforts to fund interoperability solutions are indeed technology neutral. Specifically, the term "equipment" as used in the legislation should not be interpreted to exclude important technology such as software, middleware or network-based IP solutions.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="AVIATION SECURITY--SCREENER TRAINING AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT STRENGTHENED, BUT MORE WORK REMAINS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. King for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today, in fact, in support of most of the efforts that are in this bill because most of the efforts in this bill were things that the Republicans in control of the Congress worked to pass on the House side of the building just in the last 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The most important responsibility of the Federal Government is to protect the American people. House Republicans recognized that and moved to enact important recommendations from the 9/11 Commission during the 109th Congress. We enacted, I believe, 39 of those 41 recommendations. And I would suggest to my colleagues that there is probably a reason we didn't enact the other two, because we didn't think they were the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the fact that we have already taken this action before in the House by overwhelming majorities, the bill on the floor today has bypassed the committee process. There has been no opportunity to offer amendments. And, in fact, I want to talk in a minute about one new and I think particularly bad idea. These ideas are proposed in a way that talks about putting risk-based funding in place when, in fact, every single Democrat failed to support an almost identical initiative in the 109th Congress.  That initiative passed in the 109th Congress. And amazingly, this initiative starts when that one ended. I am puzzled by what was so wrong with that initiative in the 109th Congress, now in the 110th Congress. It is an initiative that just simply takes up where the bill we passed last year left off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We can't prevent terror attacks in this country by adding other layers of bureaucracy. We can't prevent terror attacks by making public information about our intelligence budget and other budgets that shouldn't be made public. Homeland security is too important to play politics when American lives are at stake. As a body, both Democrats and Republicans, we need to be committed to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have an enemy that has vowed to exploit every weakness, every piece of needless information we give them, every failure we have to understand the kind of fight that we are in, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also in this legislation today, there is a sense of Congress that the Proliferation Security Initiative initiated by the President in 2003 would need to be somehow authorized by the United Nations. I think that doesn't make sense for this Congress. I don't believe that will ever be in any legislation that makes it to the President's desk. I think it is a particularly bad idea to suggest that our initiatives for proliferation security would somehow now come under the auspices of the United Nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has been a successful program. We have 14 direct partners in this program; over 70 countries have worked with us to follow-up on specific pieces of information that we needed to check into to be sure that proliferation was not a problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hope that the House votes later today to eliminate that sense of the Congress that the United Nations would authorize this program from this legislation. I look forward to bringing this issue to the floor as the majority has promised with debate in the future. We didn't have committee debate on this bill today. I hope that we quickly get to the promises of the majority to debate these bills in committee, bring them to the floor, and work together to do the right thing for the American  people.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the bill, and I want to thank the chairman for your important work on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very pleased that one of the first acts of the Democratic Congress is to finally enact the long overdue recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill contains language I first proposed in the 108th Congress to create a dedicated grant program for emergency communications, which the Republican-controlled Congress rejected at least five times, including in stand-alone amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Communications failures that forced first responders to use runners to relay messages on September 11 and following Hurricane Katrina more closely resemble the time of Paul Revere than the technology available in 2007. The post-September 11 world demands 21st-century preparedness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us have long recognized that we are not prepared to respond to the next emergency until our first responders can communicate with one another. The legislation addresses this massive gap in our Nation's communications capabilities and will improve safety for hundreds of thousands of first responders who protect our communities each day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the interoperability provisions, I am very pleased that this bill includes my proposals to fix the flawed grant funding formula, improve airport screening by providing important rights for screeners, and overhauls the troubled National Asset Database.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge your support for this vital piece of legislation that includes long-overdue improvements for first responders. I thank the gentleman again for his leadership, and I look forward to working together with the people on the other side of the aisle to get this done.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I say this not in anger but in sadness about the missing bipartisanship here by the way this was  brought to the floor. If there was any committee in the last Congress that worked harder on bipartisanship than our committee, I don't know what it was. We worked very closely with the new chairman of the full committee on so many things. We were cosponsors together on the chemical security bill, the port security bill. We managed to have a 29-0  vote in committee after many, many different committee hearings, consultation with the Democratic side as well as the Republican side. And we passed it out 29-0 and passed it off the floor 421-2.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in response to that, we have presented to us this bill which is basically take it or leave it. That's not the way to do these sorts of things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They say we have already dealt with these things. By my count, over 12 percent of the membership of this House has never been here before. So maybe they don't count. Maybe they ought not to have the opportunity to consider these things. It doesn't seem to me that is the way we ought to be doing things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everybody is talking about the 9/11 Commission. What is the biggest thing that we haven't done with the 9/11 Commission which the commissioners have pointed out? We haven't consolidated jurisdiction in this House for homeland security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we started to on our side, and I admit we didn't do everything we ought to have done. When is the greatest opportunity, the golden opportunity you have to do it? When your party takes over, when you don't have any chairmen. Everybody is looking to be a chairperson for the first time. That is when you can do it. You have lost the golden opportunity to do what the 9/11 Commission said was the greatest thing we hadn't done in following their recommendations, and it isn't done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then we have in here 100 percent screening of ocean-going and aviation cargo. Instead of doing it smartly and instead of doing it efficiently, instead of doing it effectively, instead of doing it successfully, instead of using that which we have better than any place in the world, both intelligence gathering and the use of technology, and apply it with sophisticated algorithms, we say we want to cover everything.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I include for the RECORD three letters of support for this bill from the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, and the National Association of Police Organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ORGANIZATIONS, INC.,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, January 8, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON: On behalf of the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO) representing more than 238,000 law enforcement officers throughout the United States, I would like to thank you for introducing <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, the "Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007," and advise you of our support, particularly in regards to Subtitles A and B under Title VII of the legislation. If enacted, this bill will establish a Fusion and Law Enforcement Education and  Teaming (FLEET) grant program, as well as a Border Intelligence Fusion Center program to assist state and local law enforcement in protecting our nation's borders from terrorist and related criminal activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation recognizes the importance of consistent coordination and communication between the country's local, state, and federal law enforcement in preventing acts of terrorism within the United States. The creation of the FLEET and the Border Intelligence Fusion Center programs will help ensure that state and local law enforcement in border regions are properly supported, trained and informed in order to prevent terrorism before it occurs. Most importantly, these provisions will allow  law enforcement agencies to maximize their participation in the fusion centers by providing funds to allow them to assign officers and intelligence analysts to the centers without having to reduce daily neighborhood crime protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NAPO believes that homeland security funding greatly assists local law enforcement. However, we also believe that the continuation and full funding of the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program and Byrne-Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program is imperative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The "Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007" ensures that state and local first responders along our nation's borders are properly supported, trained and equipped to prevent terrorism before it occurs. I thank you for your continued support of law enforcement. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me, or NAPO's Legislative Assistant, Andrea Mournighan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>William J. Johnson,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHIEFS OF POLICE,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alexandria, VA, January 8, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON: On behalf of the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), I am writing to express our strong support for the proposed Fusion and Law Enforcement Education and Teaming (FLEET) Grant Program and the Border Intelligence Fusion Center Program that are contained in <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007. The IACP believes that the adoption of these two provisions would represent a major step forward in enabling the law enforcement  community to better detect, disrupt, and prevent future acts of terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These provisions reflect the reality that while planning, conducting surveillance, or securing the resources necessary to mount their attacks, terrorists often live in our communities, travel on our highways, and shop in our stores. As we discovered in the aftermath of September 11th, several of the terrorists involved in those attacks had routine encounters with state and local law enforcement officials in the weeks and months before the attack. If state, tribal, and local law enforcement officers  are adequately equipped and trained and fully integrated into an information and intelligence sharing network, they can be invaluable assets in efforts to identify and apprehend suspected terrorists before they strike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These two provisions emphasize the vital role that state, local, and tribal law enforcement must play in the development and dissemination of critical intelligence in order to detect, prevent, prepare for, and respond to acts of terrorism. It is IACP's belief that they will also help ensure that law enforcement agencies at all levels of government are equal partners, and that the experience and capabilities of all parties are realized, by allowing state, local, and tribal law enforcement to participate  more actively in the intelligence gathering and sharing process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for continuing support of our nation's law enforcement community. The IACP stands ready to assist in any way possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joseph C. Carter,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NATIONAL SHERIFFS' ASSOCIATION,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alexandria, Virginia, January 8, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON: On behalf of the National Sheriffs' Association (NSA), I write to you to express our strong support for the provisions contained under Title VII of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, "Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007," that would establish Fusion and Law Enforcement Education and Teaming (FLEET) Grant Program and the Border Intelligence Fusion Center Program. NSA believes that the FLEET and Border Intelligence Fusion Center programs would provide the necessary  resources and framework for integration to greatly enhance holistic and geographic approaches in homeland security intelligence and infonnation gathering and sharing between federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, our position is contingent upon amending the definition of "local law enforcement agency or department" in Title VII, Subtitle A of the bill--to include all sheriffs' office across the country rather than just those "sheriffs office in communities where there is no police department" to ensure that sheriffs' offices where police department is present are not excluded from grant eligibility under the FLEET Grant Program. As you may be aware, a sheriff is the chief law enforcement  officer in their respective county and have jurisdiction over all cities within that county. Thus, we respectfully request that the language of the bill be amended to appropriately reflect and recognize the proper authority of the office of sheriff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the voice of 3,087 elected sheriffs across the country and the largest association of law enforcement professionals in the nation, the communication and integration of federal homeland security efforts with state and local fusion centers is an important priority for NSA. Since the events of September 11, the significance of how local law enforcement information might protect national security and the importance of homeland security intelligence and information gathering and sharing have increased  substantially. As recognized by your committee, homeland security intelligence and information pertains not only to terrorist intentions and capabilities to attack people and infrastructure within the United States but also to U.S. abilities to detect, prevent, prepare for and respond to potential terrorist attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sheriffs and their deputies play a critical role in homeland security intelligence and information efforts as the nation's counterterrorism "eyes and ears." Local law enforcement personnel will almost always be the first to experience first hand suspicious activities and first to respond to any terrorist event. Clearly, there is a national intelligence role for state and local law enforcement in which they make contributions  to preventing attacks  or other inimical acts directed against the United States. NSA believes that the proposed programs would facilitate change in the organizational culture barrier thereby establishing state and local law enforcement entities as equal partners in homeland security intelligence efforts. Moreover, these programs would help build an integrated intelligence capability to address threats to the homeland, consistent with U.S. laws and the protection of privacy and civil liberties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sheriffs across the nation share a common counterterrorism interest. The proliferation of intelligence and fusion centers across the country reflect the importance and the value to gathering and sharing information that assists local law enforcement agencies in preventing and responding to local manifestations of threats to their community. We want to thank you for your efforts in addressing this important issue and look forward to working with you to ensure the enactment of these provisions  as well as other proposed initiatives in your "LEAP: A Law Enforcement Assistance and Partnership Strategy" report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sheriff Ted Kamatchus,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on our side of the aisle the Democrats over the last 3 years have identified some gaping holes in our Nation's security, even in aviation where we have spent the most money. You can do it in two ways: you can have state-of-the-art equipment and not a lot of people, or a lot of people and not very good equipment, or a mix of the two.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republicans have chosen to do neither. They haven't been willing to buy the equipment we need: state-of-the-art explosives detection equipment at passenger checkpoints. They haven't been willing to invest in the inline screening for baggage, and they put a totally arbitrary cap on the number of screeners. There are gaping holes. We are going to plug those. A quarter of a billion dollars for explosives screening at passenger checkpoints, a known threat. A billion dollars for inline screening  which the Republicans have refused to fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 4 years, airports across America have begged for inline screening grants. None have been forthcoming from the Republicans. They are saying they have taken care of everything in such a great bipartisan way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now my friend from Florida got up and waxed poetic about San Francisco and said it was due to two things: private screeners and inline screening. Well, the inline equipment I agree with him, and we are going to fund it, unlike the majority. We will install it in every airport in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I disagree on the privatized screening because actually it turns out now that the private screeners at San Francisco were tipped off before the inspectors came through. They don't do any better, and maybe would do worse without those tips, than our public employees. We are going to give them the tools they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On containers, Assistant Secretary Michael Jackson said they want to screen every container before they leave a U.S. port for the interior. Why? Because they might contain threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we said, What does that make our ports, a sacrifice zone if they have a nuclear weapon contained in them?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want to screen containers on the other side of the ocean. Now we hear people on that side get up and say hundreds of billions of dollars to screen these containers. Actually, it is 30 to $50 per container. There are 11 million containers. That is somewhere between 300 and $500 million a year, paid for by a modest fee on the shippers, not by the taxpayers of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to make America more secure. We are going to plug the holes you left in our security and fix the problem.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Gillibrand), a new Member of Congress.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412223" topic="INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Thompson for this opportunity to address this crucial issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that the 110th Congress has put homeland security as its highest priority and will ensure that our country will finally get the security investment it needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, the 9/11 Commission provided us with a nonpartisan assessment of our current state of readiness. And while a few of their recommendations have been enacted, this administration and the previous congressional leadership did not make these recommendations a funding priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we will pass today addresses many of the concerns of the 9/11 Commission, including one of the biggest for New York State, which is port security. Two of the busiest ports in the world, both in Hong Kong, already scan 100 percent of their cargo containers. There is no reason that all ships destined for the United States shouldn't be held to the same standard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we are voting on today gives the largest ports in the world 3 years to implement a system to scan for radiation and density on all containers coming into this country. This impacts my district, in particular, because my district geographically surrounds the port of Albany. If a container with radioactive materials came up the Hudson River from New York City and was unloaded in Albany, it would devastate our entire region. Such a risk will be addressed by this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is also important to me as a mother and to all parents in my district and in our Nation. Every time we travel by airplane and bring our children, we are concerned about safety. This bill will allow parents and grandparents to know that our children will be safer when we travel by plane by requiring 100 percent of air cargo to be scanned by the end of 2009, as well as providing funding for anti-bomb detection for bags and passengers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased that this bill reflects the fact that our first responders are indeed "first preventers." As we all remember, on 9/11 many firemen and police officers gave up their lives because they couldn't communicate. Up until now, we have not yet invested sufficiently to improve such communication capabilities. This bill will do just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I am very pleased that this bill includes investments against terrorist attacks by securing nuclear materials from the former Soviet Union. If you ask any terrorist expert in the world, they will tell you this is their gravest concern. And, finally, I am extremely pleased this funding will be based on risk. For New York State, that means increased funding for my State, including my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Congress must always make the safety of the American people its number one concern. I am confident this bill will do just that.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), a member of the Homeland Security Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400253" topic="INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this bill there are two provisions which have been blocked for 4 years by the White House and by Republican leadership. They are going to be included in this bill and passed this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One is to require that all cargo which is placed on passenger planes in the United States is screened so that there is no bomb, there is nothing that can lead to a catastrophic event in the air, does in fact pass through security. This is a huge change. Each of us has our bags screened, our shoes screened; but the cargo on that same plane placed next to our bags is not screened. This bill will make that possible. I have been working with Mr. Shays from Connecticut on this for the last  4 years. Today is a historic day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, there is an amendment in this bill which will ensure the screening of all ships, all cargo overseas before it departs for the United States to determine whether or not there is a nuclear bomb on that plane. We know that is al Qaeda's highest objective: to obtain a nuclear weapon from the former Soviet Union or from some other rogue state, to then transport it to a port somewhere around the world, put it on a ship and bring it to a port in the United States. When it is in the port of  New York or Boston or Long Beach, it is already too late.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The bomb will be detonated by remote on the ship, causing the catastrophic event, not as the cargo is being taken off. So this amendment requires the screening of all that cargo overseas. This is long overdue. It is al Qaeda's dream to have a nuclear explosion in a major American city, and now, finally, today we do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to compliment Mr. Nadler on all of his work over the years on this  issue, for his leadership. I thank the chairman, the ranking member, Mr. King, for all of their courtesies over the last several years.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400660" topic="INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last year as chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, I oversaw many of the committee's accomplishments in addressing recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Among them were the successful passage of the 21st Century Emergency Communications Bill, the Faster, Smarter Funding Act, and comprehensive bipartisan FEMA reform legislation. My subcommittee, as well as the entire Homeland Security Committee, was successful last year because of our willingness  and ability to work across the aisle to find solutions to problems. As a result, I am disappointed in the way that <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> is coming before the House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remain a strong supporter of certain aspects of this legislation, such as the language that makes first responder funding risk-based. Unfortunately, I have many concerns about other language included in this bill and believe that <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> would be better public policy had the bill been considered in committee and a rule allowed for an open amendment process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation, Mr. Speaker, includes a new grant program that is intended to make grants to local law enforcement to pay personnel costs of officers serving in intelligence fusion centers. As a former sheriff of a major metropolitan county encompassing the City of Seattle, I certainly agree with and understand the need for this authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of my major goals in Congress is to continue to fund local law enforcement as their responsibility grows and grows to protect this homeland. So I support the direction of the this bill. However, as it is written, the language in this bill is unclear as to whether or not it may not apply to all police agencies, all Sheriff's departments, across the country. This problem could have been resolved if we had a bipartisan bill, and I would have been glad to work with my friends across the aisle  on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I have grave concerns for section 408, which includes the TSA personnel management provision. This provision removes the flexibility of TSA to move employees where they are needed most. This provision was not a 9/11 Commission recommendation and has no place in a bill that is described as enacting those recommendations. Including this provision without hearings or examining its potential impact is irresponsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last summer, during the U.K. liquid explosives scare, the Department of Homeland Security was able to retrain and rapidly deploy TSA officers to address this new threat. Section 408 of this legislation would remove that authority. This provision warrants a full debate in committee and also on the House floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Murtha, thank you for your leadership. It is good to see you in the Speaker's Chair. Let me thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Thompson, for his vision and his leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Very quickly, let me remind my colleagues of the tragic incident where we saw the massive loss of life on September 11, 2001. Today we stand on the floor in 2007 finishing the work that was not done by this part Republican Congress since 2001. So I applaud the leadership of this committee for moving forward on responding to the tragedy that changed the lives of so many Americans and those who are still suffering because of the deaths of their loved ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important step and an important day, and I quickly acknowledge the fact that we will now have 100 percent scanning of containers bound for the United States. We will have the effectiveness of making sure that the best technology will be used; and also we will tell America that all of the critical infrastructure will be updated and current so we will know those most vulnerable assets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, we will have for the first time a transportation security planning strategy, and I compliment the gentleman from Mississippi whose bill authored in the last session establishes the importance of having a strategy for transportation security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Need I remind you of the recent incident with the Metro here in Washington, D.C. Although it was labeled as an accident, we know that the transportation system of America is enormously vulnerable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful that we have now a Civil Liberties and Privacy Board that has been languishing in the White House, but now it is under the jurisdiction of the United States Congress. And, yes, the work I have done in the past on anti-smuggling legislation was reaffirmed by the restrictions on terrorists freely traveling without real protection against this danger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good bill. It is long overdue, and I ask my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, September 11, 2001, is a day that is indelibly etched in the psyche of every American and most of the world. Much like the unprovoked attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, September 11, is a day that will live in infamy. And as much as Pearl Harbor changed the course of world history by precipitating the global struggle between totalitarian fascism and representative democracy, the transformative impact of September 11 in the course of American and human history is indelible.  September 11 was not only the beginning of the Global War on Terror, but moreover, it was the day of innocence lost for a new generation of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just like my fellow Americans, I remember September 11 as vividly as if it was yesterday. In my mind's eye, I can still remember being mesmerized by the television as the two airliners crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, and I remember the sense of terror we experienced when we realized that this was no accident, that we had been attacked, and that the world as we know it had changed forever. The moment in which the Twin Towers collapsed and the nearly 3,000 innocent Americans  died haunts me until this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this moment, I decided that the protection of our homeland would be at the forefront of my legislative agenda. I knew that all of our collective efforts as Americans would all be in vain if we did not achieve our most important priority: the security of our Nation. Accordingly, I became then and continue to this day to be an active and engaged Member of the Committee on Homeland Security who considers our national security paramount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's collective response to the tragedy of September 11 exemplified what has been true of the American people since the inception of our Republic--in times of crisis, we come together and always persevere. Despite the depths of our anguish on the preceding day, on September 12, the American people demonstrated their compassion and solidarity for one another as we began the process of response, recovery, and rebuilding. We transcended our differences and came together to honor the sacrifices  and losses sustained by the countless victims of September 11. Let us honor their sacrifices by implementing the bipartisan recommendations of the 9/11 Commission in order to ensure that the tragedy of 9/11 is never repeated. Let us learn from the lessons offered by our history so that we are not destined to repeat them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I wish to pay tribute to the distinguished chair of the Homeland Security Committee, the gentleman from Mississippi, Bennie Thompson. Under Mr. Thompson's visionary leadership, the Democrats on the Committee have performed yeoman service in developing a framework needed to protect the homeland. Unlike the previous Republican leadership, we Democrats embrace wholeheartedly the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, a body comprised of ten of the most distinguished  citizens in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to talk about several of the key provisions of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, the bill implementing the bipartisan 9/11 Commission's recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The importance of providing risk-based allocation of Homeland Security grants cannot be overemphasized. Last December, the 9/11 Commissioners gave an "F" grade to the Administration and Congress on providing risk-based homeland security funding. This bill would substantially increase the share of homeland security grants that are provided to States based on risk, rather than population. Under the bill, a Department of Homeland Security risk assessment would determine each state's funding and  most states would be guaranteed a minimum of 0.25 percent. The bill would provide for a larger minimum (0.45 percent) for states that have a significant international land border and/or adjoin a body of water within North America that contains an international boundary line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last December, the 9/11 Commissioners also gave an "F" grade to the Administration and Congress on communications interoperability for first responders. This bill would improve the communications capabilities of first responders by establishing a stand-alone communications interoperability grant program at the Department of Homeland Security to provide first responders with the type of equipment that allows them to communicate with one another during emergencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commissioners gave a "D" grade to the Administration and Congress for their efforts on enhancing air cargo screening. This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish a system for inspecting 100 percent of cargo carried on passenger aircraft over the next 3 years. The bill directs DHS to develop a phased-in approach so that by the end of FY 2007, 35 percent of this cargo is inspected; by the end of FY 2008, 65 percent is inspected; and by the end of FY 2009,  100 percent is inspected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commissioners also gave a "D" grade to the Administration and Congress on improving the security of checked baggage. This bill continues the dedication of $250 million per</paragraph>
    <paragraph>year currently collected in airport security fees from the Aviation Security Capital Fund for the installation of in-line explosive detection systems for checked baggage at our Nation's airports for fiscal years 2008 through 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commissioners gave a "C" grade to the Administration and Congress on improving airline passenger screening checkpoints to detect explosives. This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to issue a strategic plan for the deployment of explosive detection equipment at passenger checkpoints that is long overdue. The bill also provides new funding in order to make rapid improvements to security measures at passenger checkpoints.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill goes beyond the 9/11 Commission's recommendations by including provisions that would phase in a requirement for 100 percent scanning of cargo containers bound for the United States. This provision would require that 100 percent of cargo containers be scanned and sealed using the best available technology before being loaded onto ships destined for the United States. The containers must be scanned by both X-ray machines and radiation detectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Large ports would be given 3 years to comply and smaller ports 5 years. (Two of the busiest port terminals in the world--in Hong Kong--already scan 100 percent of cargo containers). The Port of Houston represents a substantial source of vulnerability. The Port is the world's sixth largest seaport and the Nation's largest oil port; and for the past 8 years, it has led the Nation in the amount of foreign tonnage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commissioners gave a "D" grade to the Administration and Congress for their efforts on critical infrastructure assessment. This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to conduct an annual vulnerability assessment for all critical infrastructure sectors. It also requires DHS to annually update the National Asset Database to ensure that it is a current list of national assets and critical infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commissioners gave a "C-" grade to the Administration and Congress on the National Strategy for Transportation Security, arguing that it was too vague to be useful. This bill requires improvements in the National Strategy for Transportation Security, such as by requiring DHS to develop risk-based priorities for transportation security initiatives based on vulnerability assessments conducted by the Department. It also requires DHS to develop a Strategic Information Sharing Plan for  transportation in order to significantly improve the sharing of security information with all transportation stakeholders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I introduced the Security Plans and Training for Rail and Mass Transit Systems Amendment to <bill type="h" number="4439">H.R. 4439</bill> on March 9, 2006. This amendment, which mandated security plans and training for rail and mass transit systems, was adopted by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commissioners gave a "D" grade on government information sharing. This bill contains several provisions to strengthen intelligence and information sharing with local law enforcement. First, it strengthens state and local intelligence "fusion" centers, which have been established to gather, analyze and disseminate potentially homeland security-relevant information to appropriate state and local officials. Second, it strengthens the presence of federal agencies, such as the Border  Patrol, at fusion centers in border states. Thirdly, it improves the Department of Homeland Security's Information Sharing Programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commissioners gave an "Incomplete" grade on preventing terrorist travel. This bill improves the capabilities of the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center by authorizing additional funding to stem human smuggling, human trafficking, and terrorism travel, including requiring the hiring of experienced intelligence analysts in the field of human trafficking and terrorist travel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During my tenure as the ranking member of the Immigration and Claims Subcommittee in the Judiciary Committee, I have stressed that alien smuggling will not stop until we establish an immigration policy that substantially reduces the need for illegal entry into the United States. In the meantime, our highest priority should be to do what we can to reduce the deaths from reckless, help in achieving that objective, the Commercial Alien Smuggling Elimination Act (The CASE Act). It would do this by  establishing an informant program which has been designed to facilitate the investigation and prosecution, or disruption, of reckless commercial smuggling operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the CASE Act would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and implement an outreach program to educate the public here and abroad about the penalties for smuggling aliens. It also would provide information about the financial rewards and the immigration benefits that would be available for assisting in the investigation, disruption, or prosecution of a commercial alien smuggling operation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee defeated (11 to 16) my amendment (No. 16) to the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2006. This amendment required the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to  secure the land borders, based on threat and vulnerability assessments of our ports-of-entry and the vast stretches of land between them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My Rapid Response Border Protection Act:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increases in CBP Inspectors, Funding for Essential Equipment, Foreign Language Training, and Incentives to Improve Morale (offered by Ms. JACKSON-LEE, <bill type="h" number="4312">H.R. 4312</bill>, Nov. 16, 2005).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Committee on Homeland Security defeated (12 to 15) the Jackson- (1H) to <bill type="h" number="4312">H.R. 4312</bill>, the Border Security and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2005. This amendment provided:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Funding to hire and train an additional 2,000 inspectors and Border Patrol agents each year, beginning with $375 million for Fiscal Year 2006; $692 million in Fiscal Year 2007; $1.008 billion in Fiscal Year 2008; $1.324 billion in Fiscal Year 2009; and $1.641 billion in Fiscal Year 2010. These numbers are identical to those authorized in the 9/11 Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Funding to provide agents with radios, night-vision equipment, and weapons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Enhanced foreign language training for border agents and inspectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Incentives to improve the morale of border inspectors, including new student loan payments and retirement incentives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commissioners gave a "D" to the Administration and Congress on preventing the proliferation of WMD and terrorism. This bill includes numerous provisions to address this issue, including: strengthening DOD's Cooperative Threat Reduction (or "Nunn-Lugar") program that focuses on nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union; strengthening the Energy Department's Global Threat Reduction Initiative; providing for reforms, increased tools and greater oversight over the Proliferation Security  Initiative, through which the United  States and participating countries interdict WMD; establishing a U.S. Coordinator for the Prevention of WMD Proliferation and Terrorism, who would serve as an advisor to the President on all WMD proliferation</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill includes "The Nuclear Black Market Counter-Terrorism Act," which requires the President to impose sanctions on any foreign person who trades nuclear enrichment technology to a non-nuclear weapons state or provides items that contribute to the development of a nuclear weapon by a non-nuclear weapons state or any foreign person. Sanctions include prohibiting foreign assistance to such person; prohibiting the export of defense articles, defense services, or dual use items; and prohibiting  contracts. These provisions also provide that U.S. assistance should only be provided to countries that are not cooperating with countries or individuals who are engaged in, planning or assisting any terrorist group in the development of nuclear weapons; and to countries that are completely cooperating with the U.S. in its efforts to eliminate nuclear black-market networks. This title also includes enhanced oversight over U.S. efforts to break up nuclear black markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commissioners gave a "D" grade regarding increasing secular educational opportunities in Muslim countries. This bill would significantly enhance the International Arab and Muslim Youth Opportunity Fund, which is designed to improve educational opportunities for these youth, by calling for greater funding and outlining specific purposes for the fund. Under the bill, the fund would be used for such purposes as enhancing modem educational programs; funding training and exchange programs  for teachers, administrators, and students; and providing other types of assistance such as the translation of foreign books, newspapers and other reading materials into local languages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would authorize the Secretary of State to designate an appropriate private, non-profit U.S. organization as the Middle East Foundation and to provide funding for the foundation through the Middle East Partnership Initiative. The purpose of this foundation would be to support, in the countries of the Middle East, the expansion of civil society; opportunities for political participation of all citizens; protections for internationally recognized human rights; reforms in education; independent  media; policies that promote economic opportunities for all citizens; the rule of law; and democratic processes of government. It also requires the Secretary to develop 5-year strategies on fostering human rights and democracy in order to require a long- term approach to the promotion of democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commissioners gave a "C" grade for providing a clear U.S. message abroad. This bill calls for the U.S. to improve its communication of ideas and information to people in countries with significant Muslim populations, for U.S. public diplomacy to reaffirm U.S. commitment to democratic principles, and for a significant expansion of U.S. international broadcasting that is  targeted to countries with significant Muslim populations. The measure also provides for "surge" authority to allow the Broadcasting Board of Governors to better address emerging situations and opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commissioners gave a "D" grade regarding expanding U.S. scholarship, exchange and library programs in Muslim countries. This bill requires the Secretary of State to prepare a report on the 9/11 Commission's recommendations on these U.S. scholarship, exchange and library programs, including a certification by the Secretary that such recommendations have been implemented, or if a certification cannot be made, what steps have been taken to implement such recommendations. The bill also  requires the GAG to review the government's efforts in this area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commission recommended that the U.S. develop a common coalition approach on standards for terrorist detention. Last December, the 9/11 Commissioners then gave the Administration and Congress an "F" grade for failing to do so. This bill requires the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General, to submit to Congress a report on progress being made to develop such an approach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commissioners gave a "D" grade to the Administration and Congress on promoting reform in Saudi Arabia. This bill calls for the U.S. to engage Saudi Arabia on openly confronting the issue of terrorism; to enhance counterterrorism cooperation with Saudi Arabia; and to support Saudi Arabia's efforts to make political, economic, and social reforms throughout the country. The measure also requires the President to report on whether the Administration's "Strategic Dialogue" with Saudi  Arabia is meeting these objectives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commissioners gave a "C+" grade on supporting Pakistan against extremists. This bill requires the President to submit a report to Congress on the long-term U.S. strategy to engage with the Government of Pakistan to address curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons technology; combating poverty and corruption; promoting democracy and the rule of law; and effectively dealing with Islamic extremism. The measure also requires a certification that Pakistan is addressing the continued  presence of the Taliban and other violent extremist forces throughout the country as a condition of continued assistance. In addition, it extends the waiver of sanctions on Pakistan because of its military coup until after Pakistan's parliamentary elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill calls for the U.S. to maintain its long-term commitment to Afghanistan by increased assistance and the continued deployment of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. It also calls for the President to engage aggressively with the Government of Afghanistan and NATO to explore all options for addressing the narcotics crisis in Afghanistan. It also directs the President to make every effort to dramatically increase the numbers of U.S. and international police trainers, mentors and police personnel  operating with Afghan civil security forces; and to address current short-term shortages of energy in Afghanistan, in order to ensure the delivery of electricity to Afghanis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as I stand here today, my heart still grieves for those who perished on flights United Airlines 93, American Airlines 77, American Airlines 11, and United Airlines 175. When the sun rose on the morning of September 11, none of us knew that it would end in an inferno in the magnificent World Trade Center Towers in New York City, the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and in the grassy fields of Shanksville, Pennsylvania. How I wish we could have hugged and kissed and held each of the  victims one last time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand here remembering those who still suffer, whose hearts still ache over the loss of so many innocent and interrupted lives. My prayer is that for those who lost a father, a mother, a husband, a wife, a child, or a friend will in the days and years ahead take comfort in the certain knowledge that they have gone on to claim the greatest prize, a place in the Lord's loving arms. And down here on the ground, their memory will never die so long as any of the many of us who loved them lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the best way to honor the memory of those lost in the inferno of 9/11, is to do all we can to ensure that it never happens again. The way to do that is to pass <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> and implement the 9/11 Commission's recommendations.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400381" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, section 621 of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> requires the Department of Homeland Security to report to Congress how it plans to implement an automated biometric entry-and-exit data system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A decade ago, Senator Alan Simpson and I authored the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 which required the Federal Government to develop such an automated entry-and-exit system. This would enable us to know who is entering the United States and when they leave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Forty percent of all illegal immigrants come to the United States legally but overstay their temporary visas. We can never begin to solve the illegal immigration problem if we don't deal with overstays, and we can never deal with overstays until we have a functioning exit control system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of mandating completion of the exit component of a U.S. visit, this bill simply requires that the administration submit a report, a report already required by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The failure to fully implement an  exit control system is more evidence that it will be a long time before our country has secure borders. Instead of helping to change that, this bill only requires a report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that we have missed an opportunity to better secure our homeland.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2  minutes to the gentlelady from California (Ms. Loretta Sanchez).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400356" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and it feels great to call you Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, the Implementing the 9/11 Recommendations Act of 2007, and as a Member who has been on the Homeland Security Committee since its inception and a ranking member on one of its major committees, I am really thrilled that we are bringing this legislation on the real first day of legislative business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some really essential things in this. One major thing would be to achieve real security by implementing and distributing most homeland security grant funding on the basis of risk. After the Department of Homeland Security's completion of a comprehensive risk assessment, States with lower risks will be guaranteed 25 percent funding, or 45 percent if that State has an international land or sea border. This is important because, as we know, there are many States that need that money, and  they need it now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another important provision of this will be the infrastructure database, one that I have been talking about for the last 4 years and trying to get together. Let's just get that done. These requirements would satisfy the 9/11 Commission recommendation for the development of a reliable and complete list of the Nation's critical infrastructure to be used so we can help to assess the threats and allocate the limited resources that we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, I am particularly pleased we are going to have an Office of Appeals and Redress. This is something that I offered as an amendment in committee which is included in this legislation so that people who are on the terrorist list have some way to get off if they are innocent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, the Implementing the 9/11 Recommendations Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last several Congresses, my work as the ranking member of the Economic Security, Infrastructure Security and Cyber Security Subcommittee of the Homeland Security Committee has focused on the threats to our Nation's security and how we can best protect ourselves from those threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is an essential step towards achieving real security by implementing outstanding 9/11 Commission recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One major security enhancement in this legislation is the move to distribute most homeland security grant funding on the basis of risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the Department of Homeland Security's completion of comprehensive risk assessments, States with lower risk will be guaranteed 25 percent of all homeland security funding, or 45 percent if the State has an international land or sea border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision strikes an appropriate balance between allocating most of the funding based on risk, while ensuring that every State will have the funding to maintain the necessary level of preparedness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another important provision in this legislation requires annual updates of the National Asset Database, and the creation of a subset, the National At-Risk Database which will list the infrastructure most at risk to terrorist attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the provision requires the Department of Homeland Security to consult each State annually to discuss their assets, and confer with them before removing a State asset from the Database.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These requirements satisfy the 9/11 Commission recommendation for the development of a reliable and complete list of the Nation's critical infrastructure to be used to assess threats and allocate infrastructure protection grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also particularly pleased that a provision to establish an Office of Appeals and Redress that I offered as an amendment in Committee was included in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I drafted this provision in response to my constituents' frustrations when they were held up because they had the same name as someone on the no-fly list, a frustration that I experienced personally several months ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The establishment of this DHS-wide office will ensure a timely and fair process for individuals that are wrongly identified, to seek redress, correct their records and reduce, or end, repeated delays and missed flights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are just a few of the important provisions in <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> that will improve our Nation's security. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400313" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate our colleague's efforts to secure the Nation. We join in that effort. Protecting our homeland requires diligence, resolve and common sense, and I salute my colleagues who drafted the bill. However, since we had no process in committee to discuss or amend the bill, we are simply left with asking rhetorical questions here on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were told earlier that for $30 to $40 per container we were going to secure America. I hold in front of me my passport. I am about to get that renewed. Every 10 years we do that, and it is going to cost $82. I will tell you that we had secure communications, secure briefings in homeland security, how they cannot secure even our passports for $82, yet we are going to secure containers that are coming from the Middle East full of oil; we are going to secure containers full of vegetables; and  we are not going to interrupt commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot even count on some of our friends to protect the intellectual property rights on compact discs, and yet we are going to trust them to offer the security of this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the questions that should have come up in committee. These are the questions that should come up today. These are the questions that are being ignored, and we are being asked to look the other way and declare the Nation safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join with my colleagues in saying it is awfully important for us to make the Nation safe. The way we do that is to prosecute the war on terror, to take the will away from those people who would strike this country, to ensure that intelligence will provide us with the resources and the application of the resources to the areas of greatest threat. We cannot secure containers for $30 apiece when we can't secure the passport for $82.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400230" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend this body for getting us back on track to fully implementing all the recommendations made by the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. The 9/11 Commission provided an objective and eye-opening assessment of how terrorists were able to exploit our security vulnerabilities on September 11 and made 41 key recommendations to address these shortcomings. Unfortunately, 2 1/2  years after the Commission's report, glaring threats still remain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just over a year ago, the 9/11 Discourse Project issued a report card that gave the administration Ds and Fs in some of the most critical areas. Today, we finally have an opportunity to ensure that the 9/11 Commission's tireless efforts were not in vain. <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> would shore up remaining vulnerabilities and implement recommendations that have been ignored completely or have been only partially addressed until now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on the Prevention of Nuclear and Biological Attack in the 109th Congress, I am pleased that this bill makes it more difficult for terrorists to obtain nuclear materials. It strengthens our global nonproliferation programs, which have proven successful in securing the most dangerous nuclear material abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To further protect our homeland from nuclear threats, <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> also requires 100 percent screening of cargo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this legislation will help our first responders, who place their lives on the line each and every day, by funding State and local interoperable communications systems essential for emergency response. <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> also significantly improves information sharing, which is our first line of defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good bill, and I urge passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise as a proud New Yorker and a new member of the Homeland Security Committee in enthusiastic support of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in full support of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, Implementing the 9/11 Commission's Recommendations. As a New Yorker and a member of the Homeland Security Committee, this bill will implement very important recommendations that will ensure countries' citizens are more secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the attacks of September 11, the lives of nearly 400 persons from Brooklyn, New York, came to an abrupt end due to terrorists who used commercial airliners as guided missiles and crashed them into both of the World Trade Center Towers in lower Manhattan. In accordance with the attacks, more innocent lives were lost due to an adequately communication infrastructure. This bill will help to address this shortfall in our first responders' ability to coordinate future rescue efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot think of a better way of honoring the memories, sacrifice and dedication of New York City's first responders: Fire Department of New York--FDNY; Emergency Medical Service--EMS; New York Police Department--NYPD; and the Port Authority Police Department--PAPD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Terrorism is not an Islamic issue or a Muslim issue, it is a human issue. No matter what form or by whom it is perpetrated, terrorism is a direct threat to our civil society. I believe that these recommendations will help restore civility in our world. We must continue to demonstrate that Americans are good people, and overall, we want to help each other. Our diplomatic efforts will become more robust, our presence will be more visible and our day to day activities with our neighbors around the  world, more meaningful. The bill's provisions include requiring major improvements in aviation security, border security, and infrastructure security; providing first responders the equipment and training they need; beefing up efforts to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction; and significantly expanding diplomatic, economic, educational, and other strategies designed to counter terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Overall, Mr. Speaker, I believe the recommendations will help make our nation safer and will limit the likelihood of a similar attack on our country. I fully support this legislation and encourage all of my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I heard all during the fall campaign from the Democratic side of the aisle, the new majority, how they were going to fully implement, fully implement, the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and talk about how the then Republican majority failed miserably, and the 9/11 Commission gave the Republicans failing grades, failing grades for passing 39 out of 41 recommendations by the bipartisan commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Now, when I do the math on that, that is 95 percent. I do not know about your school, Mr. Speaker, but at Georgia Tech, 95 percent was a solid A.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the point I want to make is that in no way, shape, or form is the new majority coming forward with full implementation of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. And I hope the media and I hope the 9/11 families do not give you a pass on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you look at those 41 recommendations, a couple that we were not able to pass, that we did not pass, and I think we probably should have, one of them was especially in regard to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, having that as a balanced committee, almost like the House Committee on Standards of Official Behavior, the ethics committee, where you have an equal balance between the two sides, the commission has called for a one-vote margin, a one-person margin for the majority.  You have structured that committee with a 12-9 majority for the Democrats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, the commission has called for open disclosure, Mr. Speaker, in regard to the funding for intelligence, that every Member of this body should have an opportunity to see what each of 15 agencies, not just the CIA but all those agencies embedded within the Department of Defense and under the control of the Deputy Secretary of Intelligence within the Department, we need to know what that spending is. So let us tell the truth and be honest with the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a little earlier, the distinguished majority leader, who I have great respect for, and I know you have great respect for Mr. Hoyer, said that the Democratic co-Chair of the 9/11 Commission, Mr. Hamilton, said: "If <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> is implemented and fully funded, the American people will be safer." No, duh. But at what cost?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, Mr. Speaker, what the former Republican majority has done in regard to container security initiatives, we screen every container.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412206" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the 9/11 Commission completed their extensive investigation, they reported an inability of the public safety organizations at the local, State, and Federal levels to establish compatible and adequate communications. According to the report, a commitment had to be made to improve the interoperability of emergency communications and capabilities for first responders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With nearly 25 years of law enforcement experience, I understand the essential need for effective emergency communications. When a devastating tornado ripped through my community in November of 2005, our local first responders were equipped to communicate with each other. However, the much-needed help we needed from other agencies was difficult during this time because they were unable to speak to us when they came on the scene.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long Congress has been decidedly ineffective in addressing our country's most pressing security needs. The 9/11 Commission gave Congress an F on ensuring communication interoperability for first responders. We need to rectify this. Congress and the Federal Government can and must do better, and that is why I stand in support and strongly endorse the implementation of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I just want to say to PETER KING, as chairman you ran this committee in such a bipartisan way and worked well with the now-chairman, and I just hope and pray that this continues on a bipartisan basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say as well that I am excited to be back for 2 years to wrestle with the people's business, and these are very important issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As co-chairman of the 9/11 Commission Caucus, I could tell you reasons why you might want to vote against the bill. It does not provide the total amount spent on intelligence. It does not address recommendations to shift covert operations from CIA to defense. It does not create a separate appropriation subcommittee on intelligence. It does not make a select permanent committee a full committee, nor does it address the jurisdictions of the Department of Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could tell you those would be reasons why you could be disappointed. But why you should like this bill is that it deals with expanding risk-based funding, and it deals more with interoperability, which is a huge issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly concerned about screening all cargo on passenger planes within 3 years, and I am happy this bill does that. Cargo screening, I am not sure if it will screen 100 percent of cargo, but I do think it moves us towards doing what we need to do to identify radiation and potential nuclear weapons. I particularly like making the Privacy and Civil Liberties Board an independent agency and giving it subpoena power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are things that I think move the ball forward. I think Republicans did it in the last session, and I think this legislation is a good step forward. So we can find reasons why we may not like it; but I would hope, in the end, on a bipartisan basis, we can recognize that it does a lot more good and therefore deserves our support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank Mr. King for his leadership as chairman, and I welcome our new chairman.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, January 9, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN DINGELL: I appreciate your letter regarding certain aspects of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, the "Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While it is important to note that I do not control the entire process, as there are other House Committees involved and the Senate will likely have its own positions on a variety of these issues, I would be glad to work with you as the legislation moves forward. I agree we should avoid conflicting or inconsistent rules and guidance. As for the specific areas of interest that you raise in your letter, I am pleased to respond to each issue, point by point, as raised in your letter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I would say that it is the my intention that the Secretary of Homeland Security, in developing risk-based funding criteria for first responder programs, coordinate with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Additionally, I am pleased to work with you to ensure that issues regarding the Department of Energy's Megaports program and the cargo scanning requirement contained in the bill are addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Your letter also seeks clarification on the intended impact of the word "except" in section 901 of the bill and how it would relate to activities underway by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In answer to your question, I do agree that the effect of the "except" clause is that there is no requirement that for the Department of Homeland Security to perform vulnerability assessments at drinking water utilities. However, I note that the Department of Homeland Security does use the drinking  water vulnerability assessments conducted under the Safe Drinking Water Act for a number of purposes, and it works with the EPA on these issues. It is not the intention of this legislation to affect that relationship either. Additionally, it is not my intention that the voluntary program</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, with respect to your questions on telecommunications and cybersecurity, I am pleased to work with you on the matters raised and agree that the bill does not attempt in any way to diminish or dilute any authority or resources of the Assistant Secretary for Cyber Security or of other Federal agencies engaged in efforts to secure cyber space. I would note that Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Member of the Homeland Security Committee, was one of the original sponsors of <bill type="h" number="285">H.R. 285</bill>, the bill to create  the Assistant Secretary of Cyber Security, during the 109th Congress. I have been glad to work to create this position, and I agree that is not the intention of the bill to weaken that position. I also do not intend to weaken other federal cyber security efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the cooperation in this manner and look forward to working with you, as this bill moves through the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, January 9, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing to seek clarification on jurisdictional aspects of H.R 1, the "Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007". The bill appears to concern many sectors of the United States economy. These include food safety, chemical safety, energy, electric reliability, nuclear energy, public health and health care, biological threats, telecommunications, the Internet, pipeline safety, safe drinking water, and hydroelectric facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Committee on Energy and Commerce has jurisdiction on statutes that concern these economic sectors and has relevant expertise to offer, I would like assurances that you will continue to work with me in a meaningful manner on these issues as the bill moves forward. I believe that such collaboration will help ensure that the bill does not result in the private sector being subjected to conflicting or inconsistent rules or guidance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to give a few examples of portions of the bill where clarification would be helpful. First, with respect to first responders in emergency situations, Section 101 of the bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish risk-based evaluation and prioritization criteria for Department of Homeland Security grants to first responders. The new Section 2004(a) of the Homeland Security Act created by Section 101 of this bill requires the Secretary, "in establishing criteria  for evaluating and prioritizing applications for covered grants," to "coordinate" with "other Department officials as determined by the Secretary." In developing the criteria, do you intend for the Secretary of Homeland Security to coordinate with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, among other Federal agencies?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As to the scanning of containers at foreign ports, there is a provision in Title V of the bill to require the scanning of 100 percent of containers before they leave foreign ports bound for the United States. The Department of Energy has a "Megaports Initiative" to secure containers at foreign ports. As the scanning requirement contained in the bill may raise a number of issues involving the Department of Energy's Megaports program, will you work with me to ensure that these issues are addressed?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As to environmental matters, Section 901 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to prepare a vulnerability assessment of critical infrastructure "Except where a vulnerability assessment is required under another provision of law." The Safe Drinking Water Act requires drinking water utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and provide them to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for review. Do you agree that the effect of the "except" clause is that there is no requirement  for Homeland Security officials to perform vulnerability assessments at drinking water utilities?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Continuing with environmental matters, Title XI of the bill directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and implement a program to enhance private sector emergency preparedness through the promotion and use of voluntary standards. Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act establishes a regulatory program that concerns accidental releases of hazardous chemicals, and the program requires covered facilities to prepare an emergency response plan. That plan must inform the public and local agencies  as to accidental releases, emergency health care, and employee training measures. Am I correct that you do not intend for the bill's voluntary program to interfere with the mandatory Clean Air Act program?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Turning to energy, I want to work with you to clarify the bill's effect with respect to independent regulatory commissions in the field, such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), as well as the Department of Energy (DOE), which issues health and safety regulations for protection of the public, workers, and the environment. The areas of concern regarding energy include the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(1) The bill's effects on the Energy Reliability Organization recently approved by FERC pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) The bill's effects on conditions established by the NRC on construction and operation licenses required of the Nation's nuclear power plants to ensure their safety and reliability, including their ability to withstand natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes and also potential hostile threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(3) The bill's effects on rules established by the DOE (in concert with other regulatory agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)) with respect to radiological hazards at the Nation's nuclear waste and weapons facilities, including rules relating to worker safety and the protection of public health and the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Will you work with me to clarify these matters?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another area of concern relates to various telecommunication issues. One is improving communications interoperability. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), one of the Executive Branch agencies with communications expertise, administers, in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security's, a billion dollar program to improve interoperable emergency communications. Will you  work with me on these telecommunications  issues?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, there is the issue of cyber security. For example, several Federal agencies have ongoing efforts to improve cyber security. Similarly, the expert on cyber-security within the Department of Homeland Security is the Assistant Secretary for Cyber Security and Telecommunications, as set out in section 242 of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2007. Do you agree that this bill does not attempt in any way to diminish or dilute any authority or resources  of the Assistant Secretary for Cyber Security or of other Federal agencies engaged in efforts to secure cyber space?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate your cooperation. In closing, I note that additional issues may be identified that would benefit from our cooperative efforts. Thank you in advance for considering my concerns and providing the necessary clarification on these matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman,</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400391" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding to me as I rise in support of the <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> legislation to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For far too long, police officers have not been able to communicate directly with firefighters, EMT, and other emergency personnel. This is called interoperability. This lack of the ability to communicate with each other resulted in the deaths of 121 firefighters on September 11 because no one could tell these firefighters to get out of the building before the World Trade Center fell upon them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commission concluded that the inability to communicate was a critical element in the World Trade Center, Pentagon, and Somerset County, Pennsylvania, crash sites. Federal funding of such interagency communication units should be given a high priority, so said the 9/11 Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been down to this floor repeatedly since then trying to increase money for interoperability so we could communicate with each other. Last year, I actually introduced an amendment which asked for $5.8 billion of the $18 billion estimated for this interoperability program, and, unfortunately, my Republican colleagues defeated the amendment on a tie vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at a minimum, we owe our first responders the tools they need to do the jobs they need to do so that they may protect the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, legislation to implement the 9-11 Commission's recommendation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For far too long, police officers have not been able to communicate directly with firefighters or EMT in their own city or just across jurisdictional lines. This lack of the ability to communicate is called interoperability. The lack of interoperability resulted in the deaths of 121 firefighters on September 11th because no one could tell these firefighters that the World Trade Center was about to cave in on them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9-11 Commissioners concluded:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The inability to communicate was a critical element of the World Trade Center, Pentagon, and Somerset County, Pennsylvania, crash sites ..... Federal funding of such (interagency communication) units should be given high priority--9-11 Commission Report</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, the 9-11 Commission gave Congress and the Administration an "F" for failing to address our nation's interoperability problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> would establish a grant program within the Department of Homeland Security dedicated to interoperable communications and require greater accountability at DHS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past, I have offered an amendment to apply $5.8 billion dollars to the new grant program, but my Republican colleagues defeated my amendment on a tie vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans defeated similar Democratic efforts in the Homeland Security Committee. Time and time again, the Republican-led House blocked more funding for interoperable communications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at minimum, we owe our first responders the tools they need to do their jobs to make America safe--our first responders must be able to communicate. Today, Congress is taking steps to provide those tools and ensure we never repeat the mistakes of 9-11.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Corrine Brown).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400048" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it has been almost 3 years since the train bombing in Madrid, almost 2 years since the transit bombing in London, and nearly a year since the commuter rail bombings in Bombay, India; yet the Bush administration has done nothing to protect the Nation's freight and transit rail systems and its millions of passengers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot keep treating our rail infrastructure as second-class citizens. We have dedicated billions of dollars to repair the rail system in Iraq but have done little to invest in the security upgrades needed right here in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another perfect example of falling down on the job is the administration repeatedly zeroing out the Port Security Grant program, which is one of the few sources for a port to improve anti-terrorist measures in their facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passing this bill will be the first step in a long road to protecting the people of this Nation and making sure our communities, our first responders, and our transportation workers are safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In December 2005, the 9/11 Commission gave the administration and Congress five Fs and 12 Ds. An example of one of these F grades is in providing a risk-based allocation of homeland security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage all the Members to vote for this bill.</paragraph>
