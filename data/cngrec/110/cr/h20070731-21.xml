  <narrative>A STRATEGY DESERVING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S SUPPORT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H9188]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400283" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our intelligence agencies have confirmed that America is more vulnerable now than it was 6 years ago before the 9/11 attacks. That is because Osama bin Laden has gained strength, gained recruits and gained experience in the meantime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It didn't have to be that way. We had him cornered and crippled in Tora Bora, but then we outsourced the job of capturing him. Then, to make matters worse, we poured our military and financial resources into Iraq, where al Qaeda was nonexistent, thereby giving Osama bin Laden his most effective recruiting tool.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President keeps referring to al Qaeda in Iraq. It is not the Iraqis who are planning on how to attack America. It is al Qaeda in Waziristan. We need an intelligence strategy to go after bin Laden in Waziristan with our Special Operations working with the tribal chiefs who want to rid themselves of this pest. That is what we need to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, that is the only strategy that is deserving of the sacrifice of our military families. We need leadership that is deserving of the American public's support.</paragraph>
