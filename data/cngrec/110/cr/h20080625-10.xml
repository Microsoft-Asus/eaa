  <narrative>BIG OIL DOESN'T NEED MORE LAND TO DRILL; THEY SHOULD USE IT OR LOSE IT -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6012]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. WILSON of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, with gas prices reaching $4 a gallon and rising, the American people are searching for real relief at the pump. While Washington Republicans continue to advocate for the same failed energy policies that got us where we are today, Democrats are providing American consumers with real solutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must increase drilling. I support a new piece of legislation that says to oil companies: Use it or lose it. Use the leases you have on land where we know there is oil or lose those leases to an oil company that is willing to drill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oil companies that are raking in record profits are currently sitting on 68 million acres of leased oil-rich Federal land that they are not drilling. The amount of oil which could be produced from these reserves would nearly double the total U.S. production. If oil companies drilled those 68 million acres, the U.S. could produce an additional 4.8 million barrels a day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this week, we will have the opportunity to tell Big Oil to either use the leases they have or to lose them.</paragraph>
