  <narrative>SOLUTIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE -- (Senate - May 21, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4614">S4614</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, earlier this spring, I introduced legislation to address the challenge of how to deal with greenhouse gases. The bill is called the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Atmospheric Removal Act, or the GEAR Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of this body have discussed various proposals to regulate the output of greenhouse gases. Some advocate doing it through a cap-and-trade approach. Others have advocated a carbon tax. Such proposals are aimed at limiting future carbon output into the atmosphere. Many proposals have been introduced and debated using this approach of dealing with carbon output.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want to protect our environment and we want a strong economy. The way to have both is by thinking anew and acting anew. It is time to use our untapped human potential and the American spirit to develop the technologies we need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate will soon be debating climate legislation. I believe we should identify solutions through imagination, innovation, and invention, not through limits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope and my goal that the GEAR Act will foster the kind of solutions that we need to address the concerns about climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, there was a very thoughtful editorial which was printed in "Wyoming Agriculture," which is published by the Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The editorial was written by Ken Hamilton. Ken is the executive vice president of the Wyoming Farm Bureau. I believe he does a terrific job of summing up the feelings of Wyoming people on the need to find practical "real" solutions to climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recommend it to my colleagues and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ther being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You Can't Have Your Cake And Eat It Too</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(By Ken Hamilton, WyFB Executive Vice President)</narrative>
  <narrative>One of the first little sayings you probably heard when you were growing up was that you can't have your cake and eat it too. Generally everyone will agree that this is self evident, but that doesn't stop Americans (and probably people in other countries) from always trying to have it both ways.</narrative>
  <narrative>This is never more evident than the actions surrounding global warming. We are continually being bombarded by pronouncements about man caused global warming (it's hovering around 4 degrees with a 25 mph breeze blowing as I write this). When I was discussing this global warming issue with a friend, he said what people need to do is stop arguing with the activists over whether there is man caused global warming and start asking them what their solutions are going to be.</narrative>
  <narrative>The more I thought about it the more I realized the whole global warming debate is absent any discussion of real solutions. We hear vague pronouncements about a greenhouse gas tax, but not much else. And none have enough details to fully analyze what the impact will be on people. There are numerous shows on television where people are talking about reducing their "carbon footprint", but most of these solutions revolve around still living the lifestyle you want while feeling good about using  a material someone has pronounced as "green."</narrative>
  <narrative>For instance, one of the new "green" materials for flooring in houses now is bamboo. Why someone feels this is greener than oak or pine is beyond me, but nevertheless apparently it is. The interesting thing is that while everyone is talking green, they are busy building a house that's twice the square footage of a generation ago. Our grandparents lived in a house where one or two rooms had heat part of the time. In today's modern homes there is heat running to every room, plus a television  set in half of them, a minimum two-car garage (heated of course) and appliances that grandma couldn't even dream about. All of these, of course have some "green" marketing gimmick attached to them, so, you guessed it, people can live in even bigger houses while feeling good about doing their part.</narrative>
  <narrative>But if meaningful curbs in greenhouse gases must occur as they profess, then there shouldn't be houses with two-car garages. You don't find those sorts of things in third world countries where the people's carbon footprint is less than here. Dishwashers must go as well as washing machines, dryers, and central heating. In third world countries where they don't have such a big carbon footprint, health clubs are not needed, nor are double ovens.</narrative>
  <narrative>Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is in a panic over global warming, should stop driving around in his Humvee. In fact, to adequately address this issue, he should stop driving period.</narrative>
  <narrative>But we don't see any of this happening and probably won't in the future. The people worried about global warming are still driving to work every day. They come home to heated and air conditioned homes, turn on  their 42-inch flat panel television while getting their meal delivered by a college freshman in a fuel-efficient  3/4 -ton four-wheel drive vehicle so they don't have to crank up one of those double ovens and hear the latest news about climate  change. Recently a weather event caused a power outage in Arnold's state and not once did I hear him say, "thank goodness, now we can start to do something meaningful about man caused global warming."</narrative>
  <narrative>Politicians and proponents of global warming only want to personally do something about global warming if it doesn't mean a cold house in the winter or a hot one in the summer. Health clubs will still be needed because people won't walk to work and will need to get some exercise somewhere. And pine forests will grow old, die and burn while folks feel good about their bamboo floors. Thinking all along that they are getting their cake and eating it too.</narrative>
