    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to speak directly to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. The defense authorization conference report today has a section which I think Members need to look at. All of us who are familiar with the 1878, I think it is, Posse Comitatus Act know there was a reason to exclude the military from being involved in civil law enforcement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want you to listen to a section that is in this bill today, section 1615. I am going to read part of it. Section 1615 "Requires the Secretary to: (1) determine the military-unique capabilities needed to be provided by DOD to support civil authorities in an incident of national significance."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want people to think about this. We have an administration that has repeatedly violated the Constitution, that has taken this country into war based on lies, that is putting us in hock to China to pay for the wars, and that suborns torture and rendition. And now this. We have to be careful, America. We're losing our democracy. It's time for us to save it.</paragraph>
