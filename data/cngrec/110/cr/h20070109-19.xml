    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we must begin to think differently in America and join hands across the aisle. Our Nation must become secure now, not next week; and that is why I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As other Members have, I ask the current administration to present this Congress with a comprehensive plan for Iraq, a plan that makes sense, a plan based on the realities on the ground in Iraq and in the region, for all of us have the same goal: to build a better and more secure Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By working together, we will accomplish our shared mission, first, by implementing the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission; secondly, by securing our borders; and, finally, by protecting our Nation from threats from nuclear warfare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> as we begin to work together to build a better Nation and a more secure Nation for everyone.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
