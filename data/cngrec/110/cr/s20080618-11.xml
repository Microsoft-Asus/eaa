  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I just listened to my good friend the majority whip spend considerable time this morning complaining about obstruction and delay, so, as I indicated to him in advance, I am going to give him a chance to move forward, if they will just take yes for an answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 776, <bill type="s" number="3118">S. 3118</bill>, a bill to preserve Medicare beneficiary access to care, that the bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate Republicans had their chance last week to move to any measure relative to Medicare and they chose instead to filibuster and to fail to produce enough votes to move to the debate. This effort here is simply trying to create a political "get well" card for those who voted wrong, and I object.</paragraph>
