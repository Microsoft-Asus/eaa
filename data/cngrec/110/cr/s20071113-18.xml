  <narrative>PRESIDENTIAL VETO -- (Senate - November 13, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14243">S14243</bill>]</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. President, last week, Congress took bold action on behalf of American families by sending an appropriations bill to the President that has important new investments in the everyday needs and hopes and dreams of the American people. It is a bill that funds our investments in education, health care, and in American jobs. These are not optional investments. They are not just nice little programs that can be funded 1 year and cast aside the next. These investments are about hope and opportunity  for our children. They are about the dignity of middle-class and working families all across America. They are about our national strength. Unfortunately, it appears once again that the everyday concerns of the American people have fallen on deaf ears in the White House. This morning, the President vetoed this pro-family, pro-child, pro-worker legislation.</narrative>
  <narrative>In fact, the White House says this bill is irresponsible and reckless. I ask: What is irresponsible and reckless about making sure our children receive the best education in the world? What is irresponsible and reckless about finding a cure for cancer so families no longer see that disease claim their mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters before their time? What is irresponsible and reckless about giving our workers the training and the skills they need to get good jobs and support  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="14244">S14244</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>The President insists on continuing to spend billions of dollars on a failed policy in Iraq, but he refuses to deliver the relief America's families need. This morning, the President signed a Defense appropriations bill that includes a 10-percent increase in funding compared to last year, but he vetoed a bill that includes an increase of half that amount that would fund cancer research, investment in our schools, job training, and protection for our workers.</narrative>
  <narrative>Let's take a closer look at what the President has vetoed.</narrative>
  <narrative>The bill provides long overdue funding for education. Year after year, the White House and the Republican leadership in Congress have failed to make the needed new investments for better teachers and stronger schools. In fact, under Republican control, commitment to the education of our children has continued to go down.</narrative>
  <narrative>This chart shows in 2002, the year No Child Left Behind was passed, there was funding at $7.7 billion. We wanted reform and resources. We got it that time once it was passed. This chart shows the gradual diminution of support for funding under Republican Congresses and a Republican Senate. Now we see the beginning of the Democratic resolution and now the Democratic conference report and an increase. The President's request, $1.5 billion less; the Democratic conference report, $3.2 billion. And  we the find the legislation vetoed.</narrative>
  <narrative>This bill finally reverses that course of reductions over recent years under this administration. So it delivers the largest increase in title I funding since we passed No Child Left Behind. Again, we had the increase at the time of passage of the act and then a decline in resources, and now we see in 2008 there is an increase in the title I program for the neediest children in America. That was vetoed this morning.</narrative>
  <narrative>This bill delivers the largest increase in funding for education. That is funding that goes to the children who have fallen the furthest behind and need the most help. It pays for teachers, improved curriculum, tutors, and a whole array of actions that can help students do well in school.</narrative>
  <narrative>It provides $4.5 billion in additional funding in education compared to the President's budget. How can the President of the United States say he will leave no child behind when he has vetoed the very bill that will enable us to do that?</narrative>
  <narrative>We are working in Congress to renew the No Child Left Behind reforms and to make them work better, but we cannot do it with a "tin cup" education budget. This President seems to think we can improve our schools on the cheap. The President says $4.5 billion more to students is too much. Yet he is proposing 35 times that much for the war in Iraq. He wants us to say yes to $158 billion for Iraq, while he says no to $4.5 billion for American school children.</narrative>
  <narrative>In Iraq, anything goes. The sky's the limit. Billions and billions and billions of dollars for Iraq. But here in America, right at home, a modest investment in our school children gets a veto.</narrative>
  <narrative>This bill includes $1 billion for high-quality programs that help children after school; afterschool programs which are so important for children. Afterschool programs assist children with their homework, give them extra tutorial work, and give support when their parents are at work.</narrative>
  <narrative>These funds will help 1.4 million needy children who need a place to go after the school day ends. These are programs that help hard-working parents, improve student lives, and keep communities safe by decreasing drug use and violence.</narrative>
  <narrative>We can help these school children after school for the cost of 2 1/2  days in Iraq. But the President says no.</narrative>
  <narrative>The bill includes $3 billion to improve the quality of our teachers. Those funds will be used to hire 30,000 more teachers to reduce class sizes. How many days of hearings have we had that demonstrate smaller class sizes and well-trained teachers are absolutely essential? How many times do we have to learn that lesson? We understand that lesson. We have tried to, with bipartisan support, get these funds into this legislation to improve the support for our teachers.</narrative>
  <narrative>These funds, as I mentioned, hire 30,000 more teachers. They will be used for mentoring 100,000 beginning teachers and professional development for an additional 200,000 teachers who will go into underserved communities across this country. We can do all of that for the cost of a single week in Iraq. But the President says no.</narrative>
  <narrative>This bill includes $500 million to help our struggling schools turn around. Improving our schools means supporting them. We can provide support for our neediest schools for about the cost of a day in Iraq. We can take those schools that are falling further behind for a range of reasons--they may need restructuring, they may need additional assistance or targeted assistance, but whatever they need, they need to have this kind of assistance. But the President says no.</narrative>
  <narrative>The bill includes $7 billion to provide high-quality early education through Head Start. This week, the Congress will pass a Head Start bill that  will strengthen the program to make Head Start even better. Those funds will be used to ensure that nearly 1 million children are ready to learn when they enter kindergarten. These funds build a basic foundation for learning that will help these low-income and minority children for the rest of their lives. We can fund this program for the cost of a little more than 2 weeks in Iraq.</narrative>
  <narrative>We are going to have a conference report, virtually a unanimous conference report where we have worked out the differences, that we will pass in the Senate at the end of this week. The House is taking it up on Thursday. We will pass it the end of this week or the early part of next week. It includes so many of the recommendations of early education. We need high-quality individuals working in Head Start and working on the curriculum. We need to coordinate the various services for our children  in the early years, to smooth out the transition process from early education programs to kindergarten.</narrative>
  <narrative>We are beginning to get that seamless web of services that we all understand are critical. We are providing assistance in education and supports for children at the earliest ages. This continues on to kindergarten through 12th grade so children are ready for college and work. That is what we are desirous of, a continuum. Read that magnificent book of Jack Shonkoff, who is now at Harvard, formerly with the Heller School at Brandeis, "From Neurons to Neighborhoods." It brings together the three  great studies that were done by the Institute of Medicine about the developing of a child's brain, the synapsis, the cognitive and social abilities to deal with their social conditions, the development of knowledge, a sense of inquiry and curiosity that develops and settles in a child's brain.</narrative>
  <narrative>One cannot read that book and not understand that some of the best investments we make in education is in early education. We have taken so many of the lessons of that extraordinary document and have worked them through, Democrats and Republicans alike, in our conference. We will make real progress, but we need to invest the resources to do that. But when we came to do it and even as we work in Congress to improve the vital program, for the equivalent of 2 weeks in Iraq, the President said no.</narrative>
  <narrative>This same misguided rationale applies to other investments in the bill as well. The President's veto means squandered opportunities for progress on the major health challenges the American people face. I recently spoke to a gathering of leading cancer researchers who are making extraordinary progress against this deadly disease. They have helped cancer become, in many cases, a treatable illness instead of a death sentence. Every day, they are fighting to help Americans with cancer live longer  and longer and healthier lives.</narrative>
  <narrative>We have seen for the first time, in recent years, where the total number of cancer cases are going down. In the previous 20 years, we saw some modification of those numbers going up. When evaluated against the change in the age of our population and other indicators, it showed we were making some progress that was encouraging. But the most important and significant has been in recent years, where we see the total number of cases are going down.</narrative>
  <narrative>You cannot tell me that is not the result of the extraordinary investment  that was made in the Congress in recent years in doubling the NIH budget, with all of the progress we have made in mapping the human genome, sequencing the genes, various extraordinary breakthroughs that have come about. There are so many well-qualified, peer-reviewed projects that are on the desk at the NIH that will not be funded. These could offer hope for families in this  country who have been touched by the devastation of cancer.</narrative>
  <narrative>We provided in this legislation nearly $5 billion to fund more than 6,800 research grants to help win this fight. The President's veto tells Americans battling cancer that their fight for life is not a priority for the Nation. He tells patients they must wait a little longer, dream a little less, and hope a little more faintly for the breakthroughs that this research can bring.</narrative>
  <narrative>On and on down the line, the President vetoed urgently needed research in heart disease, diabetes, asthma, infectious disease, mental health, and many other areas. The President would rather squander billions in Iraq than invest in the research that could bring progress against these diseases and relief for millions of our fellow citizens.</narrative>
  <narrative>But the damage does not stop with the impact of this veto on the cures of the future. Patients today will feel the bite of the President's veto.</narrative>
  <narrative>Community Health Centers make quality health care possible for millions of Americans who cannot afford health insurance. A veto of the $2 billion for community health centers included in this bill means that 15 million low-income people will be denied their opportunity for health care. This, at a time when we are seeing the total number of uninsured increasing. The only reason it has not increased more is because of the CHIP program. If we didn't have the CHIP program, the 47 million with no  coverage would have been increased a good deal more. But if we look at the total number of Americans who are without health insurance over the course of the years, it is 75 million Americans out of a population of 300 million who sometime during the course of the year who lack adequate coverage, including 45 million who have no health care coverage at all. Those numbers are going up.</narrative>
  <narrative>Where do individuals go? They go to their neighborhood health centers. We have had remarkable bipartisan support in the expansion of these programs, but when we tried to put in the resources, some $2 billion for these centers included in this bill, it was vetoed. The Centers for Disease Control are on call to protect us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. When there is an outbreak or disaster, CDC is there.</narrative>
  <narrative>In my own community, in Massachusetts, over the weekend our water supply was closed down because E. coli had penetrated the water system. And here, with all of the various health challenges we have going on there is obviously a role for the FDA, but there is also a role for the Centers for Disease Control, which is extremely well led at the present time. They provide such importance when we are considering the pandemic dangers for this country, let alone the pandemic dangers as a result of terrorism  with biologics and chemicals. It will be the Centers for Disease Control that we are going to call on; our first responders. But, no, the President's veto means our Nation's health readiness will be weakened and our progress against disease will be halted.</narrative>
  <narrative>Training of new doctors and nurses, assistance to hospitals in rural and underserved communities, improving health information technology, immunizations programs, and on and on. The President has the same response to each of them: veto, veto, veto.</narrative>
  <narrative>The President's veto will also be devastating to America's workers. With globalization and layoffs and corporations cutting benefits, Americans are worried about their jobs. The least we can do is make sure they are safe on the job and treated with dignity.</narrative>
  <narrative>This bill provides the funds needed to enforce the labor laws that keep our workers safe and give them a level playing field. This bill has a very modest increase for OSHA, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration. Since the implementation of this law, the number of deaths has been cut by more than half in America. This is from $490 million to $501 million. This is the very minor increase in MSHA, the Mine Safety Health Administration, from $313 million to $340 million. Have we forgotten  what happened in the Sago mines in West Virginia or out in Utah, where scores of individuals lost their lives? And here we have the agency that is challenged with new legislation that reflected a bipartisan effort here in this body, Republicans and Democrats coming together making the recommendations, and making these recommendations as well, in order that we would have safety in the workforce. Yet that is vetoed.</narrative>
  <narrative>Just last week, three workers were killed in an explosion in a powerplant in Salem, Massachusetts. Terrible incidents like this are all too common. Every year, more than 5,700 workers are killed, with more than 4,000 injured or made ill on the job. Workers everywhere--at powerplants, coal mines, hospitals, and construction sites--rely on our Federal agencies to protect them and make sure they can return home to their families each night.</narrative>
  <narrative>But the President's veto takes bad employers off the hook and puts American workers at risk. We won't have the needed funds this bill provides to inspect workplaces and enforce our safety laws. Millions of workers' safety and very lives will be at risk.</narrative>
  <narrative>The veto of this bill is also devastating to veterans. We just observed Veterans Day. Each year, nearly 320,000 brave servicemembers return to civilian life, many coming from Iraq and Afghanistan. Sadly, our hearing in the Labor Committee last week showed they faced daunting challenges.</narrative>
  <narrative>Tens of thousands of Reserve and National Guard members have lost their benefits, and even their jobs because they served their country. That is why this bill provides $228 million to help our veterans find jobs, receive training--and protect their right to return to their former jobs. This is guaranteed in the law but not adequately fulfilled at this present time. The President's veto takes away this modest welcome mat and slams the door in our veterans' faces.</narrative>
  <narrative>All Americans are certainly familiar with what happened at Walter Reed, but there are so many other aspects that we are continuing to support. Senator Murkowski, Senator Murray, and many of our colleagues on the appropriate committees are making extraordinary efforts to help address these issues for our service men and women. But we must all recognize that one out of four of the homeless today is a veteran. One out of four of the homeless is a veteran. And if veterans return  to the United States without a job, with lost backpay, or lost health insurance, there is a rapid spiral right down into destitution and poverty and homelessness and, in some instances, suicide and other horrific behavior.</narrative>
  <narrative>What about other American workers who want to upgrade their skills to compete and win in the global economy? This bill says we should not cast workers and their dreams aside. It rejects the President's cut and includes $2.9 billion for job training. But the President's veto, again, leaves these hard-working Americans out in the cold.</narrative>
  <narrative>In my State of Massachusetts, there are 92,640 jobs that needed workers at the end of last year, and there are 178,000 people who didn't have jobs and were on the unemployment lists. It should be pretty understandable that if we can get those people trained and place them into productive employment, they are going to be productive, useful, and valuable workers in our communities. Their hopes and dreams for their families will be enhanced. And, through taxes, they will increase additional tax  revenues for the future. That kind of investment is necessary. But what happens, Mr. President? We see those programs have been effectively vetoed.</narrative>
  <narrative>This appropriations bill is about the strength and the well-being of American families. By vetoing the bill, the President is turning his back on the priorities of America's families--their hopes, their dreams, and their opportunities. But we will not give up on providing the solutions that are so desperately needed. We will continue to work with our colleagues in the Senate and the House and chart a new course and fight for the real needs of all Americans.</narrative>
  <narrative>This battle is not over. It has only just begun.</narrative>
