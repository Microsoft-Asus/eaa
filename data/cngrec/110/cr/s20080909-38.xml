    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great honor that today I recognize the 100th anniversary of Scandia Lutheran Church in Centerville, SD. This anniversary holds special meaning for my family and I, as my grandfather was previously blessed to be minister of Scandia Lutheran Church.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many years, the Scandia Lutheran Church has provided extraordinary spiritual assistance to individuals throughout the Centerville community. The church's religious leadership and commitment to education serve to inspire others, and its efforts in providing compassionate and spiritual guidance have enhanced the lives of countless South Dakotans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to have this opportunity to honor those, including my grandfather, who have made Scandia Lutheran Church what it is today. The celebration will be held September 13 and 14 with Bishop David Zellmer of the South Dakota Synod Evangelical Lutheran Church of America in attendance. Again, I commend the hard work and dedication of the pastors and congregation of Scandia Lutheran Church, and congratulate them on 100 years of worship.</paragraph>
