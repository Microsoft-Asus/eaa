  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise to speak about the great success of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. I recall when we passed the bill, you, Madam President, and everyone else were, in the well, very happy and joyous that we passed--after 15 or 20 years without one--a major energy bill. And then, right away, the next year, people wanted another energy bill. Now, this year, they want another one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to tell the Senate why the bill we have is doing so much good and how and why there is still room to try to implement it and, in doing that, to do it a lot more without a new bill. We need a bill to cover some things we did not cover, but I would like to end this, with people understanding this bill provides many things we have not done and many things that have been very successful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I urge policy makers in the administration and Congress to commit themselves to investing time, energy, and economic resources to fully implement this important act. We must achieve all we envisioned in passing this comprehensive energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past week marked the 18-month anniversary of the enactment of the Energy Policy Act. I rise today to speak about the gains we have made in strengthening our Nation's energy security and the even greater promise that lies ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 8, 2005, the President of the United States signed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 in my home State of New Mexico. This legislation is the catalyst of our Nation's nuclear renaissance and the driving force behind new investments in clean coal technology. Passage of the Energy bill also marks the genesis of a secure American electricity grid and the transformation of an agricultural enterprise into an energy industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This act has helped strengthen our energy security, stimulate our economy, create American jobs, and diversify our Nation's fuel supply. Simply put, since the passage of the Energy bill, America is on the move. We are starting up a renewable fuels industry in America through the first ever renewable fuels standard and a production tax credit. These policies have helped create approximately 160,000 American jobs across almost all sectors of our Nation's economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last 18 months, 73 new ethanol plants have broken ground, spurring us to exceed the biofuel mandate for 2006 by at least 800 million gallons. As a result of the Energy bill, 759 E85 ethanol pumps have been installed around the country. Today, there are over 6 million alternative-fuel vehicles on the road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand here today to tell you that even more can be done. I am pleased President Bush and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have committed to an even stronger, more robust biofuels policy. The President spoke of it. We are all interested in enforcing it and seeing it is done in the biomass area. We will work together on this important energy issue. Chairman Bingaman of the Energy Committee and I, as ranking member, will build on our Energy bill success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the Energy Policy Act, we are making significant breakthroughs in coal--America's most abundant and affordable energy resource. Because of the clean coal provisions in the legislation, there are 159 new coal-based facilities in various planning stages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the next 5 years, the United States will add an estimated 60,000 coal miners to the American workforce. The Energy bill will accelerate the development of a new generation of clean coal technologies. Because of title XIII of the Energy bill, the administration has appropriately and recently announced that it would award $1 billion in tax credits for clean coal projects such as IGCC projects for electricity generation, gasification projects, and other projects using innovative technologies.  With $650 million in tax credits to  come next year, we are providing incentives for the American people to make better choices about the kind of energy we will use. And because of the Energy bill, those choices will be clean energy choices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, 50 percent of our Nation's electricity comes from coal, and the EIA estimates that by 2025, 54 percent of electricity consumed will be generated from coal. In China, they are building a coal-fired powerplant every 10 days. Let it be our mission to invest both the human and capital resources to the goal of zero-emission, coal-based power generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having made the statement about China, let me hope that we will find a way to negotiate with China so that they, too, will begin to be concerned about what they are generating and begin some mutual programs of restraint. Wouldn't that be good news for the world? Let us dedicate ourselves to choosing a free-market, incentive approach rather than a punitive, regulatory approach to solving this global problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On nuclear energy, what did we do? In advancing nuclear power, Congress affirmed sound science and technology and rejected irrational fear. By doing this, we strengthened the nuclear renaissance in America. We provided Federal risk insurance for the first six nuclear reactors, production tax credits, and loan guarantees, and we renewed the Price-Anderson Act. All these initiatives and more provided evidence of our renewed support for clean nuclear power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Until the passage of the Energy bill 18 months ago, the world was passing us by on nuclear power. The renaissance was fading. Then Congress acted. Since that time, as many as 32 new nuclear reactors are in the planning stages. These nuclear plants would provide enough electricity to power 29 million homes. If these plants come into fruition, they will displace 270 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consider this: When all of those plants are operating for 5 years, it is estimated that they will have displaced the same amount of carbon emissions that the 230 million cars on the road in America today produce each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is what is at stake as we implement the various provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. We must do more to solve our growing nuclear waste problem, and we must do more to show Americans what the rest of the world already knows: nuclear power is the largest source of clean, carbon-free energy in the world. Advancing nuclear power is essential for our economic strength and environmental well-being. While we do it, we will not be able to stop using other kinds of energy. So the coal people  need not worry. They will be used, too, because this great land needs both and more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the passage of the Energy Policy Act, we helped to stabilize long-term prices of natural gas by providing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with the tools necessary to ensure the safe operation and reliability of our Nation's liquid natural gas assets. Since the passage of the Energy bill in August of 2005, FERC has approved seven new LNG terminals or terminal expansions. Working with private sector operators, FERC has brought on line the capacity equivalent of 1.34 billion cubic  feet per day of natural gas, with the potential to increase that to 13.3 billion cubic feet per day. We must continue to look for ways domestically to find additional supplies of natural gas, as we did last year with the passage of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In passing the Energy Policy Act, we substantially advanced renewable sources of energy in America. By the end of 2007, 2 million American homes will be powered by wind as we bring on line 6,000 megawatts of new wind power this year, part of the $4.5 billion in wind power investments spurred by the Energy bill. As a result of the wind power brought on line, we will displace 11 billion pounds of carbon dioxide annually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And there is so much more that we did. We promoted a modernized electricity grid, invested in solar energy, tax provisions that helped add almost 340,000 hybrid vehicles, and the list goes on. I continue to look for more to be done. In this Congress, we all will focus our efforts on convincing colleagues and the American people that the solutions to our energy and environmental challenges lie in the genius of the American people. I will not support energy policies that burden the people with  higher energy costs and undue regulations. I oppose the creation of additional unmanageable bureaucracy with its potential for punitive and burdensome regulations that harm the American worker. We will meet the challenge of providing clean, affordable, and abundant energy supplies in</paragraph>
