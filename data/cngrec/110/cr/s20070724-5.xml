  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - July 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9795">S9795</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are going to conclude action today--in fact, this morning--on the higher education authorization measure. It is a very important piece of legislation. We have not done this in 3 years. It is important this be completed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The good news I received walking into the Chamber today is it appears we will not have a vote on final passage. So that is really good work. Further, it underscores my repeated compliments of Senators Kennedy and Enzi for their true bipartisanship. This is the second bill in a row they have managed, and they have done a tremendously important and good job in getting the bills done in regular order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once we complete action on this education matter, we will move to the Homeland Security appropriations bill. Today, at 3:40 p.m., the Senate will observe a moment of silence in memory of Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut. A wreath-laying ceremony will take place at the Memorial Door at 3:30 p.m. I encourage Members to come to the Chamber at 3:40 p.m. to observe this moment of silence.</paragraph>
