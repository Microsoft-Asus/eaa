  <speaking speaker="400224" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate the community of Chaska, located southwest of the Twin Cities, and a town I'm proud to say is part of Minnesota's Second Congressional District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Money magazine confirmed what many of us in the great State of Minnesota already knew by naming Chaska as one of the top 10 best places to live in America. Money magazine accurately describes Chaska as having both beauty and brains. A stroll downtown Chaska by City Square Park brings to life images from Norman Rockwell paintings, depicting all that is good about small town America. Chaska's small 19th-century downtown quickly yields to open fields, farmland and the Minnesota River. It is also  home to innovation, with more than a dozen technology and biotech companies. It is no wonder why this town is a magnet for families who can find reasonably priced homes, low taxes and quality schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations again to the entire community of Chaska for earning this prestigious distinction. We in Minnesota's Second District are proud.</paragraph>
