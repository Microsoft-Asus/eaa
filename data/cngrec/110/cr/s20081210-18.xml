  <narrative>AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY -- (Senate - December 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10850">S10850</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, almost a quarter million Ohioans are employed, directly or indirectly, by the automobile industry. The compromise bill we have negotiated--which I hope will pass tonight--means much more than just bridge loans for auto companies. This legislation means hundreds of thousands of middle-class workers in Ohio, in Missouri, in Indiana, in Pennsylvania, in Michigan, and all over this country; hundreds of thousands of middle-class workers in my State will be able to keep their  jobs--jobs for car dealerships in all 50 States, jobs for suppliers in all 50 States. It means jobs at auto assembly plants and it means jobs at auto-stamping plants and engine plants in all those States I mentioned. It means communities would not suffer yet another blow from massive job loss. It means Ohio's economy and our Nation's economy will have a fighting chance to get back on track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Inaction means a present of pink slips for millions of American workers this Christmas. Bah humbug. There are some in this Chamber who would rather see our largest manufacturing industry go bankrupt rather than provide a bridge loan to success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's be clear about what this legislation will do. The legislation provides a bridge loan to auto companies, a loan that comes with strict oversight and with strict conditions--something, frankly, the Treasury Department did not do with the financial services industry. If the auto companies don't negotiate a real plan for restructuring their businesses, all the interested parties--that means the auto dealers, the suppliers, the bondholders, the workers, management--if they don't negotiate a  real plan for restructuring their businesses with all the interested parties, then the loan gets called in March or in April. This is not handing a checkbook over to the industry to make out whatever they think is fair. This legislation means accountability. It means transparency. It means no more corporate jets. It means no more golden parachutes when they hit turbulence. More importantly,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan compromise legislation will help ensure the long-term viability of the most important component in U.S. manufacturing--the auto industry. It will help ensure global competitiveness. It will help ensure and promote energy efficiency by developing advanced technology vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say it again. This legislation will save jobs. This bill is about jobs. It is about creating a middle class and strengthening the middle class. It is about jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back in November, the auto companies were given the task of developing detailed plans of how they would use taxpayer support and whether we, as Members of Congress and as the public, could have some assurance they would be able to survive and ultimately thrive. They submitted their plans on December 2, and they gave detailed proposals of how they will return to profitability. There are no absolute guarantees their plans will succeed, nor can there be guarantees. But based on reasonable assumptions--again,  a much higher standard than the financial institutions to which the Treasury Department has handed hundreds of billions of dollars--based on reasonable assumptions, these auto companies will return to financial health, and they will repay the Federal loans they are seeking within a few years' time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirty years ago, Chrysler borrowed more than $1 billion. They paid it back. The Government made money. They paid it back, in fact, more quickly than the Government asked them to initially. In the last month, the auto companies, dealing with us in this Congress, have done their part, and now it is our turn. We have two choices. We can either provide bridge loans to the auto industry or we can drive the economy off a bridge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seldom are the consequences of inaction so clear. If we do nothing, there will be a cascade of bankruptcies, not just in Detroit but across the country, including in the Presiding Officer's State of Missouri, in my State of Ohio, and across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week a steelmaker in Cleveland announced that 450 men and women need not come to work on Monday. Another week before that, in Lordstown, OH, GM announced a layoff of some number of autoworkers at the Lordstown GM assembly plant and, within days, major suppliers also announced layoffs. Some 40 percent of production goes to the auto industry from the steel plant I was talking about. It is already competing in an industry where foreign governments subsidize hand over foot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What happens to that steel mill if one or all of the big three go bankrupt?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These layoffs are not just numbers. A young woman from Youngstown, near Lordstown, wrote me about how her family moved off welfare when her father found a job when GM was hiring. She said the interview and testing process was extensive and the stakes for her family immense. When her father got the job, he was so happy he cried tears of joy. As somebody recently hired, she fears for her father and her family. The tears may soon be those of sorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week, Lordstown workers will conduct their annual food drive, feeding hundreds of families through the holidays. They contribute a third of the United Way budget. This plant contributes a third--these workers--to the United Way budget. They keep the hardware stores open. They keep the restaurants open. They fund the public schools with tax dollars. They keep firefighters on the street, police officers on the street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues may not appreciate the dramatic changes that have taken place in this industry. Employment, as a whole, has been cut in half. Productivity has started to match or exceed the foreign transplant factories. The UAW has agreed to extraordinary reductions in the pay and benefits of autoworkers in 2005, again last year, in 2007, and again now. The UAW has been a partner in these negotiations, as outlined by UAW President Gettelfinger to the Banking Committee only last week, and in putting  the industry on the path to match the costs of the competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we fail to act, the consequences will be felt throughout the economy--in the credit markets, the supplier industries, even the local newspaper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A little over 2 months ago it was the banking industry that faced a crisis with an urgent need for Federal help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said earlier, the differences in how we responded to the two crises are striking. The banking industry, initially, through the Secretary of the Treasury, gave us a three-page plan, a three-page bill for spending $700 billion. We obviously threw the three pages out because we wanted much more than that, but the revisions that came a week and a half later passed this Senate by a vote of 74 to 25.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The financial companies themselves, five of which have received more than $25 billion each, not only did not appear before Congress, they never produced a plan on how they would spend the money, nor had they been asked for one by Congress or the Bush administration. Contrast that with what we have talked about for the auto industry. They didn't have to testify about why they built or marketed structured investment vehicles, but we have heard plenty of debate about the building and marketing of  sport utility vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The idea Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke made before the Senate Banking Committee on behalf of the banking industry is it needed what it called patient capital that only the Federal Government could provide. The banking industry--Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke told us--was in peril, but given Federal support, in a few years' time, it would be back on its feet. I don't quarrel with the need to help the banking industry, though I have plenty of concerns for the way we are proceeding.  The need here is exactly the same in the auto industry, even though the standards for transparency we are setting are almost literally contrasted like night and day. The auto industry has been hit by the same collapse in the credit market that brought Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke to Capitol Hill on behalf of bankers. It has the same need for patient capital, a bridge loan to take it to the other side of the recession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know this can work; we have seen it work in the past, but we have no basis to believe people will buy cars from a company in bankruptcy. That is why we can't let it go to chapter 11 bankruptcy. A structured, prepackaged bankruptcy--whatever term the lawyers in this body wish to use--if it goes into bankruptcy, people would not buy cars in sufficient numbers to get this industry back on its feet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we saw with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, standing by while a company goes bankrupt would send shock waves to unexpected places throughout the economy. It was a terrible mistake that Secretary Paulson let Lehman Brothers collapse. It would be a terrible mistake if the Treasury Department doesn't step up--which apparently they will not--but it would be a terrible mistake if now the House and Senate do not step up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we fail to act, years from now some future Professor Bernanke, now Chairman of the Fed, will study our actions and will absolutely marvel at the missed opportunity--trillions of dollars committed to the financial sector, tens of billions denied the manufacturing sector, with millions of people losing their jobs on top of the more than 1 million who have already been laid off this year. If we fail to act, we will commit one of the biggest economic sins of omission in our history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Majority Leader Reid is absolutely right to insist that we stay here as long as we need to get this job done. Let's make it a truly merry Christmas in millions of living rooms in Lordstown, in Walton Hills, in Toledo, in Dayton, in Sharonville, in Mansfield, in towns all across the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
