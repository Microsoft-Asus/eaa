    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to recognize Deacon Joseph T. Lazo for receiving the 2007 Connie M. Hulsey Community Volunteer award presented at the Angels Among Us banquet. I would like to take some time to talk about this great honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deacon Joe Lazo is the director of the Covington Food Bank/St. Vincent de Paul Society. He has been known throughout the community as someone who works vigorously to provide many services day and night to those in need. In 2001, Deacon Joe and the St. Vincent de Paul Society worked tirelessly to set up a free medical and dental clinic in the Covington area. Through all of these programs, Deacon Joe Lazo has tremendously helped the needy citizens of the Saint Tammany, Tangipahoa, and Washington  Parishes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud Deacon Joseph Lazo on receiving this well-deserved recognition, and I wish him continued success in helping the citizens of the Northshore.</paragraph>
