    <paragraph>Mr. President, it was just a few days ago when we heard the news that we had lost our dear friend and colleague, Senator Craig Thomas. We lowered our flags and joined together as a family to say goodbye to someone who fought for what he believed in and worked to the end to make Wyoming and the West better places to live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig is now gone, but the work he began lives on. That is why I am pleased to offer an amendment to <bill type="s" number="277">S. 277</bill>, the Grand Teton National Park Extension Act of 2007. My amendment builds on the work begun by Craig and the efforts of Chairman Bingaman and Ranking Member Domenici who worked so hard to shepherd this bill through the legislative process. In addition, I also thank Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell for bringing this bill to the floor  so we can make one of Craig's legislative goals a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no surprise that Craig worked so hard to develop, draft, and introduce this legislation. No one understood the needs of Wyoming and the West better than he did. Craig was a cowboy from the top of his hat to the tip of his boots. There was nothing he enjoyed more than riding a horse through our national forests and spending time in the great outdoors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig's love for the wide open spaces of our State led him to introduce the Grand Teton National Park Extension Act of 2007. When it is signed into law, it will allow the Secretary of the Interior to accept the donation of approximately 50 acres of private land that will be added to Grand Teton National Park. In addition to Craig, we have the Halpin family to thank for their generosity. It will truly be a gift enjoyed by the people of Wyoming and the West, and the whole country, by all who come  to visit our national parks every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When that land is added to Grand Teton National Park, it will have another little addition to it. That addition is to rename the visitors center the Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center. It will provide the people with a place to stop and visit during their trips to Grand Teton where they can learn about the history of the park and the life of Craig Thomas. I cannot think of a better way to remember Craig's life than to share it with all who benefitted from his many years of hard work and  public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig dedicated his life to protecting and preserving our State's natural resources, especially our parks. He was a tireless and true advocate for those important and precious facilities, and he fought for their protection when he served as chairman and later as ranking member of the National Park Subcommittee of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig had a proud history on the committee and in the Senate as he constantly and consistently advocated for the best administration and management of our park system. He authored legislation that provided critical funding and mandated management reforms that were necessary to keep our parks pristine and ensure they would be available for future generations to enjoy. He worked with all of his colleagues, regardless of their party affiliation, to increase funding for our parks so they could better  deal with the maintenance backlog that exists. Now that he is gone, our parks have lost one of their best friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Renaming the visitors center will ensure Craig's legacy will continue and never be forgotten. As noted in a letter by the Grand Teton National Park Foundation:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Thomas championed this project since 1997. His leadership in securing an $8 million appropriation inspired the Foundation to raise $13.6 million in private funds for the project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For his efforts on this and so many issues of importance to our national park system, the Grand Teton National Park Foundation supports the naming of the center after Senator Thomas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that a copy of their letter of support be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the newly constructed Grand Teton Visitors Center is August 11, 2007. It will be a day that will be long remembered by all who come to honor the memory of one of the park's greatest champions. By passing this legislation, we are making that day possible and ensuring that those who attend that special ceremony will be the first to enjoy all the Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center will have to offer. This is an honor which I know would  have pleased Craig and made him very proud. I can also see him riding tall in the saddle of a horse, taking it all in under the brim of his favorite cowboy hat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Naming the visitors center for Craig Thomas will also mean a great deal to everyone who knew and loved him. It will be a tribute to a special American that will last for a long time to come. Many years from today, when people come to the park and stop by the visitors center that bears his name, they will know that Craig Thomas was so many things in life--a marine, a Senator, a rancher, and a dedicated father and husband. But most of all, they will know Craig loved Wyoming and the West and fought  with everything he had to maintain our precious resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I always said God saved some of his best handiwork for Wyoming. We are fortunate that he also gave us the best champion to fight to protect and preserve it all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration Calendar No. 41, <bill type="s" number="277">S. 277</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for bringing forward this bill on behalf of Senator Thomas, who was such a force in this Chamber and especially a force on behalf of his State. It is a very appropriate thing to do.</paragraph>
