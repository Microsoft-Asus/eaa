  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to offer my warmest congratulations to the students, faculty and staff of Marian High School on the 50th anniversary of the school's founding. This is indeed an important milestone, and the many contributions they have made are evident throughout the Detroit community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For a half century, the faculty and staff of Marian High School have worked tirelessly to educate young women and prepare them for college and the workforce. The school's emphasis in service instills the values of leadership and responsibility in Marian High students, and the strong academic curriculum, vast array of sports and activities, and qualified staff has contributed mightily to the success of many women over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Education is an investment in the future of our Nation, and students and schools must aspire to high standards. Throughout the last 50 years, the faculty and staff of Marian High School have met this challenge by fostering a nurturing and safe environment for its students to grow and develop. The most recent example of this is the class of 2007, which produced five National Merit Scholars, 37 Phi Beta Kappa Honorees, and numerous other scholarship  winners.  Students at Marian continued to consistently score above State and national averages on the SAT and ACT tests, a testament to the high standard of excellence cultivated at Marian High School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know my Senate colleagues join me in extending my congratulations to the faculty, staff, alumni, and students of Marian High School on the school's 50th anniversary. I wish them the best as they continue this important work for another half century.</paragraph>
