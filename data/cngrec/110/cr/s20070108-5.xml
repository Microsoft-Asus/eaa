    <paragraph>Mr. President, the time until 12 noon will be divided between the majority and minority. I know Senators LEVIN and STABENOW and SALAZAR want to make statements regarding President Ford. At noon we will have a rollcall vote on the adoption of <bill type="sr" number="19">S. Res. 19</bill>, which is a resolution honoring the late President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following that vote, we are going to begin consideration of <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>, the ethics package. This will be for opening statements. The minority has agreed that we could go to this bill in the morning. I appreciate that very much. We are going to work through this bill as quickly as we can. We would hope that people who want to offer amendments will be here tomorrow to offer amendments. The majority of the management of this bill will be by Senator Feinstein, whose committee, Rules, has most  of the jurisdiction. Senator Lieberman will comanage it because there are some aspects of this legislation under the jurisdiction of his committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the information of the Senate, there should be no other votes today after the 12 o'clock vote. Members are advised that the remainder of the week we should and will have rollcall votes during the day and into the evening. And we will have votes Friday. We hope to complete the voting by 12 noon if all goes right. But there will be votes Friday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will not finish this ethics bill this week, but we will finish next week, unless something untoward develops.</paragraph>
