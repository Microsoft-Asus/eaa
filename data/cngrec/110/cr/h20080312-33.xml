    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise in favor of moving the Pension Technical Corrections Act of 2008 forward in an expedited manner. The bill is most needed by employers who are committed to providing their employees with a financially secure retirement through a defined benefit plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why do we need this bill? Why do we need to act this quickly? Let me just break it down for you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 17, 2006, the President signed into law the Pension Protection Act. This bill imposed sweeping reform affecting how employers fund their defined benefits plans maintained for their employees. In addition, the bill imposed significant reforms for pension plans offered to many union workers who participated in multi-employer plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, many provisions in the PPA became effective on January 1 of this year. The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service cannot implement many of these provisions because they need further clarification of congressional intent. This bill provides the needed clarification for the Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service, corporations and other businesses who sponsor retirement plans, as well as working families who contribute to and benefit from 401(k) plans or defined contribution  plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the employers who have weathered the storm and are persistently committed to providing a secured retirement for their workers, this bill is for you. For the beneficiary of a 401(k) plan who wants to keep money in a retirement plan savings vehicle to finance retirement rather than being forced to spend it currently, this bill is for you. This bill provides clarification for the correct application of the non-spousal rollover provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the construction worker whose plan may be experiencing underfunding and could be subject to a benefit reduction, this bill will make it clear when the plan must provide you with the notice alerting you of the plan's funding status. It would also clarify whether you are subject to such a reduction in pension benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You see, Mr. Speaker, we are talking about quality-of-life issues for working families and about helping those employers who want to help their employees provide for a financially secure retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues in this body and in the Senate to keep this bill clean and move it quickly. I encourage them to join me in doing what we were sent here by our constituents to do, provide legislation to help improve their lives. Let's pass this bill and get it to the President before the end of the month, because people are waiting. We have kept them waiting long enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400351" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3361">H.R. 3361</bill>, the Pension Protection Technical Corrections Act. Given the complexity and broad reach of the Tax Code and ERISA, and the difficult interactions between them, the measure before us is necessary to correct drafting and other errors in the Pension Protection Act of 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passage of the legislation will give certainty to plan administrators, individuals, as well as government regulators and ensure the intent of Congress is fully reflected in the governing statutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The technical corrections process is a complicated one which ensures all views are heard and which brings in experts from the relevant committees and Federal agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this case, it means that bipartisan staff from both the Ways &amp; Means Committee and the Education &amp; Labor Committee were joined by their counterparts from the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate HELP Committee as well as representatives from the Treasury and Labor Departments and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Led by the staff of the Joint Tax Committee, the technical corrections process gives all participants a chance to review proposed changes to ensure they reflect the intent of Congress and do not change the substance of the law itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There can be disagreements about what should and should not be considered technical. Each participant in the process has a veto. Thus, only items that were unanimously viewed as correcting a drafting mistake are included in the measure being debated today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is one item, called smoothing, that we viewed as a particularly important technical correction but is not included in this bill because one of the parties to the process said it was not technical. Regardless of whether smoothing is technical, it is extremely important and must be passed quickly. Given that smoothing was excluded from this bill, I urge that we take up a smoothing-only bill on suspension this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding that the Joint Tax Committee will be publishing on their web page a complete summary of these items, and I encourage interested individuals to review it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two final observations, Mr. Speaker, on the differences between this bill and the version passed by the Senate in December.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, since the Senate bill was passed, several additional technical items were identified, reviewed by the participants, and agreed to as being technical and conforming changes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the Senate-passed bill included smoothing and a second provision that is no longer relevant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that the Senate takes up the bill that we are passing today so that it can go to the President and be signed into law. I also hope that both houses quickly pass a smoothing-only bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while hardly glamorous, the technical corrections process is an important one, providing clarity and certainty to plan administrators and the millions of Americans who rely on these plans to help provide a secure retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support passage of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400323" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have just made formally a matter of record, the Pension Protection Act was an imperfect piece of legislation. This technically corrects, not substantively changes, but technically corrects an imperfect bill. It should go forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should be doing more, Mr. Speaker, and this is where I want to spend the balance of my time tonight. I am almost shaking with anger at what we are not doing to correct the Pension Protection Act before it will have a very negative impact on the very working people that we talk so much about trying to help. I will give you a couple of examples.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a provision in the bill, never discussed, that inadvertently changes funding requirements for public pension plans. A plan like the State of North Dakota offers for its employees has a rate of 7.5 percent. Well, the Pension Protection Act in its present form requires them to credit interest at no greater than market rate. Without correction, we are going to have State legislatures reducing the interest credited for their public employees under fully funded public plans. It makes no sense.  It needs fixing. It is a mistake. But we can't get the critical people in the critical committees to agree to fixing this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's make no mistake about who we are talking about. We are talking about the Education and Labor Committee and we are talking about the Ways and Means Committee. Those are the committees of jurisdiction. We have not been able to get critical an agreement between the leadership of those committees and ranking members on fixing this public provision. And, as a result, for no reason whatsoever, other than an act of Congress that wasn't meant to have this impact, people may have their pensions  reduced by Federal requirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want those workers to know, Congress didn't mean to do this. But Congress knows that that is the effect of the law we passed, and this is a Congress that can't fix it in a timely fashion because we haven't had the will, we haven't had the time to think about it. We don't care enough. Because of the inattention of this body, if workers are forced to take lower credited interest in these public plans, these workers get less of a pension, and for no reason whatsoever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is another provision we should be fixing. These provisions are a little more than technical, so maybe should have been another bill, maybe not under the technical corrections act, but a bill we could have brought like tonight under the suspension calendar, a bill to address funding in a reasonable way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, a pension is paid over many, many years. Yet the funding balance is determined by things that capture where the stock market is today, what the interest rate is today. Now, that can give you a pretty dire picture if you have got a stock market that is tanking and a low interest rate environment. It may look suddenly like forevermore the plan isn't going to earn much money on its assets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we know that the interest rate is going to change and we know the stock market valuation is going to change. So if you project 30 years based on today's picture, you are going to be coming up with a wrong number. There is something called asset smoothing that lets you basically average a bit so that a bad picture today doesn't mean a draconian funding requirement upon the employer to meet what looks like a funding requirement that is not in fact reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Now, some might think, well, gosh, if the employer has to put in more money than is really needed that just is a good thing for workers because that means there will be a lot of money in there, and in no way will that solve it. There is a hitch to this. Employers do not have to fund pension plans. Employers can freeze pension plans. They can get out of the pension business. In fact, my friends, 99 pensions have frozen since we passed the Pension Protection Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here in a recession, where we have got businesses struggling, they are going to have to pony up on their pensions beyond what they ever have before because in the pension protection act we have got much stiffer funding requirements. Smoothing, which many of us intended to be in this bill, is not in the bill, and we need to add it to the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this Congress, failing to act, is going to leave employers to pay the full bill, no smoothing help. I truly believe, just as I stand here, that there will be plans deciding to freeze, workers losing their pensions because in this time, before we go out on break, we don't address smoothing.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, I welcome that, because when the Pension Protection Act passed in the last Congress when the minority was the majority, I did not find that willingness to work with me. The legislation, I believe, needed correcting. This is a pox on both parties.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time before I run out of time, this is a pox on both parties. Both parties passed it, and both parties have failed to fix it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the failure, relative to getting this fixed, is on both parties. But the majority party carries a disproportionate burden because we are the majority party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could not be more disappointed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Getting back to the point I was making about frozen plans, I believe plans will freeze and workers will lose their pensions because asset smoothing is not addressed on the suspension calendar before we go out, before this critical April 15 deadline for pension funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is completely unacceptable. It's incompetent, and I am ashamed of this House in failing to address this before we leave. I hope that I have made some people angry by these comments. I have intended to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to get after this, and we need to get after it when we are back. If we don't get after it, I assure you, I will be having more of these speeches, because those who pretend to protect the world, the world's workers, when what they are doing is protecting these workers out of their very pensions, the very thing they need for retirement, income security. They are not doing anybody any favors. The games have got to end. The posture has got to end. We have got to fix problems and fix them  in a timely way and shame on us if we have fallen short.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me get back to the bill before us, because it's important. The bill before us is a technical corrections act. This one needs to pass. This is fine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is, there is so much more that needed to be done, that could have been done on a suspension calendar tonight and tomorrow. We didn't do it, and we need to do it in short order when we get back.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3361">H.R. 3361</bill>, the Pension Protection Technical Corrections Act of 2008, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in 2006, the Republican-led Congress passed, and President Bush signed into law, the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which represented the most comprehensive reform of our Nation's private pension system in a generation. After years of thorough examination, thoughtful legislative development, and careful coalition-building, we finally restored common sense to our Nation's pension system through enactment of this landmark law. Thanks to those reforms, today's retirement security laws  match the new realities of the 21st century economy, meaning that more U.S. workers will be able to count on their retirement savings being there for them when they need it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Pension Protection Act included tough new funding requirements to ensure employers adequately and consistently fund their  pension plans, provided workers with meaningful disclosure about the financial status of their benefits, and protected taxpayers from a possible multi-billion dollar bailout of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Pension Protection Act's reforms were built on six fundamental principles that helped ensure a stronger, more secure retirement for millions of American workers. Those principles were: certainty, with a permanent and more accurate calculation of employers' pension liabilities; common sense, which enabled employers to build up a cushion in their pension plans during good economic times; stability, achieved by closing funding loopholes and ensuring employers make adequate and consistent cash  payments to their plans; transparency through timely and straightforward information given to employees about the health of their retirement plans; honesty from employers and union leaders, who are no longer permitted to make hollow promises of extra benefits that will never materialize because a plan is severely underfunded; and portability,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, it is to be expected that in legislation of that magnitude, we did not get every word perfect, or every provision as clear as it could be. That is the point of the bill before us today--H.R. 3361 is a narrow, technical bill that corrects inadvertent errors in drafting contained in the original law, and provides necessary clarification and focus, to ensure that the law is administered as Congress intended. For that reason, I support the bill before us today, and hope that it will quickly  be enacted into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must note for the record, however, that more remains to be done. The bill before us is very narrow in scope, and addresses only those issues that are considered purely technical on a consensus basis. There are other issues that remain to be addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, late last year, the Senate passed by unanimous consent its own version of a technical corrections bill, which included critical clarifications with respect to the issue of asset smoothing. I would hope that this issue is addressed in any final technical correction package that we consider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, there are numerous provisions which Members and staff have discussed since enactment of the 2006 law, which enjoy broad, bipartisan support, but which did not fall within the scope of this narrow package of technical corrections. Going forward, it will be necessary for us to address these items, and I stand ready to work with my Chairman, Mr. MILLER, and the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Ways and Means Committee in doing so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, with that, I reiterate my support for this narrow legislation.</paragraph>
