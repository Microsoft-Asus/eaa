  <narrative>CONSTITUTION DAY -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10409]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400655" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Preamble of the Constitution reads: "We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this day, 220 years ago, the 55 delegates to the Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia to hold their final meeting and sign a document that would change the course of history. Our Founding Fathers created a monumental plan to govern a sprawling young country dedicated to the idea that citizens were sovereign and should be as free from the tyranny of unchecked authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Constitution Day presents us with an opportunity to pause and reflect on what a magnificent job these 55 individuals did in crafting a compromise which has provided us with a unified and stable Nation. In their wisdom, they sought to protect the rights and liberties of individuals by dividing power and authority between States and the national government. The result is a system of shared roles designed to prevent any one element from gaining too much power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of Congress have taken an oath to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution and with that responsibility in mind it is vital for us to fully understand this sacred document. That is why today on the 220th anniversary of the signing of our Constitution I am introducing the AMERICA Act: A Modest Effort to Read and Instill the Constitution Again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The AMERICA Act simply states that Members of Congress, Senators, and their respective staff read the Constitution annually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we Members of Congress are pledged to uphold this Constitution, to defend this Constitution, write the laws that implement this Constitution and from time to time propose constitutional amendments to change this Constitution. It is my hope that this modest yearly effort will renew and deepen our appreciation for the brilliance of the Constitution and the division and constraints on power contained within it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The AMERICA Act is meant to be a reminder to lawmakers to stay within our country's founding framework as we conduct our legislative business. To our detriment, we often take the path of political expedience and ignore the limits so clearly written into the Constitution</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I call on all Members of Congress to join me and rededicate ourselves to our founding principles of limited, constrained governance as enshrined in our Constitution. By studying our founding document, we will continue the legacy of these great men and their groundbreaking ideas, as well as develop the habits of citizenship  that keep the Constitution alive and relevant for our new generation of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge you all to join me in cosponsoring the Support America Act and its vital passage</paragraph>
