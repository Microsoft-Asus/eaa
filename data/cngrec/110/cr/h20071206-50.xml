  <narrative>OHIO'S OUTSTANDING HIGH SCHOOLS -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H14452]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400071" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the congressional district that has so many outstanding high schools. Not only do these schools excel in academics, but they are home to some of the most gifted scholar-athletes in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just this fall, Cincinnati witnessed two of our young women's high school volleyball teams, Mother of Mercy and Mount Notre Dame, meet for the second State championship in the last 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After spending much of the season at the top of the rankings, Mercy senior leadership kept them strong at the end. Seniors Missy Harpenau, Stephanie Vorherr, Michelle James, and Kelly O'Connor lead the charge during the final games. Though Mount Notre Dame's standout players, Rachel Adams and Abbie Rees, rallied teammates for wins in the first and third sets, the Cougars couldn't hold on for a repeat of their 2006 success in winning the State championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mercy avenged last year's championship loss with a 15-11 victory in the last minutes to finish a great season for Mercy and Coach Denise Harvey, as well as Mercy's fourth volleyball State title in program history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the interest of full disclosure, Mother of Mercy is near and dear to my heart because my wife, Donna, and my daughter, Erica, and my sister, Carol, are all Mother of Mercy graduates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A third Cincinnati area high school, the St. Ursula Academy Bulldogs, have become a mainstay in the State soccer tournament, advancing to their third finals in 7 years. Down 1-0 at the half, St. Ursula rallied with goals by Tori Huster and Alexandra Berry to beat Strongsville 2-1. St. Ursula finished with a remarkable 20-1-2 record and a third State championship, the other two coming back in 1991 and 1993.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, finally, I have the honor of congratulating St. Xavier High School for its second Ohio High School Division I State Football Championship in the last 3 years. On its way to a perfect 15-0 record, St. Xavier had probably the toughest schedule in the entire Nation, beating State champions from Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and national powerhouse DeMatha from locally here in Maryland. St. X also had the distinction of being the number one ranked team in the State the entire year and number one  in the Nation in some polls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>St. Xavier's victory gave the district that I have the honor to represent its fifth division I State football title in the last 6 years, five out of the last 6 years, including Elder High School, who won it twice. I have two nephews, Joe Del Prince, who graduated last year, scored a number of touchdowns on the team last year, and his brother, my nephew, Mike Del Prince, who scored a touchdown against St. X. Unfortunately, when he scored that touchdown, he was hit pretty hard; and I ended up seeing  him in the hospital a couple days later. But he's doing well, and he'll be great as a senior next year. And my brother, Ron, also is an Elder grad, played first singles tennis there some years ago, was on student council, and that kind of gave me my interest in politics, seeing my brother Ron succeed in that respect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this also, this victory by St. X was their 38th State title in all sports, the most of any high school in the State. St. X was led by a senior class that compiled a record of 40 wins and two losses in their 4 years at the school, including Fred Craig, the Ohio defensive player of the Year, and Danny Milligan, the Ohio co-offensive player of the year, and running back Darius Ashley, who set a division I record by rushing for 271 yards and two touchdowns in the championship game. Just incredible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kudos to head coach Steve Specht and the entire coaching staff for their tremendous accomplishments. Congratulations, St. X. And, again, in the interest of full disclosure, our son, Randy, is a senior at St. X and one of their great band field commanders under the leadership of Anthony Palm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of these student athletes have learned invaluable lessons about commitment, teamwork and perseverance that will serve each of them well as they prepare for the future. Both on and off the field they have helped further the tradition of excellence at their schools for which all of Cincinnati can be proud. It is an honor for me to congratulate these young men and women on the floor of the United States House of Representatives.</paragraph>
