  <speaking speaker="412214" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we're here to congratulate a basketball team at Winona State University, but I think it's important to put it into the greater context of what our young people are doing here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'll talk a little bit in just a minute about the great accomplishments of what this team did, but I think it's equally important to understand the institution that they're coming from. Winona State University is in the town of Winona, Minnesota. That's on the western bank of the Mississippi River.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Winona State University was founded at the same time as the State of Minnesota was founded. We're celebrating our sesquicentennial in the North Star State this year. And Winona State University was the first teachers college  west of the Mississippi River. That institution, that public institution of higher learning has fulfilled its calling and its mission for the last 150 years, at the highest quality of achievement that we could ask for. I congratulate  President Judith Ramaley for her work. I also congratulate Vice President Jim Schmidt. He's the Vice President of Advancement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some things going on at Winona State University, like the National Child Protection Training Center, the work they're doing educating our teachers, nurses, law enforcement officials that I think are equally as important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think it's important to understand that in a well-balanced education like our student athletes are getting at Winona State University, stressing the extra-curriculars and the teamwork that goes to that, and the striving for excellence is important, so I'd like to talk just a bit about this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A little over a month ago, during our own March Madness in Minnesota, Winona State defeated Augusta State 87-76. This was the second national championship in the last 3 years, and three straight trips to the national championship. We're really proud of this dynasty that's being developed amongst these student athletes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to their national championship, they've won nine conference titles in a row. They've also won three straight Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference titles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006 and 2007 they broke the Division II record of 57 straight victories. In 2008 the Warriors finished with a record of 38-1, an NCAA Division II record. Over the past 3 years, their record is 105-6.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Five seniors have been together throughout this entire run, and they should be congratulated. They'll all be graduating this year, and I'd like to congratulate each one of them individually. John Smith, Jonte Flowers, Quincy Henderson, Shane Neiss and Brent Riese. Together, those five individuals compiled a 129-17 record in 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course all of this wouldn't be possible without the leadership of coach Mike Leaf, who's done an outstanding job of working with the character as well as the accomplishments of these fine young athletes. I'm extremely proud to have Winona State University in the district that I represent; extremely proud of the student athletes that represent Southern Minnesota so well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask today for, hopefully, unanimous consent from my colleagues to recognize them on this great achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also make, as a side note, Winona State boasts some famous alumnas. One of them is my colleague on the minority side, Mrs. BACHMANN, and we're very proud to have her here, and Winona State for producing our Congresswoman from up in the Sixth District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400070" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank and congratulate the gentleman from Minnesota with respect to Winona State University's great year and great record over the last 3 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By sort of coincidence, I happened to watch part of this game on television, I think the last half of the game, and they had a remarkable comeback as they beat the Augusta State University team. They are really a superb basketball team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the pleasure of playing a little bit of Division III basketball many years ago. And either basketball's improved tremendously in those intervening years, or Division II is a heck of a lot better than Division III. These guys could really play basketball, and they were extremely impressive in terms of what they did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also congratulate the young men for their academic prowess. This is a college of some distinction. For that, they and all administrators deserve congratulations as well. We congratulate the head coach, Mike Leaf, who was named the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference coach of the year four times, and national coach of the year two times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a team which has won two national titles and three straight North Central Region titles from 2006, 2007 and 2008, and four straight regular season championships and three straight conference tournament championships. Not many teams at any level of sports can make claims such as that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The college, as the sponsor has indicated, is a significant institution in Minnesota, and does a wonderful job in its programs preparing young people for the rest of their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We congratulate the President, Judith Ramaley, and the Athletic Director, Larry Holstad, the head coach, as I've indicated, and all the friends and supporters of a fine university which had a tremendous year this year in basketball. But just recognizing the tremendous school which they are and for which they deserve great credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge everybody to support the resolution, and I yield back the balance of our time.</paragraph>
