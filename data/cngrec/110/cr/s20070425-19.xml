    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I congratulate my good friend Charles A. Scholz. On April 29, he will be honored by the Mississippi Valley Council, Boy Scouts of America and presented with the 2007 Distinguished Citizen Award. This commendation recognizes the important contributions of American men and women to scouting and their community. Charles A. Scholz is certainly deserving of such an award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie has spent most of his life in Quincy, IL. At 80, he retains fond memories of his years as a Boy Scout in Quincy. Charlie attended St. Francis Grade School and Quincy Notre Dame High School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beginning in July of 1944, he served in the Navy V-12 Program, a unique initiative designed to recruit commissioned officers during World War II and allow young men to pursue college degrees while serving on active duty. Charlie continued his education at Mercer University, ultimately receiving his juris doctorate degree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduation, Charlie returned home to Quincy. On June 10, 1950, he married the late Nancy Wright. Together they raised seven children in Quincy, instilling in each a desire to serve the community. The success achieved by the Scholz children, serves as a testament to Charlie and Nancy's characters, as well as their dedication to the family and their faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie has been a successful attorney in Quincy for years; but he is known equally well for his continuing efforts to give back to the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 25 years, Charlie served on the board of directors of the Quincy Free Public Library. During his tenure as president of the library board, volunteers carried out a successful campaign to raise funds for a new library. Charlie also served board of trustees of the former St. Mary's Hospital in Quincy, first as a member and then as the board's president.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie founded the Quincy Notre Dame Foundation to help support his alma mater. He served on the board of governors of the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor Foundation, Inc. and served as a member of the Board of Land of Lincoln Legal Services Foundation. In addition, Charlie was a past member of the Board of directors of the Community Foundation of Quincy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, "Everyone can be great, because everyone can serve." Well, Charlie Scholz has taken that declaration to heart. He lives a life committed to his family, his faith, and his community. I congratulate him on receiving this award and thank him for his years of service.</paragraph>
