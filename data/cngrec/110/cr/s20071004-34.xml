    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a challenge facing our military forces on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan. These forces are facing an urgent need for a precision indirect fire munition organic to the Infantry Brigade Combat Teams and Stryker Brigade Combat Teams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last 3 months there have been two Operational Needs Statements submitted by the units deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq. I have included these statements for the Record. Both of these documents highlight the urgent need to field a precision capability for the 120mm mortar: the main, and in some cases the only, indirect fire support available to our infantry in the close fight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The commander of the XVIII Airborne Corps wrote in July:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This capability is critically needed within the next 12 months. As troop levels in theater begin to drop, our units can not afford to miss any opportunities to kill the enemy due to lack of organic precision indirect fire. Without it, IBCT's must resort to: slower reinforcing fires; committing soldiers to an assault; or missing the opportunity altogether.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In August the Commander of Joint Fires in Afghanistan described the problem starkly:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Rules of Engagement for the Afghanistan Theater of Operations limits the use of conventional artillery and mortar projectiles in support of combat operations. Recently, COMISAF restricted all preparatory fires and pre-assault fires to precision guided munitions and systems. Currently, Afghanistan requires two Light Brigade Combat teams with no organic surface precision strike capability. Our enemy takes advantage of that gap by hiding among the local populace. Additionally, the COIN environment  in Afghanistan requires the minimization of collateral damage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both of these field commanders specifically call for the fielding of precision guided mortars for the existing 120mm mortar system as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding that since the precision guided mortar munition, PGMM, fell prey to the Army budget cutters, the program has demonstrated remarkable test results. In fact, I thank the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee for rejecting the Army's request to reprogram additional funding away from PGMM.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask that the subcommittee continue to carry this item forward to be considered as part of a final conference report or supplemental, pending the results of ongoing Army reviews of the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the two documents which I referred to be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY,</narrative>
  <narrative>Fort Bragg, NC, July 19, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>1. Reference: Memorandum, XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg, AFZA-CG, 21 November 2005, subject: ONS for Improved 105mm Projectiles.</narrative>
  <narrative>2. Unit Identification Code (UIC): WAUKAA.</narrative>
  <narrative>3. Ship to Address: Building 2-1138, Macomb and Hamilton Streets, Fort Bragg, North Carolina 28310.</narrative>
  <narrative>4. Problem: Termination of the Precision Guided Mortar Munition (PGMM) has left IBCTs without the organic precision indirect capability. In our current environment, our enemy takes advantage of that gap by hiding among the local populace. The tasks of finding, fixing, and killing or capturing the enemy must be executed in rapid sucession or the opportunity is lost. Heavy Brigade Combat Teams (HBCT) and Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) have organic option (Excalibur) available; the IBCTs do  not.</narrative>
  <narrative>5. Justification:  a. The IBCTs' requirement for organic precision indirect munitions is well documented. There is an approved requirement for PGMM. The Army Field Artillery School is now writing a requirement document for a precision guided 105mm munition. This headquarters submitted an ONS for a precision guided 105mm munition.</narrative>
  <narrative>b. Lacking the required accuracy, IBCT's howitzers and mortars remain silent while the IBCTs' headquarters request GMLRS, close air support, or fires from an adjacent HBCT or SBCT. Coordinating and directing fires through multiple levels of commands consumes time and opportunity. Direct fire missile systems (ITAS and JAVELIN) do not meet this requirement due to their limited range and precision.  c. This capability is critically needed within the next 12 months. As troop levels in theater begin to drop, our units cannot afford to miss any opportunity to kill the enemy due to lack of organic precision indirect fire. Without it, IBCTs must resort to: slower reinforcing fires; committing Soldiers to an assault; or missing the opportunity altogether.</narrative>
  <narrative>6. System Characteristics: Organic precision indirect capability must: be organic to the IBCT and use existing assets (i.e. mortars and howitzers); have accuracy consistent with the Excalibur or GMLRS; have at least the range of the current M120 120mm Mortar; and in the objective capability, should have both GPS and laser guidance.</narrative>
  <narrative>7. Operational Concept: An organic precision indirect munition will allow comanders to engage targets in environments that ordinarily require putting Soldiers and non-combatants in harms way or cause unnecessary collateral damage.</narrative>
  <narrative>8. Organization Concept: The organic mortar platoons or artillery battalion will fire this munition.</narrative>
  <narrative>9. Support Requirements: If a munition uses laser guidance, then there must be a corresponding increase in laser designators. Full MTOE authorization, not Force Feasibility Review sourcing levels, of the Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR) and M707 Knight is required to make a laser guided capability viable.</narrative>
  <narrative>10. Availability: Before its termination, the PGMM met the requirement. There are also 105mm precision munitions available.</narrative>
  <narrative>11. Recommendation: Field an organic precision indirect munition to deploying IBCTs within 12 months.</narrative>
  <narrative>12. Point of contact is LTC Greg Rawlings, ACofS, G7 at DSN 236-9485, Commercial (910) 396-9485, or email: gregory.rawlins@us.army.mil.</narrative>
  <narrative>Lloyd J. Austin III,</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,</narrative>
  <narrative>Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan, August 17, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>1. Unit Identification Code (UIC) is W91M2D.</narrative>
  <narrative>2. Ship to address: (W91M2D) Joy O'Brian, C4ISR CECOM RSC (MANTECH) Thomas Fuller Compound, Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan, APO AE 09354</narrative>
  <narrative>3. Problem: The Rules of Engagement for the Afghanistan Theater of Operations limits the use of conventional artillery and mortar projectiles in support of combat operations. Recently, COMISAF restricted all preparatory fires and pre-assault fires to precision guided munitions and systems. Currently Afghanistan requires two Light Brigade Combat Teams with no organic surface to surface precision strike capability. Our enemy takes advantage of that gap by hiding among the local populace. Additionally,  the COIN environment in Afghanistan requires a minimization of collateral damage whenever joint fires are employed.</narrative>
  <narrative>4. Justification:  a. In order to meet theater ROE requirements for precision guidance and provide our maneuver commanders with a dedicated 105mm and 120mm capability that minimizes collateral damage, precision munitions for both the M119A2 and 120mm Mortar are required.</narrative>
  <narrative>b. The addition of the 105mm and 120mm PGM will give commanders a more prolific economy of force. Currently the limited Close Air Support (CAS) platforms are the only asset with the ability to fire precision guided munitions. This ability will give the BCT commanders the capability to strike a  target where time is sensitive or awaiting CAS to arrive on station will encumber a mission's accomplishment. This capacity will minimize the number of CAS sorties  from being pulled from its original mission, thus economizing force.</narrative>
  <narrative>c. CJTF-82's acquisition of 105mm/120mm PGMs will minimize the volume of fire that is required to destroy a target with surface to surface unguided munitions. Within a three day period the average amount of munitions fired within the two BCTs battlespace are: 97 high explosive 105mm rounds and 72 high explosive 120mm rounds. These PGM munitions will ultimately reduce the amount of munitions required to destroy targets. Providing commanders with precision strikes that need no adjustment while  lessening the amount of ammunition resupply missions.</narrative>
  <narrative>d. These precision guided munitions would provide CJTF-82 with a dedicated capability to attack various target sets with precision by all of its major organic artillery and mortar systems. The increased accuracy and effectiveness of these munitions would provide the ground commander the ability to employ fires in support of MOUT and troops in close proximity of enemy forces while decreasing the possibility of collateral damage.</narrative>
  <narrative>5. System Characteristics: While several variants of precision guided munitions are in the testing and development phase for the 105mm howitzer and the 120mm mortar, a low circular error probable (CEP) would be required for any fielded munitions. Additionally, the nature of operations in theater would require any precision guided munitions to use both GPS based guidance system and laser guidance.</narrative>
  <narrative>6. Operational Concept: The employment of these munitions would be at numerous forward operating bases and combat outposts cross the CJOA. This operational concept would enhance the ground commanders' ability to conduct all weather precision strikes against the enemy positions in keeping with ISAF's restrictions on the use of indirect fires.</narrative>
  <narrative>7. Organizational Concept: The 105mm howitzer precision guided munitions will be issued to the field artillery and battalions of each brigade combat team to support maneuver elements with precision guided fires while minimizing of collateral damage. The 120mm mortar precision guided munitions will be issued to the battalions who own battle space within each brigade combat team to support their maneuver elements with precision guided fires while minimizing of collateral damage</narrative>
  <narrative>8. Procurement Objective: CJTF-82 urgently requests the immediate procurement and fielding of these munitions in order to meet COMISAF's restrictions for the application of Joint Fires within the CJOA and provide organic indirect fire support with precision strike capability for all maneuver elements conducting combat operations in Afghanistan.</narrative>
  <narrative>9. Support Requirements:  a. If a munition uses laser guidance, then there must be a corresponding increase in laser designators. Full MTOE authorization, not Force Feasibility Review sourcing levels, of the Lightweight Laser Designator (LLDR) and M707 Knight is required to make a laser guided capability viable.</narrative>
  <narrative>b. CJTF-82 would require initial contractor and mobile training team (MTT) support for this rapid fielding.</narrative>
  <narrative>10. Availability: Production and fielding of the projectiles is currently in the RDTE phase. These munitions are not Army programs of record.</narrative>
  <narrative>11. Recommendation: The Department of the Army approves and endorses the procurement and rapid fielding of a Precision Guided Munitions for the 105 mm howitzer and 120mm mortar in support of Operation Enduring Freedom 07-09.</narrative>
  <narrative>12. The point of contact for this memorandum is MAJ Kelly Webster, CJ3 Chief of Fires, Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan, Kelly.I.webster@citf76.centcom.mil, DSN 318-231-4024.</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I filed an amendment which would appropriate the necessary funds to require the Department of Homeland Security to develop a pilot program to test entry document verification technology. This technology allows border agents to quickly check travel document such as drivers' licenses, passports, and visas against a stored database of legitimate domestic and international travel documents. L1 Communications, a company with a plant in Wilmington, MA, is helping produce  this technology and would be an eligible company for this funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commission Report stated that "for terrorists, travel documents are as important as weapons." The report concluded that "better technology and training to detect terrorist travel documents are the most important immediate steps to reduce America's vulnerability to clandestine entry." It recommended that the Government develop a strategy to thwart terrorist travel that would incorporate better document authentication technology. Unfortunately, the technology that Customs and Border  Protection, CBP, uses to authenticate travel documents is no better now than on 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The absence of advanced document authentication technology often forces border agents to eyeball travel documents--a makeshift approach that has proven to be inadequate. In 2006, investigators with the Governmental Accountability Office, GAO, were able to enter the United States from Canada and Mexico by showing CBP agents counterfeit drivers' licenses and an expired, altered U.S. diplomatic passport. The GAO used commercially available computer software to produce its travel documents. Amazingly,  the GAO found that it was easier for its investigators to cross into the United States using fake travel documents than during an identical 2003 investigation. The GAO is currently drafting a followup report that will cite automated document authentication technology as a method to improve border security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment requires DHS to develop a pilot program to test automated document authentication technology at various ports of entry within 6 months. This technology is already widely used by domestic agencies, including the Coast Guard, NASA, and the Capitol Police, as well as by foreign governments, such as Australia, Japan, and Sweden. Referring to the 9/11 hijackers, the Commission reported that "analyzing their characteristic travel documents and travel patterns could have allowed authorities  to intercept 4 to 15 hijackers."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must not allow another 9/11. At a time when protecting our homeland against terrorists and other illicit actors remains the paramount national security priority, I believe it is critical that we implement this pilot program to test widely available document authentication technology.</paragraph>
