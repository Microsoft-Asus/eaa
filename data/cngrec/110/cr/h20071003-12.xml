  <narrative>ENSURE THAT FREEDOM AND FAIRNESS REMAIN ON OUR RADIO AIRWAVES--SUPPORT THE BROADCASTER FREEDOM ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11174]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the enmity that exists between American talk radio and the Democratic Congress came into high relief this Monday as leaders in the Senate engaged in repeated and distorted personal attacks of a prominent American commentator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, while many see this as more politics as usual in Washington, DC, I see something more. I believe these attacks on talk radio are a precursor for returning censorship to the airwaves of America in the form of the Fairness Doctrine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week Congressman GREG WALDEN and I requested that the Democratic leaders bring the Broadcaster Freedom Act to the floor of this Congress immediately and take the power away from the FCC in this or any future administration to regulate the airwaves of America. The Broadcaster Freedom Act is cosponsored by 203 Members of Congress, and it enjoys broad bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The freedom of the press should not be a partisan issue. Let's reject the attacks on American radio personalities and ensure that the Fairness Doctrine stays on the ash heap of broadcast history, where it belongs.</paragraph>
