  <narrative>SENATOR TED KENNEDY -- (Senate - May 20, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4444">S4444</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, first of all, let me say this, before we get into Senate business. I made some remarks outside the Senate Chamber, as I always do, following our Tuesday caucus. I had with me Senator CHRIS DODD and Senator JOHN KERRY. The purpose of our being there was to talk about Senator Kennedy; and we did that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amidst the politics and partisanship that takes place in the Senate, the casual observer may not realize how the Senate is a family. We are 100 men and women who work hard during the day, each of us doing our very best to make the country a better place. We argue, we debate, but we approach each other with deep respect and friendship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why, in the heat of battle, I always refer to my Republican counterpart as my friend. That is just not something we do for protocol. That is because MITCH MCCONNELL is my friend. We say that as we proceed through our debates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But just as we, as Senators, celebrate joyous occasions--birthdays, weddings, new children and grandchildren--we also face hardship together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we learned the concerning news about our friend, an American icon, an American legend, Senator TED KENNEDY. I know I speak for every Senator that our thoughts and prayers are with TED and his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had a conversation on the floor with Senator McConnell. He told me during the Republican caucus today they paused to say a prayer for Senator Kennedy, as we did in our caucus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of Senator Kennedy's brothers was killed in combat in World War II. Of course, we all know his brother, President Kennedy, was assassinated. We all know Attorney General Robert Kennedy, Senator Robert Kennedy, was assassinated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said outside, the thing I remember and will always remember about Senator TED KENNEDY is the speech he gave at his brother's funeral. I was not a Member of Congress at that time, but I watched on national television the speech he gave. It was remarkable what he said and how he delivered it. I will never forget that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in addition to that, we know one thing--all of us who know TED KENNEDY--he is a fighter. We have heard this lion roar on the Senate floor on so many occasions. His work ethic is unsurpassed. His effectiveness is legendary. The challenge Senator Kennedy now faces will not be easy, but I think no one is more prepared to fight and beat it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spoke at 1 o'clock to Vicki, his wonderful wife, and she said he has approached this like he does everything: with determination that he is going to beat it. She said he has a bounce in his step today that he has not had in a long time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So he is in good spirits. He is full of energy. If TED happens to be watching on C-SPAN, I want him to know all his brothers and sisters in the Senate are thinking of him, cheering, and praying for him.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Republican conference, at noon today, paused for a prayer for our friend and colleague, TED KENNEDY. As the majority leader has indicated, we are, in spite of our political differences, one large family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Kennedy enjoys great respect and admiration on this side of the aisle. He is, indeed, one of the most important figures to ever serve in this body in our history, and Republican Senators recognize that as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal basis, he came down to the University of Louisville, at my request, a couple years ago to speak to students and the general public on the campus. It was a speech of Presidential quality. He knew I had been an intern in the office of Senator John Sherman Cooper, who represented my State in the Senate for almost 20 years and who was a fast friend of his brother, President Kennedy, and of his. He brought down with him to U of L that day a framed picture of his brother with Senator  Cooper, carefully inscribed at the bottom with the most appropriate inscription you can imagine. He did not miss a thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our prayers go out to Vicki and to the family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of every member of the Republican conference of the Senate, I say to you, TED, you enjoy our admiration and our respect, and our wishes for a speedy recovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
