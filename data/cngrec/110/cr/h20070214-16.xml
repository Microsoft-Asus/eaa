    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly condemn H.Con.Res 63, and the destructive message it sends our troops. Additionally, it sends a message that emboldens the very terrorists we are fighting to prevent another 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The debate over this resolution makes America appear weak in her resolve to win the war on terror. We have seen terrorism all across the globe, from bombings in Spain, to London and Bali.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America is fighting radical Islamic jihadists, an enemy that poses a threat of colossal proportions. They will stop at nothing to follow their twisted version of Islam and to pursue the destruction of Israel and Western civilization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I stand here with the firm resolve and pledge to protect my country and future generations from terrorism. I took an oath and have a constitutional obligation as a Member of Congress to protect and defend America from all enemies, foreign or domestic. This is an obligation all Members of Congress share, and it simply escapes me how some of my colleagues fail to understand the dire consequences of leaving Iraq.</paragraph>
