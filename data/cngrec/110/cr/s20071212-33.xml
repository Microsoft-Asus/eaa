    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with the greatest pleasure that I rise today to honor the University of Central Arkansas for its 100th anniversary. The university is located in Conway, AR, which lies in the central part of my State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Central Arkansas began as the Arkansas State Normal School under the leadership of John James Doyne in 1907. In 1909, the first commencement ceremony was held to recognize 10 graduates. The school conferred its first baccalaureate degree in 1922 and was renamed Arkansas State Teachers College in 1925.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The school was renamed State College of Arkansas in 1967, but was granted university status and renamed as the University of Central Arkansas in 1975. Since then, UCA has continued to excel by establishing the State's first Honors College, joining the National Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA, and beginning its first doctoral program in 1998. Currently, the University of Central Arkansas has more than 100 undergraduate courses of study, 33 master's degree programs, and 3 doctoral programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Arkansas has always made education a top priority and the University of Central Arkansas has a proud history of scholastic progress. The university is an integral part of the Arkansas community and the educational opportunities available provide graduates with the skills needed to succeed in today's workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating the University of Central Arkansas on its 100th anniversary and in wishing the university another 100 years of success.</paragraph>
