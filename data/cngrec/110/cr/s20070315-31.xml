    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to an exceptional man who is retiring in July, after 19 years of impeccable service to the George Washington University, GW.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, 68, became the 15th president of GW on August 1, 1988. A native of Brooklyn, NY, President Trachtenberg earned a bachelor of arts degree from Columbia University in 1959, the juris doctor from Yale University in 1962, and the master of public administration degree from Harvard University in 1966. In 1968, he was selected as a Winston Churchill Traveling Fellow for study in Oxford, England.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He came to GW from the University of Hartford, Connecticut, where he had been president for 11 years. Before assuming the presidency of Hartford, President Trachtenberg served for 8 years at Boston University as vice president for academic services and academic dean of the college of liberal arts. Earlier, in Washington, DC, he was a special assistant for 2 years to the U.S. Education Commissioner, Department of Health, Education and Welfare. He has been an attorney with the U.S. Atomic Energy  Commission and a legislative aide to former Indiana Congressman John Brademas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just a few of the highlights in his career include the following: President Trachtenberg was named one of the top 100 leaders in the American Academy in a 1978 Change magazine poll. He received a 1987 Human Relations Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews. In 1988, the Connecticut Bar Association honored him with its Distinguished Public Service Award, and he was recognized by the Hartford NAACP for his contributions to the education of minority students. In 1992, he received  the Hannah G. Solomon Award from the National Council of Jewish Women. In 1993, the Washington, DC, Urban League named him "Father of the Year." And in 1992 and 2007, he received the Martin Luther King, Jr. Awards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Trachtenberg has served the GW community as a drum major for change and has lead by example a commitment to public, civic, and personal service. Throughout the years, he has worked tirelessly in honoring and enhancing the symbiotic relationship between the University and the District of Columbia, supporting and mentoring students, and leading and advocating for reinvention, change, and civic engagement. He has worked successfully for almost two decades to propel GW further into the  first ranks of world-class institutions of higher learning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of President Trachtenberg's efforts, the number of applications for undergraduate admission more than tripled, from 6,000 in 1988 to almost 20,000 in 2006, while the university's acceptance rate of these applicants was reduced by two-thirds. President Trachtenberg made financial aid for students a priority so that today the university offers nearly nine times, $113 million, as much financial aid to incoming students as was offered in 1988.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It can confidently be said that the university's faculty now comprises experts on topics ranging from administrative law to zoology and contribute to scholarly journals, law reviews, and media outlets on a regular basis. The university's sponsored research enterprise has quadrupled from $33 million in expenditures in 1988 to $132 million in expenditures in 2006. Through President Trachtenberg's efforts, GW has significantly upgraded its information technology and library system which now contains  more than 2,000,000 volumes and is a member of the prestigious Association of Research Libraries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under President Trachtenberg's unprecedented leadership, the university robustly developed academic, residential, and recreational facilities on campus--including the opening of the Media and Public Affairs Building and the establishment within of the Luther W. Brady Art Gallery in 2001, the Annette and Theodore Lerner Health and Wellness Center in 2001, GW Hospital in 2002, 1957 E Street, the new home of GW's Elliott School of International Affairs and Geography Department in 2002, and Ric and  Dawn Duques Hall, the new home of GW's Business School in 2006--in a way that served the institution's scholarly and other programmatic needs while respecting the interests of its Foggy Bottom neighbors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Trachtenberg's commitment to the enhancement of academic and other space on campus supported the renovation and expansion of the law school complex, begun in 2000 and completed in 2006, the renovation of Morton and Norma Lee Funger Hall, dedicated in February 2006, and improvements of the Cloyd Heck Marvin Center including the addition of the Marc C. Abrahms Great Hall, dedicated in December 2002, and the renovation of J Street dining facilities, opened August 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Trachtenberg also spearheaded a campus beautification effort that transformed a series of city streets into a cohesive and vibrant urban campus with the addition of the Mid-Campus Quad, Kogan Plaza, pocket parks, and outdoor sculptures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Trachtenberg presides over the District of Columbia's largest private employer. And to support all the foregoing, President Trachtenberg oversaw two decades of balanced budgets, and the increase in the university endowment from $200 million in 1988 to more than $1 billion in 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1989, President Trachtenberg created the 21st Century DC Scholars Program, now the Stephen Joel Trachtenberg Scholars, which has granted almost 100 full scholarships, representing over $13 million, to students from the DC Public Schools to attend GW. Under Trachtenberg's leadership, GW's Multicultural Student Services Center was named and has become a strong center for cultural awareness and celebrations, student development, and diversity training. Additionally, the Office of Community Service  was created in 1992 and has become a focal point for civic engagement for the Washington DC community. His dedication to civic service is reflected throughout the university, which was named a "college with a conscience" in 2005 by Princeton Review, and most recently in the top 10 schools sending students to the Peace Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His passion and demonstrated commitment to DC--the city, the schools, the business community and its residents--are unparalleled and have been recognized on several occasions by the District of Columbia Mayor, City Council and Chamber of Commerce. President Trachtenberg has received numerous accolades from across the Nation and abroad for his service, vision, intellect, wit, and compassion. Thanks to President Trachtenberg, GW went from being one of the best kept secrets in town to being one  of the best known and most admired global universities.</paragraph>
