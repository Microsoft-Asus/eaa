  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we approach Independence Day, I am grateful for the success of our troops in Iraq and in Afghanistan to protect American families by defeating terrorists overseas. With two sons who have served in Iraq and my former National Guard 218th Brigade in Afghanistan, I know firsthand our military's accomplishments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Defense reports violence in Iraq has declined significantly. Security incidents have fallen to their lowest level in 4 years. Civilian deaths are down 75 percent from a year ago, with the Iraqi military taking greater control over military operations against al Qaeda and Iranian-backed militias.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increased security has led to increased political and economic progress where Iraqis are sharing oil revenues, are developing and implementing a budget, and are taking greater financial responsibility for building their infrastructure. We should recognize these achievements to eliminate terrorist safe havens so our decisions here in Washington do not reverse this progress, which would threaten our allies and American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
