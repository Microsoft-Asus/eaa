  <narrative>HONORING SENATOR TRENT LOTT -- (Senate - December 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="15794">S15794</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I have publicly stated my feelings about TRENT LOTT on a number of occasions since he indicated he was going to retire by the end of this year. We had a lovely reception for him in the Mansfield Room. Other people have their own views as to the strengths of TRENT LOTT, but having worked with him here on the Senate floor for these many years, his greatest attribute can best be summarized by the statesman Edmund Burke:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All government ..... every virtue and every prudent act--is founded on compromise .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not negative. That is positive. Compromise is something we as legislators must do. Legislation is the art of compromise. That is what we have been taught, and that is the way it is. There is no better example of that than what we have before us now or should have in a short time from the House, the omnibus spending bill. That has been the epitome of compromise by legislators and by the White House as the executive. That is what TRENT LOTT did best, approaching a difficult issue,  trying to figure a way out of it. No one who has ever legislated and gotten a bill passed with their name on it has had what they really started out to do. We all must compromise. That is a negative term in some people's mind, but it really isn't if you are a legislator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The special skill Trent Lott has, the special kind of understanding and pursuit of the common good, requires us to find common ground. Trent Lott embodies that skill. He is a true legislator. In all my dealings with Trent Lott, he is a gentleman. I have never, ever had Senator Lott say something to me that he was not able to carry through on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His commitments are as good as gold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had some jokes here about his dealings with John Breaux. They have a lot of qualities, but their qualities were the ability to make deals. When we needed something done during the Daschle years, the first person we went to was John Breaux. I am confident the first person he went to was TRENT LOTT. They have been close personal friends for all these years. As a result of their friendship, their trust of one another, it kind of spilled off on the rest of us, and we were able to get  a lot of work done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It goes without saying that we disagree on policy often, Senator Lott and I, but with TRENT, these disagreements never seemed to be that important because he was always able to approach these challenges with a genuine desire to find a solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The history books will be written about this institution. I am confident they will be written about the State of Mississippi. There will be chapters that will have to be dedicated to TRENT LOTT because he has been part of the history of the State of Mississippi and of this institution and the House of Representatives. No one has ever, in the history of our country, some 230 years, served as the House whip and the Senate whip, but TRENT LOTT has. I believe he has made our country  more secure in many ways. When we talk about security, it doesn't mean necessarily the military because our security depends on a lot more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lott, I wish you and your wonderful wife and your family the very best. I believe my dealings with you have made me a better person and a better Senator.</paragraph>
