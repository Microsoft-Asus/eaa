    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, earlier this week I hosted a screening of a documentary entitled, "India's Hidden Slavery," a film about contemporary slavery in India among the 250 million Dalits or untouchables.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The caste system has at the top the Brahmin or priestly class, the ruling class. That includes politicians. At the very bottom, not even considered a caste because they're too low, the Dalits. Today, in the world's largest democracy, an unknown hidden system exists with people without basic human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In contrast to the economic progress in some sectors in Indian society, below the surface is a society still racked by caste, with millions suffering and held hostage to a social structure that reinforces segregation, poverty, injustice and slavery. Recently, village leaders just condemned to death a couple that married outside their caste.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the government of India has taken some small steps to outlaw the caste system, in reality, it permeates every aspect of life there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend India for its economic progress, but I urge government leaders to ensure that all people in India have basic human rights, and especially the 250 million Dalits.</paragraph>
