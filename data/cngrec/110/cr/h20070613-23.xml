    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Americans are growing frustrated. A recent Los Angeles Times poll placed Congress' approval ratings at the lowest point they have been in a decade, 27 percent down from 36 percent in January. And based on the many calls that my office receives every day, that frustration is largely embodied in the immigration issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, for the last 2 weeks, I have received numerous calls from my constituents asking where is the border fence. Well, Mr. Speaker, that's a good question. Where is the border fence? Last night and early this morning, while this Chamber was debating a Homeland Security funding bill, that contains no funding specifically for fencing, hundreds of people were able to make their way across the border or were trafficked into America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while we would like to believe that every single person made their way in order to seek out a better life for themselves or their family, we know that is not always the case. Some, as evidenced by the plot to attack Fort Dix, are here to harm us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would impress upon the majority to do the right thing.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
