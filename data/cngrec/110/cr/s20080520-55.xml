  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize Dr. Charles Ruch, outgoing president of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology in Rapid City who is retiring after 5 years of service to the university.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The School of Mines was established in 1885 and enjoys a nationwide reputation for excellence in engineering, the sciences, and computer technology. President Ruch has received praise from the South Dakota Board of Regents for his keen focus on the academic, research and public service missions at the university. Since his arrival in 2003, the number of doctoral programs has doubled and the awards for research-related grants and contracts have increased 35 percent in the last 4 years to $17.2  million. Under his tenure, a new business incubator on campus has created important links between higher education, economic development and the Black Hills region. Additionally, under his visionary leadership, the School of Mines has conducted "cutting edge" defense research</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His leadership and dedication to the School of Mines will be greatly missed. It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Dr. Ruch on a successful career in higher education and wish him the best on his retirement.</paragraph>
