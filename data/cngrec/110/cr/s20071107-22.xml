  <narrative>HONORING DR. WILLIAM POTTER -- (Senate - November 07, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14058">S14058</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to commemorate the awarding of the first endowed professorship in the field of nonproliferation studies to my friend, Dr. William Potter. Bill has served as director of the Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. In that post he has made valuable contributions to U.S. policy through detailed analysis of the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, comprehensive program-&#xD0;matic reviews  of efforts to address the threat, and training of arms control and nonproliferation experts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill Potter has an unequaled research and academic record in the field of nonproliferation. He has served as a consultant to the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the RAND Corporation. In addition, he has served for a number of years on the United Nations Secretary General's Advisory Board on Disarmament Research. He has written or edited 14 books and contributed to more than 90 books or journals. He has also made Monterey's quarterly publication, "The Nonproliferation Review," the leading  journal in the field of nonproliferation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored that Monterey Institute has named Dr. Potter's new position the "Nunn-Lugar chair of nonproliferation studies." In 1991, Sam Nunn and I believed that our Government had to act to address the threats posed by the dissolution of the Soviet Union. As political and military leaders inched away from Cold War standoffs, the weapons they had developed to threaten and deter each other remained capable of killing the entire American population and rendering our country a wasteland.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="14059">S14059</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sam and I worked closely with experts and friends like Bill Potter. Together we understood that a unilateral effort would not succeed and challenged the United States and our former enemies to work together. The United States needed a diplomatic strategy and a programmatic response to the threat. The Nunn-Lugar program was our answer. The program succeeded in convincing Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan to remove all nuclear weapons from their territories. In addition, it became the primary tool  through which the United States continues to work with Russia to destroy its massive nuclear, chemical, and biological warfare capacity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could relate many stories and experiences I have enjoyed with Bill Potter. His patient diplomacy and leadership have made important contributions to U.S. national security and international peace. The education, policy information, and policy expertise he will provide through his new position to the students at the Monterey Institute will continue the grand tradition he has established there and ensure that his talents and dedication are continued in a fine academic tradition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was and remains the No. 1 national security threat facing the United States and the international community. We still have a lot of work to do to address the threats posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I congratulate the university and Dr. Potter on this important announcement and look forward to continuing my close relationship with Bill and his colleagues at Monterey as we work together to address the threat posed by the  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</paragraph>
