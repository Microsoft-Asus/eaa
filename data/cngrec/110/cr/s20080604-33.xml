    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor the city of Gettysburg, SD, and to recognize the 125th anniversary of its founding. Situated in Potter County, Gettysburg's history and success is a testament to the great State of South Dakota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gettysburg was settled in 1883 by 200 Civil War veterans, thus sharing its name with the historical Pennsylvania battle. In fact, many street, township, and community names in Potter County mimic Civil War history. The Chicago and Northwestern Railroads were a significant boost to the Gettysburg economy, and promoted a thriving agricultural and economic community. Gettysburg even boasts of the first swimming pool in the State of South Dakota being nearby.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 125th anniversary celebration will be held June 27-29, kicking off with an all class reunion. The festivities include a parade, ping-pong ball drop, antique car show, and banquet. For activities outside the celebration weekend, the Gettysburg Country Club's fantastic golf course and Dakota Sunset Museum are a testament to the city's progressive nostalgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it has been my honor to represent the citizens of Gettysburg as a Member of Congress since 1986. I am proud to publicly recognize Gettysburg and congratulate the community on this achievement. As the people of Gettysburg take this opportunity to appreciate how far the city has come from its beginnings, I know they will understand the important role Gettysburg plays in making South Dakota the great State that it is.</paragraph>
