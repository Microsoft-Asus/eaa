  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there are 43,000 men and women working as transportation security officers, or TSOs, for the Transportation Security Administration. They deserve our respect, not our indifference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The McCaskill amendment is straightforward. It provides TSOs basic rights and protections in the workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The DeMint amendment, however, strips away those rights and protections. Proponents have raised specious arguments about the consequences of providing worker protections to people whose job it is to protect us. In fact, the opposite is true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The McCaskill amendment helps ensure that a screening system intended to prevent acts of terrorism actually prevents acts of terrorism. If we want TSOs to protect our health and safety, we should protect theirs. For the sake of screeners and travelers both, TSOs should not be overworked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the sake of screeners and travelers both, TSOs should not fear retaliation if they report security breaches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the sake of screeners and travelers both, TSOs should have somewhere to turn if they are being harassed or bullied at the workplace or if there are health and safety issues in the workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Basic rights, basic common sense. That is what the McCaskill amendment is about. It doesn't give TSOs the right to strike. It does not compromise the public safety. Actually, it promotes the public safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge every Member of this body to allow TSOs the same basic rights and privileges and protections as other Federal employees. Vote yes on the McCaskill amendment because you care about these workers, and vote yes because you care about all of us, the people they are protecting.</paragraph>
