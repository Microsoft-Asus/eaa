    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will be necessarily absent from voting today as I will be on official business in my district, hosting a Cabinet Secretary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Had I been present to vote, I would have voted "aye" on the amendment offered by Representatives Lewis, Welch and Weller to prevent CMS from making deep cuts in hospital payments for one year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former Board Member of Planned Parenthood Los Angeles, I would have voted "no" on Representative Pence's amendment to prohibit funds for Planned Parenthood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would have also voted for the bill's final passage.</paragraph>
