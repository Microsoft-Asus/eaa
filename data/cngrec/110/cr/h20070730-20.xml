    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="31">H.R. 31</bill> will help the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District build a recycled water treatment and distribution system. This fast-growing area in southern California is heavily dependent on water from rivers and storage reservoirs that are hundreds of miles away. The modest financial assistance provided by <bill type="h" number="31">H.R. 31</bill> will help southern California reduce its reliance on imported water and help to sustain water supplies during droughts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have no objection to this non-controversial bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</paragraph>
