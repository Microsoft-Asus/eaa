  <narrative>TAX REBATE RELIEF -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H374]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is all too rare when we in the majority and the President arrive at a consensus. So it's welcome news that we agree on relief Americans need in today's economy should come in the form of a stimulus bill. Targeted tax breaks and short-term measures to help the middle class can salvage our economy from plummeting home values, savings and market conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should insist upon including expanded unemployment benefits and food stamps, in addition to tax rebates. These benefits will be spent immediately by those who need our help most in this economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, for every dollar spent by the government on food stamps, there is a $1.60 return to the economy; and for every dollar spent on unemployment benefits, the return is $1.90.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tax rebate should be targeted to the middle class and include those low-income workers who didn't earn enough to pay income taxes but still pay into Medicare and Social Security through payroll taxes withheld from their paychecks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the prescription middle-class Americans need to cure the ills of today's economy. Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to do their part to help us towards that end.</paragraph>
