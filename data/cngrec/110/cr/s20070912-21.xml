  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I wish to recognize the Carlsbad Medical Center for reaching its 30th birthday. I had the pleasure of being the keynote speaker during the dedication ceremony in 1977. Since then, the hospital has grown and weathered many changes over the last 30 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The medical field has experienced many advances and changes in the past three decades. New technology has brought many new ways of treating patients. Technology has increased the number of patients served and helped to increase test accuracy. The future will bring many more medical advances, and I am certain this facility will be ready for anything that comes its way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Carlsbad Medical Center has aged gracefully and along the way has helped thousands of patients in need. It has been an honor to watch this facility and the progress they have made over the last 30 years. I look forward to another 30 years of growth.</paragraph>
