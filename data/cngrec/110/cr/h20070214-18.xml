  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we continue the debate of opposing reinforcements for American forces in the global war on terrorism, I am reminded of how crucial it is that we achieve victory to protect American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current situation in Iraq reminds me of a smoldering fire in an urban area. Proper equipment and a sufficient number of professional firefighters are brought in to put out the fire. To sit back, overlook the seriousness or leave the scene of the fire only enables the fire to grow, become more intense and spread throughout the neighborhood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This analogy is applicable to Iraq. As Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said recently, the violence in Iraq, if unchecked, could spread outside its borders and draw other states into a regional conflagration. Just as we know our fire chiefs would call up additional firefighters to contain a spreading fire, we must give our troops in Baghdad the chance to suppress violence and stabilize the region, which protects American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
