  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hill) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400177" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, I had the opportunity to introduce, I think, a very important bill. And for those who are listening in your offices, I hope other Members of Congress who have not gone home yet will take the opportunity to review this bill and join me as a co-author of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the campaign last year, there were many issues that we talked about: energy independence, health care, the Nation's budget. But one that emerged as a very, very important issue was the issue of ethics in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People were very disturbed at all the scandals that were going on in this great body, and they told me over and over and over again that Congress needed to clean up its act. And they are right. We did. And we do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It pains me that the American public does not have a whole lot of faith in this institution because I love the House of Representatives. It is indeed an honor and privilege for me to serve in this great Chamber. In spite of all the arguments that we have here, democracy works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember, Mr. Speaker, that Dick Gephardt once told me that the arguments that we have here in this great body is a replacement for war. And that, in fact, is the case. This system, even while it gets ugly at times, is a great system that we have in this great country. We love our country and we love our government because the government is here to serve the people. And when it doesn't act right, we need to do something about it. We need to restore the confidence of the House of Representatives  back to the people of the United States. And in that I introduced a bill to try to restore that confidence again by the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill that I have introduced will replace the present Ethics Committee as we know it today. Right now, the Ethics Committee consists of sitting Members of Congress, and it is very difficult for colleagues to investigate fellow colleagues. It is just naturally very difficult. This bill will replace that committee system with former Members of Congress who are not lobbyists, giving people like, let's say, Lee Hamilton an opportunity to serve in this capacity, who can kind of take a step away  from the Members and do the investigations that have to be done so that we can restore honor and integrity to this great body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is a good idea. I have talked to several Members and already have several Members who have become co-authors with me on this important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be six members appointed by the Speaker on the Democratic side and six members appointed by the Republicans, by the majority leader, on their side. They will serve for no longer than three terms. But they will have the opportunity to do the job that sitting Members cannot do. So I think it is a very important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to make sure that the people who are on this committee have institutional knowledge of this great body. And as former Members who are not lobbyists, they have that institutional knowledge to do the work that has to be done, which is so difficult to be done now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So I hope those who are listening on their television sets and their offices  here in Washington, DC will take the opportunity to call my office to get on this bill and start the process of restoring confidence and integrity to the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
