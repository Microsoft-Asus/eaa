    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in the week before we adjourned for the holidays, Congress, in a bipartisan effort, passed, and the President signed, the Energy Independence and Security Act. This bill, which is now law, represents a major stride forward towards a clean energy future. I applaud my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for moving this historic and very important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was a good first step, but we are not there yet. The real meat of an effective energy package, which was not included in the legislation, must be the extension of critical tax incentives. These are essential for the solar industry to really take root and flourish. This is one of the reasons why I introduced <bill type="h" number="3807">H.R. 3807</bill>, the Renewable Energy Assistance Act, to improve and extend vital tax incentives for solar energy. These incentives will spur innovation, decrease our carbon emissions, and reduce  our dependency on foreign energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this time of economic uncertainty, it is important that we provide this critical stimulus so that we can move forward on these renewable energy efforts. We have to act this year, before the end of 2008. Doing so will get America back on track and working toward a better and brighter future.</paragraph>
