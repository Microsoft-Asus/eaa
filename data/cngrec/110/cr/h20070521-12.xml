  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the incredible sacrifice, patriotism and valor of the life of Captain Larry Bauguess of Moravian Falls, North Carolina. Captain Bauguess, an officer in the 82nd Airborne, fell in the line of duty last week as he left a meeting on the Pakistan and Afghanistan border and came under enemy fire. He was a man of true courage and principle who served our Nation with distinction with the United States Army since 1993.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a man who not only knew the value of liberty but also cherished his family, never taking their love or respect for granted. He will be remembered as a paratrooper of great valor, impeccable honor and tremendous faith, a father who gave his children an unblemished legacy, a husband of unflagging commitment, a son who evoked the greatest pride.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Bauguess is survived by his wife, Wesley, and two daughters, Ryann and Ellie. His absence leaves a hole in the Bauguess family, the 82nd Airborne and in his community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am confident that he will long be remembered as a man who knew the meaning of sacrifice and the call of duty to family and country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my thoughts and my prayers are with Captain Bauguess' wife, daughters and extended family. May they sense God's comforting presence during this trying time. Our Nation is blessed to call him an honored son. We pledge our commitment to the family he left behind, and we mourn his passing.</paragraph>
