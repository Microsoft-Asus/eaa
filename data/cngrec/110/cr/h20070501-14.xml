    <paragraph>Today is the fourth anniversary of the President of the United States announcing "Mission Accomplished." It is also the day of the publication of a book called "The Life and Times of Warren Zevon," a biography of a dear friend of mine who was a late, great singer/song writer. I wanted to address both topics, and I think I can do it together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four years ago, when the President announced "Mission Accomplished," he was right if he was talking about Saddam Hussein's government being toppled; but otherwise, he was wrong and he has been channeling Warren Zevon who said, "I'm caught between a rock and a hard place. Send lawyers, guns, and money. The Shiites have hit the fan."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Warren Zevon, requiescat in pace. Mr. President, please sign the bill the Congress has given you to end this war, to end the occupation, and to bring our troops home.</paragraph>
