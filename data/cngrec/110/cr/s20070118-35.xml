    <paragraph>Madam President, today I mourn the passing and pay tribute to a wonderful Georgian and a personal friend. Thomas Watson Brown passed away on January 13, 2007, leaving a tremendous void in the hearts of all who knew and loved this extraordinary gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although he was a longtime resident of Marietta, GA, Tom was actually born here in our Nation's Capital where he attended Saint Alban's School. He graduated magna cum laude from Princeton with a degree in history and served a stint in the U.S. Army. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1959 and moved to Atlanta where he practiced law until his death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Tom was not originally from Georgia, his family had deep Georgia roots. His great-grandfather was U.S. Senator Tom Watson, who  was nominated in 1896 for Vice President on the Populist Party ticket with William Jennings Bryan. Brown's grandfather, J.J. Brown, served as Georgia's commissioner of agriculture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom was a character unlike any other. He often described himself as an "18th-century gentleman" and held court in his antebellum mansion on Cherokee Street near the Marietta Square arguing politics with a host of different personalities. History was his greatest passion, especially the Civil War era. He had an unmatched intellect and was a respected historian. He preferred his 10,000-volume library to a personal computer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom was also always ready to support education. He was the former chair of the Watson-Brown Foundation, established by his father Walter Brown in 1970 to provide college opportunities for underprivileged boys and girls. Today his son Tad is president of the foundation, which awards more than $1 million annually in merit- and need-based college scholarships to students from the Central Savannah River Area of Georgia and South Carolina. The foundation also gives grants in support of southern colleges  and universities. Recipients of these grants include the University of Georgia for a broadcast museum, Georgia College and State University in Milledgeville for its library, and Mercer Press in Macon for publications of numerous books of Southern history and biography.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom led numerous business, civic, philanthropic, and scholarly organizations. He served on the boards of the Atlanta Historical Society, the Georgia Historical Society, the Georgia Civil War Commission, the Atlanta Legal Aid Society, and the Georgia Legal History Foundation. He was also an enthusiastic supporter of the Atlanta Press Club and helped fund its debates each election cycle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom was awarded the Martin Luther King, Jr., Center's community service award for peace and justice. Coretta Scott King herself presented him with the award for his substantial contributions to and support of the Legal Aid Society of Atlanta.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This strong-willed and generous man will always be remembered for his keen intellect and his devotion to history and education. He touched the lives of many Georgians, including this Senator, through his efforts on behalf of our community and State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was an honor to know Thomas Watson Brown and it is a privilege to pay tribute to his life.</paragraph>
