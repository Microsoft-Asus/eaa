  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="REMEMBERING JACK B. WEIL">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to make note of the recent passing of Jack B. Weil of Denver, CO. I knew Jack personally. That puts me in the company of thousands. The passing of Jack B. Weil is not only a loss for his family, but it is a loss for the city of Denver and the State of Colorado, so I wanted to share a bit about Jack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack was born on Nov 13, 1928, at Denver's Mercy Hospital. He graduated from Tulane University in 1952 and entered the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant, thus beginning a life of service to causes greater than himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1954, Jack joined the firm founded by his father, Rockmount Ranch Wear Manufacturing Company, where he worked until illness forced him to retire last year. While at Rockmount, Jack used his artistic flair to create many signature designs which have become icons of western shirt design. In fact his "Sawtooth" pocket and "diamond" snap design is the longest running shirt design in America, and it sits in a collection at the Smithsonian. Rockmount shirts have been worn by working cowboys,  rodeo cowboys and the likes of Ronald Reagan, Elvis, Eric Clapton, Robert Redford, and more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack was active in his community throughout his life. He supported higher education for all and served as the longtime chairman of the Foundation for the Community College of Denver. He supported the cause of historic preservation, even buying one of Denver's historic homes and fighting to preserve the historic character of the Humboldt Island neighborhood. He opened that same home for fundraisers for a wide spectrum of causes, including charitable and political ones. An accomplished artist,  his abstract paintings provided pleasure to many people and were displayed in local galleries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the political front, Jack was proof that one could have strong convictions yet treat those with divergent views with respect and dignity. He never hesitated to state his views and he actively supported them by his involvement and leadership with various political organizations. When discussions would get too heated, Jack was quick with a wry comment or offcolor joke to break the tension and remind everyone of their commonalities, not their differences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the very end, Jack served others. He spent the past 2-plus years as the cochair of the USS Mesa Verde commissioning team. In that role, Jack supported the crew of this brand new Navy ship with both his time and his money. Despite his flagging health, he even attended the commissioning ceremony in Florida this past December to demonstrate his support of our brave sailors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But you can not capture the essence of Jack B. Weil in his accomplishments. No, the true essence of Jack is captured in the lives he touched. You see, Jack Weil loved people. Be it buying someone who was having a bad day an ice cream cone or inviting people he had just met over to his house, Jack demonstrated a heart for people that we all would do well to follow. He made friends wherever he went and always offered words of encouragement to those who needed them. This is best demonstrated by  the volume of e-mails, phone calls, and letters that his family has received from all over the world offering their condolences and stories of how Jack touched them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though Jack moved in circles with the rich and powerful, he was completely unaffected by it. His son tells a story of Jack mentioning one day how he had sold some shirts to "some British musician ..... David something ..... Bowie," which his son thought was another one of Jack's jokes until he received a call from David Bowie's assistant the next day to order more shirts. Or the time Jack shared some laughs at a club with Robin Williams while having no idea who he was. That was how Jack was.  It didn't matter if you were famous or powerful or a cleaning lady or a bartender, to Jack you were just his friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a line from a poem that all cadets at West Point learn that I think says it best: And when our course on earth is run, may it be said, "Well Done, be thou at peace." Well Done, Jack.</paragraph>
