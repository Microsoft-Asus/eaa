    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, despite promises that are only 6 months old, the cause of cleaning up the Congress has ground to a halt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should kill pensions for Members of Congress convicted of a felony. And after passing a shadow bill in January, this action has completely stalled. No action in February, March, April, May or June.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the real surprise. Despite promises of spending reform, Congressional leaders blocked efforts to stop funding the construction of the bridges to nowhere. That's right. Democratic leaders in Congress now support building the bridges to nowhere, one structure, connecting to an island with just 50 people, the other to an island with only 22, at a cost to the U.S. taxpayer of over $1 billion. Only 6 months into a new Congress, and now Congressional leaders do not want to kill pensions for Congressional  felons, but do want to build the bridges to nowhere.</paragraph>
