  <narrative>CHINA -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H3112]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. WOLF asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400435" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my frustration and disappointment with the leadership's decision to bypass the Appropriations Committee and to bring up the 2008 supplemental without giving Members an opportunity either on the floor or in the committee to offer an amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to offer an amendment to prohibit U.S. Government employees from attending the Beijing Olympics on the taxpayers' dime because of China's violent repression of religious minorities and human rights activists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Catholics, Protestants, Tibetan Buddhists, Uyghur Muslims, Falun Gong practitioners and other religious minorities in China face harassment, imprisonment, even torture and death. China is actively engaging in espionage against our country and now participating in a genocide in Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The political prisoners in China and the dissidents around the world will be deeply demoralized if senior American officials attend the games.</paragraph>
