  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to add my voice to those of my colleagues who have stood to salute the Peace Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Peace Corps is one of our country's most effective international development programs. Since its inception in 1961, the Peace Corps has sent over 190,000 volunteers to 139 developing countries, where they have helped build thousands of schools, health clinics, and small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Equally as important, the Peace Corps is one of our country's most important public diplomacy programs. The sight of ordinary Americans volunteering to serve the world's most disadvantaged populations cannot help but elevate good will toward our country. Fifty-nine volunteers from my home State of New Mexico are currently serving in countries ranging from Ukraine and Georgia in Europe, to Malawi and Senegal in Africa, to Peru and Honduras in Central America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I urge the Peace Corps to consider returning to the poorest country in our own hemisphere. That country is Haiti.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the U.N. Development Program, over three-quarters of Haitians subsist on less than $2 per day and over half on less than $1 per day. Haiti is one of the poorest of the poor. The security situation in Haiti was precarious for much of the new century--which is why the Peace Corps left. But one year ago, a brighter picture emerged. The international community launched a concerted effort to rid Haiti's slums of violent gangs. President Rene Preval made real efforts to promote political  reconciliation in the country. Because of these efforts, we have a genuine window of opportunity to make a difference in Haiti. But this window will not last forever. In the best tradition of the Peace Corps, we Americans should seize this opportunity while we have the chance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can think of no better way of honoring the Peace Corps than by calling upon it to consider returning to Haiti.</paragraph>
