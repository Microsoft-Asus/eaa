  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on January 31, 2008, the Senate Librarian, Mr. Greg Harness, will retire. With his departure, we will lose a dedicated, loyal, and very important member of the Senate family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate Library is a fundamental part of the U.S. Senate. Operating under the direction of the Secretary of the Senate, the Senate Library serves as both a legislative and general reference library, and provides a wide variety of information services to Senators and our staffs in a prompt and timely fashion. It maintains a comprehensive collection of congressional and governmental publications and of materials relating to the specialized needs of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The origins of this unique and important institution date back to 1792, when the Senate directed the Secretary "to procure and deposit in his office, the laws of the states, for the use of the Senate." The first Senate Librarian to be appointed was George S. Wagner, who officially commenced his duties on July 1, 1871.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1997, Greg Harness became the 17th Senate Librarian. A native of North Dakota, Mr. Harness began work in the Senate Library on October 20, 1975, as a reference librarian. He planned to work only a few years in Washington and then return to North Dakota to attend law school. Fortunately, his plans changed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Harness continued his employment in the Senate Library for the next 32 years. As a reference librarian, Mr. Harness was a wonderful and pleasant person with whom to work. He undertook every request, no matter how large or small, how urgent or demanding, whether from the majority or the minority, and answered it effectively, professionally, and promptly. He always took that extra step to ensure that the Senator or his staff member received the best, the most accurate, and the most recent information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Senate Librarian, Mr. Harness directed the administrative and professional operations of the Senate Library. He oversaw the movement of the Library from the Capitol to the Russell Building in 1999 and oversaw the design of the new Senate Library. More important, he continued that same cooperative, helpful attitude that he had always displayed as a reference librarian. As a result, he set a model of superior service for his entire staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Harness for his years of loyalty to the Senate, as well as his dedicated and distinguished service. And, I want him to know that my staff and I will certainly miss him. I wish him happiness and success as he enters the next phase of his life.</paragraph>
