  <narrative>FUNDING THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR HOMETOWN SECURITY BY EARMARK -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6715]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight an earmark in the fiscal 2009 Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. Now, the reason I'm having to do this is that it looks like we won't even be considering this bill on the floor, and therefore, it may be that all of the earmarks, the hundreds of earmarks that were approved in the committee for that bill, may be dumped into the bill, just air-dropped into the bill, at the last minute without even being considered by the House.  That's simply not right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This earmark is for the Kentucky-based National Institute for Hometown Security. When I came across this earmark, I was surprised at the dollar amount. In fact, it was the second largest earmark requested by an individual in the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. Now, I would submit that spending like this pushes the Federal Treasury threat level past orange, or high risk, right into the red zone, or severe category.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Web site of the earmark recipient, the institute sponsor suggested organizing the higher education institutions of Kentucky to more effectively compete for research funds and projects aimed at improving homeland security. It appears that the purpose of the consortium and of the institute is to make Kentucky better at receiving Federal funds, arguably an admirable purpose. It's simply too bad that it's paid for with Federal funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The institute goes on to say that the institute is designed to help develop new technologies and devices that commercialize them. Now, with taxpayers shouldering over $5 trillion in Federal debt, why do we need to fund programs for the benefit of commercializing products?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This institute was created in 2004. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the agency which is charged with overseeing this, the Department has never requested funds for the National Institute for Hometown Security. Why are we doing this through an earmark?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must ask the question: Would this institute exist in the first place if select members of a powerful committee did not direct the spending for it?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since receiving its first earmark, the institute has received more than $60 million in Federal earmarks, including $12 million in 2005, $20 million in 2006, $20 million in 2007, $11 million in 2008. If this earmark is approved, the institute will have received $74 million in earmark funding. For what? What has the center produced or achieved that can possibly be worth this kind of money? Will we continue to earmark for this institute indefinitely?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am certain, if I had the opportunity to challenge this earmark on the House floor during regular order, the sponsor might be glad to highlight what he believes the institute's achievements are. My response would simply be: If this institute is so important, if it's so needed for the Department of Homeland Security, why do you have to earmark funding for it? Why doesn't the Department seek its own funding and say this is a vital institute? "We ought to provide funding within the budget. We're  going to request it." No. The money has to be earmarked by an appropriator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, a Washington Post story provided details on the institute. It indicated that the sponsor of the earmark has, as a senior appropriator, "encouraged contractors to move into his district and has announced millions of dollars in antiterrorism research at Kentucky colleges and universities."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That same article highlighted the sponsor's having taken credit for $206 million in homeland security research-related funding for the State. The Post article indicated: "So much Federal money for high-tech homeland security projects has flowed to southeastern Kentucky, that those who are there have taken to calling it `Silicon Holler' with the institute and the university consortium at the heart of it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would submit that handling this funding in any other way than through earmarks might put a damper on what appears to be a spoil system where certain powerful Members are able to shower their districts with taxpayer dollars. If we had regular order and a regular authorization-appropriation oversight process, we wouldn't be earmarking funds like this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would inquire also as to what, if any, oversight the Appropriations Committee has undertaken to ensure that the $60 million that has already been given to the institute was worthwhile and why an additional $11 million is warranted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would submit also that, when taxpayers send their dollars to Washington, they expect more than an earmarking system that is absent real oversight and that seems to just give the keys to the Treasury to a few powerful appropriators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will soon be circulating a letter to Speaker Pelosi and to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey, asking them to ensure that if we don't have regular order and if we don't go through the appropriations process that we not air-drop earmarks into an omnibus bill when this body has not had a chance to even see them, let alone to adequately vet them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to do better with the taxpayers' money. We should be better stewards. We have a time-honored process in this body of authorization, appropriation and oversight  that we have been ignoring for years, and the taxpayers are the worse for it. We cannot continue to do that. This institution is a better body than that, and we ought to give more respect to it.</paragraph>
