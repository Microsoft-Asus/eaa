    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="30">H.R. 30</bill>, as introduced by our colleague, Mr. Darrell Issa from California, amends the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to participate in the Eastern Municipal Water District Recycled Water System Pressurization and Expansion Project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will provide limited financial assistance to the district for the expansion of the Eastern Municipal Water District pressure zone system, a critical part of their water recycling system. The legislation will help the district maintain a stable, secure water supply to strengthen the community's ability to attract business, sustain its economy, protect its environment, and deal with the community's needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Mr. Issa for his hard work on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="30">H.R. 30</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="30">H.R. 30</bill> recognizes the need to capture and treat waste runoff to meet growing water supply needs in arid Southern California. The water recycling project envisioned in this legislation will help drought-proof the region and reduce its dependence on imported water from the Colorado River.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend our colleague from California (Mr. Issa) for his continued leadership and attention on developing new water supplies. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill is not new. In fact, this is the second go-around for it, but that doesn't make it any easier. This bill, like many in the last Congress, died in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's going to be different this time thanks to Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Young. They considered this, reviewed to see if there were any significant changes, and quickly reported it out of committee. I want to thank them for working on a bipartisan basis to do that early on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is important to the people of Southern California. As the gentlelady, who will speak, hopefully, next, will tell you, California has water. Unfortunately, we don't capture enough, and it isn't where we need it and when we need it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="30">H.R. 30</bill> is designed to bring some of that availability by significantly increasing our use of recycled water, both helping maintain the aquifer and providing safe, clean water for a multitude of uses for the people of Southern California. I urge the support of this bill, and I will not mention the other body again, except to say that I am looking forward to this early passage turning into an early signature by the President.</paragraph>
