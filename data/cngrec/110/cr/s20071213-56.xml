  <narrative>The legislative clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>A bill (<bill type="s" number="2484">S. 2484</bill>) to rename the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development as the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.</narrative>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="NAME CHANGE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am hopeful we will approve tonight a bill I have authored with Senators Mikulski, Enzi and Harkin, The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Development Act. This act will change the name of the National Institute of Child Health and Development to the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill honors a truly great American who has played a unique role in advancing children's health, and particularly in shaping how we treat individuals with intellectual disabilities. Few Americans have ever played such a profound role as Ms. Shriver has played in her life and it is entirely fitting that we rename NICHD on her behalf.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="NAME CHANGE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank Mr. Hatch for introducing this legislation, which I have joined as an original cosponsor. Ms. Shriver's contribution stands alone, both in terms of what she has done in terms of individuals with intellectual disabilities and their meaningful contribution in society as well as in advancing basic research at the National Institutes of Health. The National Institute of Child Health and Development was launched in the beginning of the Kennedy Administration  and Ms. Shriver and her husband Sargent advocated for the institute when many knowledgeable scientists were willing to write off these individuals and advocated that the money spent at the NICHD would be better spent studying adult diseases. Ms. Shriver advocated for this research and I think it is fair to say without her advocacy the Institute would not be what it is today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="NAME CHANGE">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues for their support of this legislation. I also thank Senators Mikulski and Harkin, who were other original cosponsors of this legislation. I will speak at a later time on the extraordinary difference that my sister, Eunice, has made in the lives of millions of Americans, but for now, I wish to comment on an aspect of the legislation before us. As we enact this legislation, I did want to make clear, that it is my understanding that nothing in  this bill changes any authorities that we provided NIH and its director in the NIH Reform Act that we passed last Congress. Specifically, this does not change any of the authorities of the Scientific Management Review Board or any other provisions provided in section 401 of that act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is that the intent and understanding of my colleagues as well?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="NAME CHANGE">
    <paragraph>Yes, this legislation is only meant to change the name of the single institute within NIH and to have no other effect on the NIH or its organization.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="NAME CHANGE">
    <paragraph>I agree. We do not intend this to change or signal any other change at NIH.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in support of the legislation before us, <bill type="s" number="2484">S. 2484</bill>. This bill renames the National Institute of Child Health and Development at the NIH as the "Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Development".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This renaming bill was added during the HELP Committee markup to <bill type="s" number="1011">S. 1011</bill>, given that <bill type="s" number="1011">S. 1011</bill> renamed two other Institutes at the National Institutes of Health. Senator Hatch, Senator Mikulski, and I sponsored this amendment, and it was unanimously accepted by the HELP Committee. Then, <bill type="s" number="1011">S. 1011</bill> was unanimously voted out of Committee. We would like to have moved the entire bill, but unfortunately, we are not able to do that today due to some objections. Therefore, we are trying  to get done what we can get done at the end of this session and simply moving the amendment that does not raise concerns with other members of this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand that it is unusual to rename an institute at NIH after an individual, but this is an unusual case. Ms. Shriver has long been associated with the National Institute of Child Health and Development, NICHD, and was an early champion of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NICHD was established in the 1960s by President Kennedy when he ushered in a "New Frontier" focusing on science and its potential for improving everyone's life. During the 1960s, we also learned of the biological causes of intellectual disabilities. At the same time, Ms. Shriver was an advocate for people with intellectual disabilities. With the help of her husband, Sargent, Ms. Shriver took on the challenge of improving the lives of people with intellectual disabilities and pursued that goal  as a senior adviser to the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suspect other Members will note her work with the Special Olympics. That is only a small portion of what she has done for individuals with intellectual disabilities. At the time of NICHD's creation, many leaders in the scientific community felt that money spent to research topics related to human development and intellectual disability would be better spent elsewhere. Ms. Shriver played a seminal role helping the scientific community, policymakers, and the general public recognize the importance  of such research. She recognized that it was not just important for those with intellectual disabilities, but the research was a bridge to understanding broader, more general aspects of human development. Therefore, it would not be an overstatement to say that, without Ms. Shriver's contribution, this institute would not exist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, Mr. President, I rise today and ask for the support of my colleagues in recognizing the contributions of Ms. Shriver through quick enactment of this legislation, <bill type="s" number="2484">S. 2484</bill>.</paragraph>

  <chair> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Since it was established by Congress in 1962 at the request of President John F. Kennedy, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has achieved an outstanding record of achievement in catalyzing a concentrated attack on the unsolved health problems of children and of mother-infant relationships by fulfilling its mission to--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) ensure that every individual is born healthy and wanted, that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives, free from disease or disability; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) ensure the health, productivity, independence, and well-being of all individuals through optimal rehabilitation.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has made unparalleled contributions to the advancement of child health and human development, including significant efforts to--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) reduce dramatically the rates of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, infant mortality, and maternal HIV transmission;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) develop the Haemophilus Influenza B (Hib) vaccine, credited with nearly eliminating the incidence of mental retardation; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) conduct intramural research, support extramural research, and train thousands of child health and human development researchers who have contributed greatly to dramatic gains in child health throughout the world.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) The vision, drive, and tenacity of one woman, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, was instrumental in proposing, passing, and enacting legislation to establish the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (Public Law 87-838) on October 17, 1962.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) It is befitting and appropriate to recognize the substantial achievements of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, a tireless advocate for children with special needs, whose foresight in creating the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development gave life to the words of President Kennedy, who wished to "encourage imaginative research into the complex processes of human development from conception to old age.".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
