    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to salute my dear friend Rebecca "Becky" Wood Watkin as she celebrates her 95th birthday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born on April 4, 1913, in Portland, OR, Becky graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1933 and went on to the University of Pennsylvania to study architecture. Undeterred by the fact that the Architecture Department did not accept female students at that time, Becky completed all required courses and became the first woman graduate in architecture from the University of Pennsylvania in 1937. That same year, Becky relocated to San Francisco and applied at a variety of architectural firms, none of  which wanted a woman in the drafting room. Despite her difficulties with finding employment in the male-dominated workforce, Becky persevered, earning her California architectural license in 1944.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A vanguard for aspiring women professionals everywhere, Becky opened her own architectural practice in Marin County in 1951. In the midst of these professional milestones, Becky also gave birth to three wonderful children. As a working mother, Becky looked for ways to use her personal and professional talents to help those in need, becoming a tremendous source of support and energy to causes that she believed helped the community, including the Ecumenical Housing Association and Planned Parenthood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, 1948 saw Becky enter the political realm for the first time, by fundraising for Roger Kent, a local Democratic candidate for Congress. This initial political activity 60 years ago spearheaded a lifelong involvement with Democratic politics, a passion of Becky's that allowed her to work on the presidential campaigns for Adlai Stevenson, John Kennedy, Eugene McCarthy, George McGovern, and Jimmy Carter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Inspired by Becky's trailblazing story and her fervent belief in good government, I first met Becky in the late 1970s when she helped me get reelected to the Marin County Board of Supervisors in 1980. As a young working mother myself, Becky quickly became a deeply admired mentor. As the years passed and our friendship grew, she was instrumental in helping me move up the political ladder to the House of Representatives and then to the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we celebrate the 95th year of her remarkably courageous and passionate life, I remain in admiration of Becky's strong sense of civic duty, honesty, integrity, and perseverance. Along with hundreds of her family, friends, and admirers, I wish her many more years of continued happiness.</paragraph>
