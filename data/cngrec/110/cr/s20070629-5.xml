    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. There will be no votes today. The next votes are expected to occur Monday, around 5:30; that is July 9.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said yesterday, the Senate will vote on the remaining four judicial nominations that are on the Executive Calendar. Also, on Monday, July 9, the Senate will begin consideration of the Defense Department authorization bill, an extremely important bill for all of our military servicemembers in Iraq, Afghanistan, North Korea, and all over the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when the Senate leaves today for the Fourth of July recess and returns on July 9, Members should expect a very busy legislative work period during the month of July.</paragraph>
