    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of every working woman who faces pay discrimination in the workforce and call on the House to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. Last week, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 to limit the ability of women and other employees to sue their employers for pay discrimination under title VII. The court decided that a victim of pay disparity should be able to document a discriminatory difference in pay within a mere 6 months, despite the typical office  secrecy over income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Supreme Court is essentially rolling back efforts to ensure equal pay. When women still earn only 77 percent of what men earn, this ruling leaves these individuals with no recourse or remedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Paycheck Fairness Act will help women confront discrimination in the workplace and give teeth to the Equal Pay Act by prohibiting employers from retaliating against employees who share salary information with their co-workers; allowing women to sue for punitive damages and recovery of back pay; and create a new program to help strengthen the negotiation skills of girls and women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, next Sunday, we commemorate 44 years since John F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act and still equal pay is not a fact of life for American women. It is time to value the work that women do in our society. Let's pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.</paragraph>
