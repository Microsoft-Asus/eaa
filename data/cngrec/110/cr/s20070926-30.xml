  <narrative>COMMISSION ON WARTIME CONTRACTING -- (Senate - September 26, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12135">S12135</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to deliver tonight some brief remarks about a matter that a group of freshmen Democrats in this body have worked on together, and that is a bipartisan commission on wartime contracting and to expand the authority of the existing oversight mechanisms to help make sure our taxpayer dollars are spent properly and wisely in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, like the Presiding Officer from the State of Ohio, joined Senators WEBB and MCCASKILL and 23 other Members in cosponsoring this amendment and encourage the full Senate to approve it when it comes to a vote tomorrow. As a former auditor general in Pennsylvania, I know firsthand the need to aggressively root out waste in government. But it is especially egregious to discover waste and abuse and the loss of taxpayer dollars when our troops are in harm's way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also know that the oversight required to monitor potential abuse is a full-time job. That is why this amendment takes the extraordinary step of creating a new commission, evenly divided between the political parties, to investigate contractor abuses in a thorough manner. Some have argued we should leave this task to our existing committees in the Senate. I and my cosponsors, respectfully disagree with that assessment. As the distinguished Senator from Michigan said earlier today on the floor,  our existing committees in the Senate, if they have this responsibility, would grind to a halt if any of those committees had to undertake a full investigation of contractor abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan. The commission we propose is deliberately patterned after the Truman Commission--named, of course, after a former President, but at the time the Truman Commission was named for his work in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Truman Commission consisted of a group of patriotic Americans that was charged with the mission of studying all financial and military transactions related to the execution of our war effort during World War II. This Commission recognized that it was not only American military might that would win the war in the struggle against the axis powers, but that every dollar saved, every dollar and every resource rescued would materially contribute to the war effort and enable the American Nation  to focus its power and its energy on our common enemy at that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are very different from World War II, we know that, but the same principles apply when it comes to rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse. Every day we read the horror stories about the lack of body armor for our troops. We see that the military has failed to order enough mine resistant ambush protective--so-called MRAP--vehicles to secure all of our troops. We hear our military stock is in need of urgent replenishment. The United States is a wealthy nation, we know  that, but we are not a nation of infinite riches and resources. We have to prioritize our spending and make hard choices. That is why it is so important to crack down on contractor abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan. We cannot afford to let companies doing business there profit--profit--from fraud and abuse at the same time we need those very dollars for real priorities--our men and women in uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction reported that $9 billion spent on Iraq's reconstruction was missing--unaccounted for--due to inefficiencies and bad management. When I say missing, I literally mean the special inspector general's office was unable to find out what happened to this money. Only last week, the Pentagon disclosed that it is auditing $88 billion in contracts and programs for financial irregularities. Let me repeat that number--$88 billion. This is not  a case of a few inappropriate cost overruns in contracts or sloppy bookkeeping in other contracts. Here we know that 40 individuals--40 individuals--and private companies have already been suspended, debarred, or are proposed for debarment. Another 30 investigations await prosecution at the Department of Justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Contractor abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan is a national scandal. It is an embarrassment. I think it also represents a taking. Every dollar wasted there is a dollar taken away from our troops and our ability to fight the enemy. Most of us supporting this amendment today were elected last year on the promise to change the culture in Washington and to no longer take for granted this type of crass corruption. We shouldn't accept it. We should root it out and do everything possible to make it almost  impossible to commit this kind of crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation establishes an independent commission to comprehensively vet Federal agency contracting for reconstruction, logistical support of coalition forces, and security and intelligence functions in Iraq and Afghanistan. What we are talking about is an independent and bipartisan commission to provide real credibility and real authority in cracking down on waste, fraud, and abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment also provides significant new powers to the already existing Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction to expand his important work and coordinate with this  new commission. I had the chance earlier this month to meet with Stuart Bowen, who is that inspector general and in that position. We discussed this amendment, and he agreed it was a good proposal, one that deserved to be implemented to enhance the ability to uncover and prosecute  gross abuses of the public trust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No matter where one stands on the war in Iraq, I would hope we could agree on the need to eliminate all waste and fraud and prosecute those who facilitate such fraud and such waste. These actions bring dishonor to our Nation and, in a word, are unpatriotic. We should do everything we can to root out such abuses, and this amendment is an important first step to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
