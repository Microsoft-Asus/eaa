  <speaking speaker="400633" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to pay tribute to Sergeant Nicholas Carnes, a citizen soldier who believed in our Nation and acted on that belief to answer the Nation's call to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nick Carnes was from Dayton, Kentucky. He lost his life on August 26, 2007, in Orgun-e, Afghanistan. Sergeant Carnes served with Alpha Battery, 2nd Battalion, 138th Field Artillery Regiment in the Army National Guard in Carrollton, Kentucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nick Carnes was a lifelong Kentuckian who grew up in Dayton and graduated from Dayton High School in 2000. Nick joined the Army National Guard at 17 and began working at BB Riverboats. Shortly before his deployment in October 2006, he became a riverboat captain and married his sweetheart, Terri Bernstein Carnes. Sergeant Carnes was due back in Kentucky this month to celebrate his first anniversary with his wife.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was at the sendoff for Alpha Battery in October of 2006. We saw the families. We saw the motivated soldiers who were ready to go and answer the call of service. I had the great honor and privilege to see Nick, to meet him and talk with him while I was there. And I was impressed with him. The one thing that this old soldier can say is I know a good noncommissioned officer, the backbone of our military, representing the character of our Nation, when I see one, and he clearly showed me that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A man or a woman is the product of many things. First, Nick's mom, Wray Jean, and dad, Gove, you gave the Nation a great young man. You gave our community a great young man. And that was reflected in a letter that he sent to Terri on November 11, 2006, a few weeks after the unit had activated. He wrote this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Dear Terri:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Hello, beautiful. I hope this letter finds you in good spirits. Also, I hope you are coping well with my absence. You mean the world to me, my beautiful wife. I am so sorry that my decisions in life have forced me to be away from you. Unfortunately, I can't change those decisions. Even if I could, I believe that I would sacrifice time with you to be part of helping another country and defending our own. If the other soldiers who came before me did not stand up for freedom, then we would not  have freedom. So I feel that I am obligated to stand up for freedom to ensure that everyone else after me has the same freedoms we do today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I am not going to Afghanistan to kill Afghans. I am going there to help them stand up to the Taliban and regain control of their country. As people, sometimes we need help. Afghans happen to need help. Yes, helping the Afghans may put me in harm's way, but I have been well trained and will continue to receive training for the rest my military career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Everything will be fine. I feel confident and will do everything within my power to bring myself home safely. You need not worry, baby doll. I will go and do the job that is asked of me and return myself to your arms. I love you. Nick."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The greatest value of our citizens serving is not simply their military proficiency, but the amazing character of a free people, embodied in the life of a young man like Nick Carnes, who understood the call that he was accepting and saw the higher good and the greater purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tonight, Mr. Speaker, I ask that we honor Sergeant Carnes and his service to our great Nation. Sergeant Carnes was a brave soldier, dedicated husband, loving son, who was taken from us all too quickly fighting for a cause that he truly believed in. I honor his bravery. I honor his legacy. My thoughts and prayers are with his friends and family during this solemn time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is fitting to rise and honor this young man who laid down his life for the defense of our Nation on Constitution Day. As I stand here tonight, we talk about the Constitution as one of the great cornerstones of the form of government that we have as a free people. Yet, its preservation will not occur unless there are young men and women like Nick Carnes to come forward in every generation to answer that call, to be willing, as he said, to place himself in harm's way to preserve  the ideals that he believed in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we look tonight, I am reminded of the words of Jesus in John 15:13, who  declared, "No one has greater love than this, that he lay down his life for his friends."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To you, Nick, I say thank you. Thank you for the example of your life. To his comrades in Alpha Battery who are here in this country now and also back in the theater, I say thank you for carrying on the mission. Thank you for honoring the flag, the highest ideals of service and what we represent as Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four special people in his life also need to be thanked, because as much of our country does not know, serving in the military is a family business that only 1 percent of our population responds to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Terri, I bear condolences for you, as I shared with you at the funeral home on behalf of a grateful Nation. Despite political differences that fly in the air, the backbone of our freedom is founded in sacrifices like your family has made, and I thank you for lending us Nick for a time. To Wray Jean and Gove, Nick's mom and dad, I say thank you for your son's service and for the example of his character. To his father-in-law Alan, thank you for your example and work. Raising a young leader  who impacted our community, his duty and honor to country represent the best and greatest aspects of our national character. His sacrifice is not in vain</paragraph>
