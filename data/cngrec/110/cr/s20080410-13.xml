    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the recent acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase and the events that caused the downfall of one of our largest investment banks and its eventual merger with JPMorgan Chase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I first learned of the merger, I urged Chairman DODD to hold a hearing. Last week, the Banking Committee began to exercise its much-needed oversight role on this deal. The hearing served to shine a spotlight on the actions of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past 2 weeks, we have learned much about the events that led up to Bear Stearns demise and how the government interceded to save it. Unfortunately, some of the accounts have raised more questions than answers. Congress must continue to look into this deal and possible illegal behavior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am calling on the proper law enforcement authorities to investigate whether illegal insider trading may have fueled Bear Stearns' downfall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the days, hours and, ultimately, minutes before news of Bear Stearns became public, it appears trading in Bear Stearns' stock jumped substantially.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Volume trading in shares of Bear Stearns jumped from just over 5 million shares on the first day of trading in March to an astronomical 186,986,900 shares on March 14--2 days before the Fed authorized the $29 billion bailout. Let me say that one more time. Volume trading in shares of Bear Stearns jumped from just over 5 million shares on the first day of trading in March to an astronomical 186,986,900 shares on Friday, March 14. In fact, the previous high in volume over the last year was just  over 28 million shares. Yet on March 14, shares of Bear Stearns were traded nearly 187 million times. They were traded at nearly 187 million times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is uncertain whether or not rampant fears of the company's demise led to that spike or whether those looking to make a buck engaged in illegal market manipulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the hearing last Thursday, I asked SEC Chairman Cox if he was aware of any evidence suggesting that speculators had bet heavily that Bear Stearns' share price would fall, known on Wall Street as "short selling."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Cox responded: "I'm a little bit constrained because the SEC is in the law enforcement business." He stated that SEC pursues insider trading aggressively and said his agency was mulling "several law enforcement matters" that had not been filed in any U.S. court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I will be sending this letter to Chairman Cox, as well as Attorney General Mukasey, calling on them to immediately and thoroughly investigate the role that short-selling played in the events surrounding Bear Stearns' collapse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Market manipulation is illegal and must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I am asking that Chairman Cox and Attorney General Mukasey to respond to me and the Senate Banking Committee with a report as early as possible about this investigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American taxpayers have been asked to carry the burden of a $29 billion loan that is linked to possibly risky mortgage backed securities. In fact, JPMorgan Chase would not have agreed to acquire Bear Stearns had the government not shared the risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to repeat that one more time--one of the world's largest and most respected investment banks would not carry the full risk without government aid. And we are supposed to believe on blind faith that the investment is safe and will be repaid in full?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Knowing the consequences and the burden is being carried not only by shareholders, but by average taxpayers who live paycheck-to-paycheck, we must learn if the Federal Reserve acted properly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must be certain that investors did not violate laws barring speculators from engaging in market manipulation or insider trading. We must be certain that the taxpayers did not post a preemptive bailout to cover massive short selling for those to make money in the markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rose on the floor last week to raise my concern for the families in Montana and the rest of the country who work hard and play by the rules; yet, can't find a decent place to live that they can afford. And for communities throughout rural America where opportunity is slipping away because of the failure of the national leadership to invest in basic infrastructure that connects us to one another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These families cannot be asked to cover what some are calling a Government bailout when they are having hard time filling their truck with diesel and to save for their kid's college fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to hearing back from the SEC and Department of Justice. I hope they tell me that it was fear and nothing but market dynamics and not illegal trading. I hope they will tell me that the $29 billion loan was justified and was a one-time act to prevent an economic meltdown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if there was insider trading and market manipulation, the proper law enforcement authorities of the U.S. government must respond with appropriate action and prosecute any wrong-doing to the fullest extent of the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.</paragraph>
