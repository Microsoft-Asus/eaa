  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HARE" of="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, yesterday, this House took a critical step in changing the way business is done in Washington. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 provides the most sweeping lobby reform in a generation, finally bringing unprecedented transparency to lobbyist activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During last year's election, the American people unequivocally called for a change in the way business is done in Washington. This bill, along with the ethics reform our Democratic majority enacted in the first 100 hours of the 110th Congress, are significant steps forward in cleaning up the culture of corruption that has plagued Washington for far too long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As soon as Democrats took control of this Congress, we began a new era of honest and open government, finally returning this House to the American people and making sure that the work we do here is something that we can be proud of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, by passing the comprehensive lobbying reform yesterday, we are keeping our promise to the American people to make this Congress the most honest and open in history.</paragraph>
