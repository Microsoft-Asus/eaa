  <narrative>RECOGNIZING THE SAFE COALITION -- (Senate - January 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="85">S85</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, early in 2007 I met with a distinguished group of American business leaders and retired military officers who had formed an organization called Securing America's Future Energy, SAFE, Coalition for the purpose of improving our country's energy security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This organization was comprised of a high level group of business and retired military leaders led by Federal Express CEO Fred Smith, and retired Marine GEN P.X. Kelley. They understood that our country's continued dependence on foreign oil coming from troubled parts of the world holds our entire economy hostage to events that are outside of our control. They knew that our energy security relates to both economic security and our national security and they wanted to do something about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their organization worked to develop a specific, aggressive plan that would reduce our dependence on foreign oil and reduce the intensity of oil use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the plan called for an increase in vehicle efficiency through more aggressive CAFE standards. It also called for additional energy production here at home, both renewable and fossil energy, a much greater emphasis on conservation, and new and innovative ways to make more efficient use of our energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following our meeting I decided to take the lead in sponsoring legislation to implement the bulk of the SAFE Coalition's plan because I believed it was the best combination of approaches to begin solving our problem of excessive dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the end of 2007 I am pleased to say that a substantial portion of that legislation which was recommended by the SAFE Coalition is now law. For the first time in over 34 years, Congress finally increased CAFE standards that require a 10-mile-per-gallon increase over 10 years. It applies to both automobiles and trucks and does it in a way that does not penalize large vehicles. But it requires all vehicles to meet greater efficiency standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congress also included major new goals with respect to a robust renewable fuel standard of 36 billion gallons a year. All of those provisions were recommendations of the SAFE Coalition and recommendations in the legislation that I introduced in the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The recommendations on additional production of energy was advanced with the recent passage legislation to open a portion of the Gulf of Mexico, known as Lease 181, to additional production of oil and natural gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is still more to be done to reduce our oil intensity and to allow us to become less dependent on foreign sources of oil. But I was proud to have been a member of the Energy Committee in the Senate that has advanced an energy bill with real and constructive solutions that will improve America's energy future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I was also pleased to work with Fred Smith, P.X. Kelley, and many other American leaders who wanted to do the right thing for this country and whose efforts as a part of the SAFE Coalition, I believe, had measurable and substantial impact on the progress that we made this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a climate of so much partisanship, and at a time when it is so difficult to get things done, I am proud that all of us, working together, did something that represents a real investment in America's future.</paragraph>
