  <narrative>REPUBLICANS CLAIM THEY WANT ALL OF THE ABOVE BUT HAVE DONE NOTHING TO LOWER GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8281]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. SIRES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412186" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, both Democrats and Republicans have been talking about high gas prices for months. At first, Republicans said we just needed to drill, drill, drill, but then they joined us in saying that a more comprehensive, all-of-the-above proposal was in order. It turns out it was just all talk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats have been trying to reverse the failed Bush policies of the past, but Republicans keep saying no. We proposed legislation to crack down on price gouging and to curb excess speculation. Republicans said no. We proposed lowering gas prices immediately by tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Republicans said no. We proposed legislation that would force Big Oil to drill on 68 million acres of land to increase oil production here at home. Republicans again said no.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, we passed an all-of-the-above energy package to bring down prices and to invest in America's energy future, but again, Republicans voted no.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it seems like Republicans don't actually want to resolve the crisis. They just want to talk about the crisis.</paragraph>
