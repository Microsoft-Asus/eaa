    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, to govern is to choose. For the past 6 years, the choices made by the Republican leadership in this Congress have been wrong for America: tax cuts for the very wealthy, budget cuts for everyone else in health care, in education and the environment. It has led to the largest deficit in the history of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new Congress is making a different choice, promising to invest in America's priorities, first by bringing back fiscal responsibility and then making government work for average working families. Last week this House passed a Homeland Security bill. It improves aviation and port security, restores cuts to first responders across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week we passed an Energy and Water appropriations bill that finally provides a significant investment in studying the effects of global warming, something that's been ignored for far too long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new Congress is moving this country in a new direction and has made a new choice.</paragraph>
