  <narrative>CONSUMER-FIRST ENERGY ACT OF 2008--MOTION TO PROCEED -- (Senate - June 06, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5375">S5375</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the price of oil is $132 a barrel. I do not know how the stock market is going to wind up, but with the slap in the face the economy got today with the unemployment rate skyrocketing and the price of oil $132 a barrel, the stock market is down about 300 points. How it is going to wind up today, I do not know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on the global warming bill we just completed--and I say "completed"--we were unable to offer amendments, we were unable to legislate on this most important piece of legislation. The Republicans said what they wanted to do is anytime we mention "global warming," they would mention "gas prices."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, today, we do not have to guess what we are going to do next because I am going to file cloture on the most important piece of legislation dealing with gas prices we have done in some time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. President, we, as I have indicated, heard the Republicans speak at length about the problem of high gas prices. In doing so, they follow the lead of the majority who have been not just speaking about high gas prices for months but now working to find some solutions. We introduced something called the Consumer-First Energy Act. It was blocked by the Republicans. But now maybe, with gas prices even higher than they were a month ago, our Republican friends are finally ready to join our pursuit  of solutions. Perhaps now, after taking their gas prices on the floor of the Senate for a week and talking about it and talking about it, they are ready to back their words with action. So next week they will have a chance--it will be Tuesday morning--to vote on gas prices. We are going to return to that legislation that will relieve the burden of record gas prices for American consumers, both in the long term and the short term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is in this bill? The President will remember, one of the things in the bill previously--we had five sections of the bill--one of them said: Mr. President, with the gas prices as high as they are, why do you continue to take this oil, the best oil there is--the sweet crude--and pump it into the Petroleum Reserve when it is almost filled anyway?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we did that, and that now is not happening anymore. He is not pumping that because we peeled part of that off and passed it individually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what is left in our legislation? First, it ends in billions of dollars in tax breaks for oil companies--oil companies whose executives have been hauling in record profits while we pay record prices for gasoline. I don't know what it is in Virginia, but in Nevada the price of gas is now more than $4 a gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I sat on the floor of the Senate earlier this week, a friend of mine whom I went to high school with--his name is Ted Sandival and I have done legal work for him over the years when I practiced law and we have maintained a relationship--called me. I was wondering what was wrong. In the whole conversation, the only thing he expressed to me that he was concerned about was that he always wanted to buy a diesel vehicle because they last so much longer. So he bought a diesel vehicle and he said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the oil companies are making record profits. The oil executives are making record salaries and bonuses and are getting record amounts of compensation, and we don't think it is appropriate at this time for the American taxpayers to continue paying billions of dollars in tax breaks to the oil companies. We are going to vote on this Tuesday morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other section of our bill forces oil companies to do their part by investing part of their profits in clean and affordable alternative energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third: We protect the American people from price gougers and greedy oil traders who manipulate the market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, a bipartisan section of this bill. Senators SPECTER and KOHL came to see me yesterday, both longtime members of the Judiciary Committee who believe that OPEC and others who are colluding to keep oil prices high should be subject to this Sherman Antitrust Act. Senator Specter went through all the legal reasons, and as we all know, he is a real legal scholar. So I am convinced he is right and we should do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Consumer First Energy Act does exactly what it promises: It ends more than 7 years of the Cheney energy policy that has lined the pockets of modern-day oil barons and left the American people to pay the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, it puts consumers first. Is this a silver bullet ending all the problems? Of course not. But it is a bill that will solve some of the energy problems we have in our country today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is an important step that will make a difference, as I have said, in the long and the short run. So I hope the minority will put their votes where their mouths have been all week. Passing this smart, responsible bill will help put American families first and help take another step on the road to a renewable revolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, normally what we do is ask unanimous consent to move forward on this legislation. We know the minority, if they were here, would object. They are not here, so rather than embarrass anyone, I will now move to proceed to Calendar No. 743, <bill type="s" number="3044">S. 3044</bill>, and send a cloture motion to the desk.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The cloture motion having been presented under rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.</chair>
  <narrative>The legislative clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Cloture Motion</narrative>
  <narrative>We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to proceed to <bill type="s" number="3044">S. 3044</bill>, the Consumer-First Energy Act of 2008.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum be waived.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>I now withdraw the motion.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The motion is withdrawn.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I filed cloture on the motion to proceed to the legislation that I outlined, <bill type="s" number="3044">S. 3044</bill>, which is the Consumer First Energy Act. I am going to shortly move to proceed to <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill>, the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008. However, prior to doing that, I was going to ask unanimous consent that if cloture were invoked on the motion to proceed to <bill type="s" number="3044">S. 3044</bill>, that then the cloture motion on <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill> would be withdrawn. Since there is no one from the Republican side here  to launch an objection, which I am told they would do, I am not going to ask for unanimous consent today but will do so on Monday when a Republican is here in the Senate.</paragraph>
