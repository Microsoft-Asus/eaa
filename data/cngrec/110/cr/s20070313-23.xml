    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of the late Ernest Gallo, a true American success story who came from a humble beginning to head the world's largest winemaking company. Mr. Gallo passed away in the peaceful company of his family and loved ones at his home in Modesto, California on March 6, 2007. He was 97 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first son of Joseph and Susie Gallo, immigrants who hailed from Italy's renowned winemaking region of Piedmont, Ernest Gallo was born in Jackson, in the Sierra Nevada foothills region of California. Ernest and his younger brothers, Julio and Joe, gained important insight into the winemaking business by working alongside their father in the family vineyard. As a precocious and driven 17-year-old boy, Ernest sold a railcar full of family grapes during a trip to Chicago for $17,000, a considerable  sum of money during those days. From that point forward, it was apparent that Ernest was a gifted and determined entrepreneur who was destined for great success in the winemaking business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After his parents unexpectedly passed away, Ernest accepted the mantle of the head of the business and the family at the age of 24 and founded E. and J. Gallo Winery in 1933 using a $5,000 loan from Ernest's mother-in-law and his brother Julio's entire savings of less than $1,000. Throughout his stewardship of the winery that would become one of the world's most prolific and recognized winemaking companies, Ernest consistently demonstrated an unparalleled ability to produce affordable, popular,  and high quality products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A wine connoisseur in the truest sense of the word, Ernest was a perfectionist who left his imprint on nearly every aspect of the winemaking process; from overseeing production, to devising brilliant marketing plans, to regularly traveling across the country to make sure that wine displays were properly presented in markets. Simply put, Ernest was a consummate winemaker who was absolutely dedicated to honing and perfecting his craft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ernest Gallo has left behind a legacy of success and the well-deserved recognition as one of the leading figures of American winemaking. This son of California's Central Valley will be greatly missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ernest Gallo was preceded in death by his beloved wife of 62 years, Amelia, and son, David. He is survived by his son, Joseph, and four grandchildren.</paragraph>
