    <paragraph>Mr. President, despite the fact that we are fast approaching the 6-year anniversary since the terrorist attacks of September 11, it is painfully clear that we have a lot of work to do to protect this Nation from further terrorist attacks. The threats are real, they are growing, and when Democrats took control of the Congress at the start of this year, we said we would implement the unanimous recommendation of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. That matter passed this body by a big vote.  That is where we said we should implement into law the 9/11 Commission recommendations. Democrats voted for that, and Republicans voted for it. It was one of the first bills we passed at the start of this session of Congress. The House passed its version of the bill on January 9. The Senate passed our bill on March 13. The House bill was 299 to 128; ours was 60 to 38.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues know, Democrats and Republicans who serve on the House and Senate committees with jurisdiction over this bill have worked tirelessly to resolve the differences on these two bills. I myself have spoken to Chairman Lieberman, I don't think it is an exaggeration to say a dozen times. The American people expect us to finish this work quickly, and that is why we believe we need to take the next procedural step as part of our regular order, which is to appoint conferees to  finish these negotiations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When this bill is signed into law, it will make America more secure. It will improve the screening of maritime cargo so that Americans can be assured we are doing all we can to prevent the smuggling of weapons into this country, including nuclear weapons. It will improve the congressional oversight of intelligence to ensure we are building the best capabilities possible to stop terrorist attacks. It will improve information sharing and communications interoperability among first responders so  that they can work swiftly to prevent terrorist attacks. It will ensure that transportation and mass-transit structures are hardened against terrorist attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation wasn't something a couple of Senators dreamed up. It was the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission, chaired by Governor Kean and cochaired by Congressman Hamilton, a Republican and a Democrat. This is what we are doing. We are long past when we should have done this. We need to do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I make the following request, Mr. President: I ask unanimous consent  that the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee be discharged from further consideration of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> and that the Senate then proceed to its consideration; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of <bill type="s" number="4">S.4</bill>, as passed by the Senate on March 13, 2007, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill be read a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid  upon the table; that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, with the above occurring with no intervening action or debate.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the leadership has been continuing to consult with our colleagues who are working on this legislation, and I have the impression, from talking to Members who are involved, that they have done a lot of good work and perhaps have made some progress that will lead to being able to get a conference and act on it. They have been discussing some very significant issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the problems that I recall is that this legislation went well beyond what was just in the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and that is a major part of the problem. There was some other language that was of great concern and could lead this bill to be vetoed by the President, but he does not want to veto it, and we want to get a bill that we can agree on that can become law. We all want to strengthen our homeland security, but, as quite often is the case in the Congress--the House or the  Senate or the both of us--we put language in these bills that is problematic and, in my opinion and others, counterproductive. So we don't want to get to a point where we can't get an agreement or get a bill signed into law and have to start back at square one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to emphasize that the impression of the leadership--and that is whom I am speaking for here--is that they are working and making progress, and we hope they will continue to do that and get a good, productive, and bipartisan agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this point, I must object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I, of course, am very disappointed my Republican colleague has chosen to object to this request on moving forward on the 9/11 Commission recommendations bill. The minority stated yesterday that they had a problem with the bill. We agreed to take that out of the bill. I don't know how much more we can do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It appears to me there are forces within the Republican Senate that simply don't want this bill enacted. This is really too bad. As my friend--and we have worked together on this Senate floor, my friend, the junior Senator from Mississippi, we have worked on this floor together for many years. When he was the majority leader, we worked together in detail on so many different issues, so this is not directed toward him. But I do say that there have been procedural roadblocks thrown up in front  of virtually everything we have tried to do in the Senate this year. I was hoping we could reconsider this obstructionism when it comes to moving legislation that would make America more secure. Every day we wait on this is another day for the terrorists. For example, I talked about cargo screening. Other countries do it, but we don't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These phantom issues which are blocking this bill do not exist. This is a bill which the managers, Senator Lieberman and others, have worked out. We could go to conference and do this bill in one-half hour, an hour. And this is a real conference where conferees would sit down, there would be open debate, public debate, there is nothing to jam this through. This is the way we should do things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 victims' families have organizations, and these family representatives are calling for all parties to move this forward, and we are listening to them. This bill needs to pass. We are willing to be flexible. We have shown that. I would hope my Republican colleagues and the  administration will demonstrate what they do not like about this bill, and what they do not like about it, tell us. This bill is important. It is important for me and my family, every Senator here and their families, everybody in this country, and every day we don't do something is a day lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can assure my Republican colleague that Senator Lieberman, our lead conferee, as well as the rest of our conferees will continue to work in a bipartisan manner, as they have to date. So I am very disappointed the Republicans are still objecting to moving the process forward on this bill. I say to my colleagues and to all Americans that I will be back on the floor again and again until our Republican friends allow us to move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do say, Mr. President, that it is a real shame we can't get this done before the Fourth of July recess. I am not exaggerating when I say this bill needs to be done. I think, without going into any confidential information, this bill should pass. We should do it as soon as we can. I urge my friend to speak to whomever needs to be spoken to on the other side to reconsider their objection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tomorrow, let us move this bill. It is Thursday. We could complete this before we go home, and it would be a day of celebration for all America that we are implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations.</paragraph>
