    <paragraph>Before closing, I offer a few comments on the TARP program. Since enactment of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act in early October, the Treasury Department has spent almost all of its initial $350 billion under TARP to recapitalize several banks and financial institutions. It has been reported that the Treasury Secretary may request the remaining $350 billion as early as this week. Under the law, the President must submit a written request that details the Treasury Secretary's  plan to use the additional funds, and Congress has 15 days to enact a disapproval resolution. However, given the track record of the Treasury's use of the initial $350 billion of TARP funds, it is difficult for many of us to feel confident that the Department</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of these issues are related to the management and oversight of the funds as reported last week by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the GAO. In its report, the GAO uncovered a number of management and oversight deficiencies that raise serious questions about the program's integrity, accountability, transparency, and effectiveness. Frankly, the GAO's findings were very troubling. The GAO pointed to the Treasury Department's inadequate staffing, failure to establish a mechanism to  track billions in taxpayer funds provided to the banks, and failure to establish a system on how it would monitor compliance with executive compensation limitations required by the legislation. In other words, it appears the Treasury is unable to tell taxpayers how their funds are being spent and whether the money is being spent in a reasonable and effective manner. I don't think that is acceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GAO also uncovered other troubling findings, such as Treasury's lack of action to address the foreclosure crisis. As we all know, the housing foreclosure crisis is at the center of the financial credit crisis. In recognition of this, the EESA included specific language for the Secretary to address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, Treasury has not taken sufficient action as communities and families across the country continue to be devastated by foreclosures. Loan modification efforts are  failing, as evidenced by the Treasury Office of Comptroller--the OCC--data released this morning. According to the OCC, about 36 percent of borrowers were more than 30 days past due on loan payments 3 months after their loan was modified and nearly 53 percent were more than 30 days late after 6 months. What is going on here?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These findings raise significant questions, if not doubts, about both private and Government loan modification efforts, including those through the Department's so-called HOPE NOW Program. As I previously warned, the administration's and Congress's push to use the Federal Housing Administration to prevent foreclosures by refinancing subprime and troubled loans may end up costing taxpayers a lot of money in the near future. Rescuing the FHA through taxpayer funds is not surprising to those who  have watched the FHA closely and know they have longstanding management and oversight  problems and lack of resources. Clearly, a more aggressive, comprehensive, and smarter</paragraph>
    <paragraph>approach to the foreclosure crisis must be taken if we are to recover from the recession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The housing crisis has now spread from subprime mortgages to prime mortgages as economic factors impact borrowers' ability to pay their mortgages. Due to expansion of the mortgage crisis, it is critical that we find measures to protect and create jobs. The importance of jobs and its impact on the housing crisis further raises the importance of devising a responsible rescue package for the auto industry since millions of jobs are at risk--over 3 million jobs in the Nation, 220,000 jobs in Missouri.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TARP has also disappointed me by the ad hoc implementation of the program. Prior to the creation of TARP, the Department seemed to be improvising on a daily basis its intervention with financial markets. One of our intents in creating TARP was to provide a structure and coherency to the Government's approach to the financial crisis. That we have not seen. Before this and the next administration submit a request for the remaining TARP funds, we expect to have answers to the questions and issues  raised by the GAO and others. The Government needs to provide more certainty on how it will address the financial and economic crisis and provide answers to taxpayers on how it has spent taxpayers funds already provided.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are very serious times. I want to see action by this Congress. I want to see us move quickly. But I also want to see action by the auto industry to advise the czar or the Secretary of Commerce, and I want to see action by the Treasury to give us a better idea of how TARP funds are being used, how they will be accounted for, how they are going to be implemented, and how they are going to be used. If they don't have an approach, I will come forward with a suggestion on how we restructure  those home loans that are in crisis.</paragraph>
