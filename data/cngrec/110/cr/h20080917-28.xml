    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I now yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I stand with my colleagues from my home State of Illinois in consideration of <bill type="h" number="6681">H.R. 6681</bill>, which renames the postal facility in New Lenox, Illinois, in honor of Jacob M. Lowell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6681">H.R. 6681</bill> enjoys the support of the entire House congressional delegation from Illinois and was introduced by Representative JERRY WELLER back on July 30, 2008. The measure was taken up by the Oversight Committee on September 10, 2008 and was passed by the panel by a voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6681">H.R. 6681</bill> calls for honoring Jacob M. Lowell's service to this country. Jacob M. Lowell of New Lenox, Illinois, was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment (Air Assault), 173rd Airborne Brigade, Camp Ederle, Italy, when he died on June 2 near Gowardesh, Afghanistan. He died of wounds suffered when his unit came into contact with enemy forces using a rocket-propelled grenade and small arms fire. This heroic son of Illinois was just 22 years old when he passed away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Army Specialist Lowell played football for Lincoln-Way Central High School in New Lenox, Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>He graduated in 2003 and 2 years later enlisted in the Army. According to his family, Jacob joined the Army because he wanted to serve his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in honor of Jacob M. Lowell's service, I urge that we pass without reservation <bill type="h" number="6681">H.R. 6681</bill> and rename the postal facility on Vine Street in New Lenox, Illinois, after this great American serviceman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise this afternoon to pay tribute to a remarkable American and true  hero, Army Specialist Jacob Michael Lowell, from New Lenox, Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was June 2, 2007, and he was on his first patrol of his first tour in Afghanistan with the 173rd Airborne Brigade, working as a gunner when his Humvee was ambushed. To the surprise of no one who knew him, Jacob moved immediately to protect his comrades but was shot and killed. Jacob Michael Lowell was 22.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is appropriate that we rename the post office in his home town in his honor. It will serve as a reminder to those who loved him of his courage and to those who come after him of his character and dedication to his country and fellow citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Army Specialist Lowell was a 2003 graduate of Lincoln-Way Central High School where he played on the offensive line for the school's football team. He was one of those "110 percent guys" who always gave all he had and more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From there, he went to college at Saint Xavier University and from there, in 2005, he enlisted in the Army. He was assigned to the 173rd Airborne in Vicenzia, Italy. It was there he learned to love to jump form planes. He would call home to Illinois and tell his friends and family when and where he would take his next jump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a man who loved doing his job, serving his country and protecting the freedom we hold dear. And that's why I urge all members to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we are here this afternoon to pay tribute to a remarkable American and true hero, Army Specialist Jacob Michael Lowell from New Lenox, Illinois. And to do that, I yield such time as he may consume to my distinguished colleague from the State of Illinois, the author of this bill, Mr. Weller.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6681">H.R. 6681</bill>, legislation I introduced in honor of Jacob M. Lowell to name the New Lenox Post Office in his honor. I also want to thank Chairman Waxman, Ranking Member Tom Davis, my very good friend, Chairman Danny Davis, a member of our Illinois delegation, as well as Ranking Member Kenny Marchant for their support and assistance today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Army Specialist Jacob Michael Lowell is a national hero who gave his life for his country on June 2, 2007, near Gowardesh, Afghanistan, while serving in Operation Enduring Freedom. Today the House will be voting on legislation I introduced with the cosponsorship of the entire Illinois delegation which will designate the New Lenox Post Office the "Jacob M. Lowell New Lenox Post Office Building." I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Army Specialist Jacob Lowell of New Lenox, Illinois, graduated from Lincoln-Way Central High School in 2003. He attended St. Xavier University before heeding the call to serve his country and enlist in the Army in 2005. Specialist Lowell was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment (Air Assault), 173rd Airborne Brigade, Camp Ederle, Italy. He is remembered by his fellow soldiers for being an avid football fan and expressing his support by shouting "Go Bears" at nearly any time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 2, 2007, Jacob Lowell heroically defended his convoy. And as his company commander said, he did his duty all the way up until the end. After already having been hit by small arms fire and facing enemies using rocket-propelled grenades, Specialist Lowell manned a 50-caliber machine gun in defense of many members of his platoon. The wounds he suffered proved to be fatal to Specialist Lowell, but they were not enough to keep him from doing his heroic duty. Those present that day credit Jacob  with saving lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hearing such actions reminds us just how brave our men and women in uniform are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lowell was awarded the Bronze Star with "V" for valor and the Combat Infantryman's Badge for his actions during the firefight, and on May 12, 2008, his fellow soldiers renamed a combat outpost in Nuristan Province after their beloved, fallen comrade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Local veterans have always reminded me that it's important to honor our soldiers and veterans each and every day. By naming the New Lenox Post Office after Jacob, we effectively honor all of them. It should be in the hearts and minds of all those who visit this post office that heroes like Jacob both founded our Nation and stand ready to protect it each and every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our sincerest thanks to Specialist Lowell and to his family, and the honor of renaming this post office could never match the gift which Jacob has given our Nation. This honor merely represents that we should never forget the sacrifice which he and all who have sacrificed their lives serving our Nation have made for each and every one of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that we will all keep the family of Specialist Lowell and those of his fallen comrades in our prayers. I ask again that you will join me in honoring and remembering this extraordinary man whose heroism exemplifies everything that America stands for, and I ask you to support <bill type="h" number="6681">H.R. 6681</bill>, the Jacob Lowell New Lenox Post Office Designation Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I would like to thank Joseph Eannello for his hard work on this legislation and for his work in my office over the past 2 years. He has been an asset in my office and done excellent work for the people of the 11th Congressional District of Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge bipartisan support of this important legislation to honor someone who has sacrificed for our freedoms.</paragraph>
