    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the life of a distinguished public servant, community leader, and friend, Senator Anita Bowser, who passed away at the age of 86 on March 4. Senator Bowser's dedication to the State of Indiana kept her involved in public service throughout her life, and I know that she will be greatly missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Bowser was a good and decent woman who dedicated her life to serving others. From her work as a constitutional scholar to her role as a State representative, her career was filled with acts of conscientious service on behalf of friends, family members, and Hoosiers across Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1980, Senator Bowser retired from teaching political science at Purdue University, North Central, and started her career in the Indiana House of Representatives. In 1992 she was elected to the state senate representing LaPorte and St. Joseph Counties. Throughout her career as an elected official, Senator Bowser addressed issues such as prescription drug assistance, the protection of Indiana's telephone privacy list, support for agricultural development, assistance for victims of sexual assault,  and tax amnesty for small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Governor of Indiana, I had the privilege of seeing firsthand the difference Senator Bowser's efforts have made in our State. The contributions she made through her leadership and philanthropy touched countless lives, and her dedication and strong will made her a role model for a generation of Hoosiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Bowser's many accomplishments include being the first woman to act as house speaker, deputy speaker pro-tempore, in the history of the State. In addition, she received numerous honors based on her public service, including the Louis Ingelhart Award for Freedom of Expression, the Amnesty International Abolitionist of the Year Award, and the Robert Dale Owen Legislator Award from the Indiana Civil Liberties Union. She was also a founding member and the first woman to be hired to teach at  Purdue University, North Central, in Westville. A veteran lawmaker, Senator Bowser was widely respected as the conscience of the Indiana State Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before she died, Senator Bowser was the ranking Democrat on the Senate Pensions and Labor Committee and was a member of the Judiciary Committee, the Corrections, Criminal and Civil Matters Committee, the Ethics Committee, and Education and Career Development Committee. It is a rare person who can make such an impact on so many people over the course of one life. Hoosiers will miss Senator Bowser as a friend, a community leader, and a committed advocate for our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my sad duty to enter the name of Senator Anita Bowser in the official Record of the United States Senate for her service to the State of Indiana.</paragraph>
