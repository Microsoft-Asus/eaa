    <paragraph>Madam President, I was saddened by the news of the death of our former colleague, Jesse Helms of North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a man of strong convictions, even if it meant being in opposition of his own party. He fought for what he believed, and he stood by his word. It was a privilege to work with Senator Helms, even though we disagreed on policy matters, we were able to do what we could for the love of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to this magnificent Senator and a great American, and a true patriot. He will be missed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to my honorable colleague, Senator Jesse Helms. North Carolina's longest serving popularly elected Senator, Jesse was a good friend and a true conservative. I join the entire Nation in mourning his passing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jesse was born in Monroe, NC on October 18, 1921. He attended Wingate University and Wake Forest University and had a successful career in newspapers, first as a sports reporter for The Raleigh Times and later as the paper's city news editor. He also served as a recruiter for the U.S. Navy during World War II and worked in radio and television.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1950s, Helms began to pursue his interest in politics, working on Willis Smith's U.S. Senate campaign and later in his Senate office. Helms also worked on Senator Richard Russell's Presidential campaign and I. Beverly Lake, Sr.'s gubernatorial campaign. After these efforts, Jesse went back to journalism serving as the Capitol Broadcasting Company's executive vice president, vice chairman of the board and assistant chief executive officer. From these positions, Jesse gained local celebrity  as a conservative commentator on the Raleigh-based television station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His notoriety in the area led to a 4-year position on the Raleigh City Council. Jesse remained at the Capitol Broadcasting Company until 1972, when he became the first Republican elected to the Senate from North Carolina in the 20th century. Jesse served North Carolina well as a chairman of both the Agriculture and Foreign Relations Committees. While in the Senate, Jesse was a conservative leader who worked tirelessly for small government, sound foreign policy and strong communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After serving five terms in the U.S. Senate, Jesse retired and returned to North Carolina, where he wrote and published his memoir, Here's Where I Stand. He also continued his work with the Jesse Helms Center, a nonprofit organization started in 1987 to promote the principles Jesse felt so strongly about--democracy, free enterprise and strong values.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my time with Jesse in the Senate, I knew him to be honest, hardworking and committed to the people of North Carolina and this Nation. It is fitting that he passed away on Independence Day, as Jesse was certainly an independent man who loved this country and the values for which it stands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jesse is loved and will be missed by his wife of 66 years, Dorothy; his son Charles; his two daughters, Jane and Nancy; and seven grandchildren. He was an inspiration to many and will be remembered for his dedication and many contributions to North Carolina and this Nation. I ask the entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the life of Jesse Helms.</paragraph>
