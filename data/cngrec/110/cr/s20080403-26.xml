    <paragraph>Mr. President, the turn of the year marked the 20th year the El Malpais Conservation area in western New Mexico has had the benefit of special Federal protection. Two decades ago with the help of the delegation, Congress passed legislation to ensure the protection of this culturally and geographically significant portion of New Mexico, while an amendment of mine allowed the nearby native tribes to continue to utilize the area for their traditional religious and cultural activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Located just south of Grants, between State highways 53 and 117, the El Malpais conservation area is unlike any other in the United States. This unique area is an important cultural resource for the pueblos of Acoma, Laguna, Zuni, and Ramah Navajo. El Malpais, meaning "the badlands," describes the hardened lava plains where molten rock once flowed thousands of years ago. The uneven cooling of these lava flows created many lava tube caves throughout the designation which now provide for a unique  hiking experience. This exceptional conservation area also contains the West Malpais and Cebolla Wilderness areas, spectacular sandstone cliffs and canyons, and a habitat for a multitude of desert vegetation such as aspen, pine, juniper, fir, grasses and cacti. The El Malpais conservation area offers visitors guided tours, picnicking, camping, biking, and horseback riding in designated areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year I was able to help secure $250,000 for the purchase of 200 acres of inholdings at the El Malpais national conservation area. This additional acreage is an important additional step to preserving the history and consolidating the varied landscapes contained within this one of a kind conservation area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our public lands are truly national treasures, and as such, they demand our most thoughtful management. The outdoors in New Mexico reminds us all of the things we hold so dear. I am proud to have played a role in ensuring the expansion and continued protection of El Malpais. This New Mexico treasure remains much the same as it did as so many years ago, and I am glad this will be the case for generations to come.</paragraph>
