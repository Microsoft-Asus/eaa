  <narrative>RETURN OF SENATOR TIM JOHNSON -- (Senate - September 05, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11084">S11084</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me briefly second the observations of the majority leader about the return of our friend, Tim Johnson, from South Dakota. We look forward to welcoming him back after the policy luncheons today. It is a remarkable example of grit and determination to fight his way back. All of us on this side of the aisle are certainly happy he is back and look forward to welcoming him back to the Senate family officially, after the policy lunches.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I may say also--I said this personally to the distinguished Republican leader--Senator McConnell and the entire Republican caucus have been so thoughtful regarding Senator Johnson's illness. There were things the Republican minority could have done to have taken advantage of the situation of his being ill. That was never done, not on one occasion. I appreciate that very much. I know Senator Johnson does. It speaks well for the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think I need to say more on that issue other than it is the right thing to do, but sometimes we try to take advantage of a situation politically. The Republican Senators did not do that, even though there would have been times it would have been to their advantage.</paragraph>
