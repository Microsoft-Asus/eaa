    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the city of Marietta, Georgia on being named one of the Nation's top best communities. The National Civic League has designated Marietta as an All-American city for its exemplary and innovative work to strengthen the community through citizen participation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Marietta was recognized for several programs that cut to the heart of the city's commitment to improving the lives of its residents. The Marietta Reads program helps children develop critical literary skills. The M-STAR program helps reduce crime. And the Marietta Revitalization Program helps to create affordable housing and foster safe communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a tremendous and well-deserved honor, as the citizens of Marietta have put their hearts and souls into strengthening our community. In fact, Marietta is only the fourth Georgia city to ever achieve this distinction in its 57-year history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that when our friends and neighbors come together for the common good, something special happens in our cities. Schools improve, the economy is bolstered, and our streets are safer. I am incredibly proud that Marietta is leading the way on these important initiatives. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the city of Marietta, its Mayor, Bill Dunaway, its members of Council, and especially my councilman, Van Pearlberg.</paragraph>
