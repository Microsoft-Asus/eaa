    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1617">H.R. 1617</bill>, which would name a post office after a true pioneer in Missouri politics and especially for women in politics, Harriett F. Woods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Woods passed away in February. It would be a fitting tribute to name a post office in her honor in the very town where her storied political career began, University City, Missouri. This was also the post office that Ms. Woods used for over 50 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her political career began in the 1960s as a member of the University City Council where she became the first woman appointed to the State Highway Commission. She was elected to the Missouri State Senate in 1976, where she sponsored an equal rights amendment to the State Constitution. While in the State Senate, she also passed landmark legislation which led to drunk driving laws and nursing home reform which became national models adopted throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1984, she was elected Lieutenant Governor, becoming the first woman elected to statewide office in Missouri history. She was a trailblazer for women in politics even after she left elected office. She served 4 years as President of the nonpartisan National Women's Political Caucus. During her tenure, the number of women elected to Congress increased dramatically, including the historic "Year of the Woman" election of 1992.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vivian Eveloff, Director of the nonpartisan Sue Shear Institute for Women in Public Life in St. Louis, described Ms. Woods as a strong advocate "to encourage women of all ages, walks of life and political views to step forward and take on policymaking positions."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Harriett Woods was a role model and inspiration to young people, but especially young women. I am proud to have introduced this legislation to name her hometown post office in her honor, ensuring that her memory and inspiration will continue to be a visible part of our community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The last time I saw our former Lieutenant Governor Woods was in Washington. She was here this past January. Even though she was not feeling well, she made an extraordinary effort to be here for the historic occasion of our new female U.S. Senator, Senator McCaskill, when she was sworn in, and also see the historic occasion of the first woman Speaker sworn into this House. It was very fitting she was here as part of those historic events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make a special thanks to the many cosponsors of this bill honoring Lieutenant Governor Woods, including nearly all women Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle and the Missouri delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all Members of this body to support the legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Harriett Woods, a devoted mother, wife, grandmother, politician, author and community activist, passed away at her home in University City, Missouri, this February of leukemia. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, and raised in Chicago, Illinois, she went on to attend the University of Michigan. It was there that she became the first female editor of the school's highly esteemed student newspaper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In later years, her career and political life proved to be an uphill battle  against more popular-known male politicians. Her political career began as a stay-at-home mom. She went to the city council with a complaint about a noisy manhole cover. When they ignored her, she pushed forward launching a successful petition to have the street closed. Causing the attention of the local press, she earned a job to run a community public affairs panel. Soon after,  she was elected to the University City Council where she served for 8 years. She followed that up with two terms in the Missouri State Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Harriett Woods ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1982, but her name became well known throughout the State. It helped her 2 years later to become the first female elected to statewide office in Missouri when she held the office of Lieutenant Governor. It was a post she held until 1989.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She remained active in politics and her local community throughout the rest of her life, focusing primarily on women's issues. From 1991 to 1995, she was President of the National Women's Political Caucus. Her dedicated work even earned her a spot on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with great pleasure that we honor her today with this post office naming, and I ask all Members to support <bill type="h" number="1617">H.R. 1617</bill> in honor of this great lady.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join with my colleague in consideration of <bill type="h" number="1617">H.R. 1617</bill>, which names a postal facility in University City, Missouri, after Harriett F. Woods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1617">H.R. 1617</bill>, which was introduced by Representative Russ Carnahan on March 21, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1, 2007, by a voice vote. This measure has been cosponsored by 74 Members and has the entire support of the Missouri delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Harriett F. Woods was elected from the 13th District of Missouri in St. Louis County to the Missouri State Senate in November of 1976. She was reelected for a second term in November of 1980. She was the first woman to win statewide offices in Missouri, becoming Lieutenant Governor in 1984. She ran for the U.S. Senate twice in the 1980s, and while both attempts failed, it inspired other women to run for and win political office. Ms. Woods was an activist who promoted women politicians. She  served two terms as President of the National Women's Political Caucus and led the Clinton administration's Coalition for Women Appointments in 1993.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before becoming an elected official, Ms. Woods was an independent film producer and served 10 years as the Public Affairs Director at KPLR-TV in St. Louis. At KPLR, she produced many noted documentaries, among them the award-winning film on child abuse, "Broken Children," "Don't Go to Jail in Missouri" and "Piedmont UFO."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague Russ Carnahan for introducing this legislation and urge its swift passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me share my support for legislation to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 561 Kingsland Avenue in University City, MO, as the "Harriett F. Woods Post Office Building." Harriet Woods will long be remembered as a pioneer in American politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Cleveland, OH, Harriet Woods received a bachelor of arts degree in philosophy from the University of Michigan. She married Jim Woods on January 2, 1953. Before beginning her career in politics, Woods worked as a journalist and television producer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Woods' political career began in 1962, when she became a member of the University City Council. In 1976, she was elected to the Missouri State Senate and was re-elected in 1980. Dedicated to women's participation in government, Woods was the first woman to win statewide office in Missouri when she was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1984. While she was not successful in the two Senate races in which she was a candidate, her actions and leadership inspired hundreds of women nationwide to participate  in politics.</paragraph>
