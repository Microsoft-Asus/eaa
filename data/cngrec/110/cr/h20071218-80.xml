  <narrative>PAYING TRIBUTE TO YOUTH WITH A MISSION -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H16812]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, Youth With a Mission, or YWAM, and the rest of the Nation grieved over the tragic Colorado shootings that resulted in the death and injuries of YWAM's staff and former students. Our deepest sympathy goes out  to the family and friends affected by this terrible tragedy. I rise to honor and encourage YWAM as an international ministry whose largest North American training facility is located in my district at  Garden Valley, Texas, where I visited numerous times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>YWAM trains Christians of many denominations and ages with their express purpose being to know God and to make Him known in obedience to the Great Commission which says they are to go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation. YWAM currently operates in more than 1,000 locations in over 149 countries with a staff of nearly 16,000. I have also had the opportunity on multiple occasions to meet different YWAM staff and students when they have visited this beautiful city here in  Washington, D.C., before embarking on short-term mission trips.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I speak with these individuals, I am overwhelmed by their passion for their ministry and sincere love for people they have yet to meet. They truly strive to follow the example of Christ by offering themselves as selfless, humble, and loving servants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Declaration of Independence says that we are endowed by a Creator with certain inalienable rights. Our Creator endowed this Nation with these individuals who have now been killed. Each of these dear people were a gift to this Earth and to this country. And although we are very disappointed that we did not get to keep those gifts as long as we wished at their Earthly location, we can still thank God for each day that we had them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are not promised life without hardships. To the contrary, those who take up their individual crosses, especially for the sake of Christ, can expect to face greater trials and persecution. For this Nation's entire history, until now, Christians have had a place, a country, where they were not persecuted. But that unique time is changing. In this day of political correctness, often Christians are the only groups it is acceptable to verbally assault. The Apostle Paul reminds us that we should  consider everything a loss, including our own lives, compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage the staff and students at YWAM during this difficult time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>C.S. Lewis had kept a journal of sorts after his precious wife, Joy, had died. In one entry, he said, in effect, that he missed her so much he wanted her back. But he realized how very selfish that was. His wife was in heaven. She was in paradise. It was not in her interest to return to a land of tears from a land where there is no sorrow. Lewis went on to say that we are told Stephen was the first martyr. But he said, as I think about it, didn't Lazarus get the far rawer deal? If you review  the Bible looking for quotes from Lazarus after he was brought back from the dead, you will not find them. I will bet he was not a happy camper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In any event, we can look forward to the day when we can be reunited with these friends from YWAM. But may those at YWAM find strength and encouragement from friends, from each other, and from these words: may God bless those at YWAM and may He continue to shine His face upon them.</paragraph>
