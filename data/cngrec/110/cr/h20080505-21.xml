    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this measure supports the designation of May 5 to May 9, 2008, as National Charter Schools Week and recognizes the growing charter school movement in our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since their inception in 1991, charter schools have grown by leaps and bounds to address various needs of our Nation's public school students. Diverse charter schools across the country offer innovative instruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With site-based control and flexibility, charter schools can make timely decisions about how to structure the school day, which curriculum best suits the needs of their students and, additionally, charter schools may form important partnerships with parents and the surrounding community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week charter schools across the country will celebrate the ninth annual National Charter Schools Week. This year's theme, "Growing Excellence," encourages charter schools to share their successes as part of the effort to reform public education in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today there are almost 4,300 public charter schools operating in 40 States. Their combined force serves over 1.2 million students, and 61 percent of charter schools report significant waiting lists. These waiting lists of nearly 365,000 students nationally are enough to fill over 1,100 new charter schools. Between 300 and 400 new public charter schools open each year, and nearly 150,000 new students enroll in charter schools annually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The growing charter school movement is said to be providing opportunities for many historically underserved communities. Nationally, it is said that charter schools disproportionately serve minority and low-income students. It is reported that 58 percent of charter school students are minorities, and 52 percent qualify for free and reduced-price lunch, and many charter schools are able to achieve impressive academic results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="1168">H. Res. 1168</bill> expresses support for National Charter Schools Week and recognizes the charter school movement's 16-year history providing public education options based on innovation, flexibility and community partnerships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee urges our colleagues to pass this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1168, congratulating charter schools and their students, parents, teachers and administrators across the United States for their ongoing contributions to education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week has been designated as the ninth annual National Charter Schools Week, and it is entirely appropriate that we take a few minutes to recognize the contributions that charter schools make every day in the lives of millions of children. Charter schools are innovative public schools with a simple interest in providing a quality education to children in their community. They explore new educational approaches, such as longer school days or an extended school year, and are free from most  rules and regulations governing conventional public schools. Every day, however, charter schools face unarguable facts of free-market pressures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Unlike traditional public schools, charter schools must demonstrate the success of their students' academic achievements to parents, policymakers, and their communities or they face closure. From the time the first charter school opened its doors, they have risen to the challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, charter schools made an important contribution to rebuild and strengthen Louisiana after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, particularly in New Orleans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More often than not, charter schools meet the student achievement and accountability requirements under No Child Left Behind in the same manner as traditional public schools, but often set higher individual goals to ensure that they are of high quality and truly accountable to the public. Yet despite these innovative approaches and promising reports of parental satisfaction, charter schools across the country have struggled through a myriad of obstacles to create successful schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should support the $272.6 million included in the President's fiscal year 2009 budget request for the public charter school programs authorized under No Child Left Behind. These programs provide key points in the development of charter schools, helping cover the extraordinary costs of launching successful charters, disseminating their successful innovations to other public schools, and providing financial incentives to State governments and private lenders that help enable schools to build  and renovate facilities. These programs have been a tremendous success helping to create public charter schools all across the country that work to improve academic achievement for low-income students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that the charter community will continue to build on its 15-year history of providing a high-quality option in public education that is based on innovation, freedom from red tape, and partnership between parents and educators, an option that is giving new hope to disadvantaged and minority families across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
