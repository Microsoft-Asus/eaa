  <speaking speaker="300098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to honor and congratulate my friend and long-time civil rights activist, the Reverend Dr. Otis Moss, Jr. The church which he currently pastors recently celebrated 75 years of service to the Cleveland community. In July 2007, Reverend Moss will celebrate 32 years of pastoral service to the Olivet congregation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Moss pastors the Olivet Institutional Baptist Church in the Fairfax neighborhood of my hometown of Cleveland, OH. Since 1931, Olivet has been more than a place of worship and Christian fellowship in the African-American community. It has been dedicated to preaching, teaching, and practicing the unconditional love of Jesus Christ. And as a centerpiece of the community, it has nurtured leaders who have championed civil rights and equality for the poor, and it has worked to increase awareness  about poverty, health care, employment, education, and human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Georgia, Otis Moss, Jr., was born on February 26, 1935, to Otis and Magnolia Moss. He earned his bachelor's degree from Morehouse College in 1956 and his master of divinity degree from the Morehouse School of Religion/Inter-denominational Theological Center in 1959. He also completed special studies at the Inter-denominational Theological Center from 1960 to 1961 and earned his doctorate in ministry from the United Theological Seminary in 1990.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Moss's tenure as pastor began in 1954 in LaGrange, GA at Mount Olive Baptist Church. While leading Mount Olive, Moss also served as pastor of Atlanta's Providence Baptist Church from 1956 to 1959. He then headed to Ohio, where he was the pastor for Mount Zion Baptist Church in Lockland. In 1971, Reverend Moss served as copastor with the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Sr., at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. Olivet Institutional Baptist Church extended the invitation to Reverend  Moss to be their pastor in December 1974. He was installed as pastor in 1975.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Moss has been involved in advocating civil and human rights and social justice issues for most of his adult life. Having been a staff member for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., he formerly served as a national board member and trustee for the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Non-Violent Social Change. His work in the international community has taken him around the world to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, and Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moss is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Role Model of the Year Award from the National Institute for Responsible Fatherhood and Family Development in 1992, the Leadership Award from the Cleveland chapter of the American Jewish Committee in 1996, and, most recently, he was inducted into the 2007 Class of the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame located at the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site in Atlanta. He also holds six honorary degrees from colleges and universities  in Ohio, Georgia, and Arkansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His political and civic engagement runs deep. Moss has served as chairman of the board of trustees at Morehouse College and as a member of the board of trustees at the United Theological Seminary in Dayton, OH. He was an advisor to former President Jimmy Carter at Camp David and was the special guest of President Bill Clinton at a peace treaty signing between Israel and Jordan in 1994. Former Ohio Governor Richard Celeste awarded Moss the 1983 Governor's Award in Civil Rights, and I had the honor  of presenting Reverend Moss with the 1993 Governor's Award in Civil Rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His service to Ohio and the Nation has also been recognized by the Ohio House of Representatives, Ebony Magazine, Cleveland Press, the Black Professional Association of Cleveland, the American Red Cross of Greater Cleveland, Project Love: Remember the Children Foundation, The Cleveland Jewish Committee, and Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. He is a life member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoples, NAACP, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., and Sigma Pi Phi, Boule, to  name a few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>University Hospitals Health System honored Reverend Moss with a special medical center partnership bearing his name. In 1997, the Otis Moss Jr.-University Hospitals Medical Center was established in conjunction with the Olivet Institutional Baptist Church. The center offers a wide range of primary and specialty care medical services and features an on-site laboratory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Moss and I share a passion for helping our children reach their full potential and lead our Nation and world into the next century and beyond. In 2003, I had the privilege of touring and visiting with Moss and his staff at the Medical Center to see how a program called "Reach Out and Read" is administered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Moss enjoyed an abiding friendship with the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In fact, Dr. King visited the pulpit of Olivet Institutional Baptist Church on several occasions and performed the wedding ceremony for Reverend and Mrs. Moss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps the greatest connection I share with Reverend Moss is the love and appreciation we both have for our wives. Reverend Moss is married to the former Edwina Hudson Smith, who is accomplished in her own right and is the recipient of numerous awards and recognitions. She is recognized for her outstanding commitment to service as a member of the National Board of the American Red Cross. Their love is a model for us all. Sadly, Reverend Moss and I also share in the loss of a young child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As someone who has had the pleasure of knowing and working with Reverend Dr. Otis Moss, Jr., I have seen how far his works have reached and benefited others. He has made significant contributions to his community, the State of Ohio, our Nation, and our world. Reverend Moss has shown that he lives in accordance with his strong faith in God. He is someone all of us would do well to emulate, and I am pleased and proud to salute him, his wife, their children, and grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Reverend Moss, for your outstanding commitment and exceptional leadership to our community. Our lives are better as a result of having been touched by you. Congratulations again to you and your Olivet family for your devotion and commitment to the Cleveland community.</paragraph>
