    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today I would like to share with the Chamber a very significant moment in our history. Eighty-seven years ago today, on June 20, 1921, Congresswoman Alice Robertson became the first woman to sit in the chair and preside over this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was a pioneer, an educator, a public servant, and only the second woman ever elected to Congress. She is a testament to the power of the 19th amendment and a symbol of the full participation that women have enjoyed in government ever since its passage. Today, women occupy many seats in this Chamber, even the Speaker's Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we owe much to Alice Robertson, and I ask that you join me in celebrating her legacy and giving thanks to the memory of this wonderful Oklahoma woman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
