    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our Nation's veterans. The GI bill has provided education to many of our Nation's fine, honorable men and women. Unfortunately, there is a provision which excludes our National Guard and Reserve from receiving their GI bill benefits after they have left the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have introduced bipartisan legislation, <bill type="h" number="1330">H.R. 1330</bill>, which will give the National Guard and Reserve members up to 10 years to take advantage of their GI bill education benefits. This proposal is similar to the benefits extended to active duty members of the military right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill extends a much-deserved and needed benefit to our troops. Because the National Guard and Reserve are playing an ever-increasing role in combat operations, they are finding it harder to achieve their educational goals while they are enlisted. This bill will better allow troops to serve their country honorably and then reward them with higher education when they return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Guard and Reserve are becoming indistinguishable from the active duty now. They are in need of this benefit. We owe this to our troops and to our military families back home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all Members of Congress who care about our troops and military families to sign on to this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
