    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the Kean University Cougars baseball team's dramatic victory in the 2007 NCAA Division III National Championships. Bringing joy to the more than 13,000 Kean University students and all of the Cougar fans in Union, NJ, Kean University capped off their impressive season with a thrilling 5-to-4 victory in the 10th inning of the championship game. The victory ushered in the Cougars' first baseball championship title and was the culmination  of an inspiring undefeated run through the postseason.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the season the team played with courage and determination. Boasting a roster with 28 New Jerseyans, the Cougars finished in first place in the New Jersey Athletic Conference, NJAC, with an impressive record of 15 wins and only 3 losses, best in the conference. Although the Cougars fell to the College of New Jersey in the conference championships, the team recovered quickly and finished the season with an overall record of 43 wins and 8 losses and the national championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Championship baseball requires strong leadership, and under coach Neil Ioviero, the Cougars played team baseball that allowed them to realize their full potential. With the help of assistant coaches Jamie Ioviero, Lewis France, Jack Nagy, Francisco Romero, and Frank Beckhorn, the coaching staff created a winning environment and offered the guidance that allowed the Cougars to excel on the field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The entire Cougars squad played with heart and the championship was truly a team effort. I would like to congratulate and commend all of the players on the Kean University 2007 Division III Championship Team: Maikel De La Rosa, Ryan Clark, Joseph Augustine, Mike Shymanski, Keith Kwiatek, Aaron Richard, Joseph D'Andrea, Eric Ammirata, Perry Schatzow, Chris Carrano, Thomas Paglione, Brandon Aich, Mike Manganiello, Kevin O'Neill, Kyle Murphy, Andrew Cupido, Colin Feneis, Matt Donaghue, Derek Gianakas,  Mark Blevins, Dan Mattonelli, Matt Grinkevich, Joe Rizzo, Tim Lowe, Daniel Zeffiro, Joe Bartlinski, Matt Merrigan, Nick Nolan and Nick Cesare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on behalf of the State of New Jersey I am honored to congratulate the Cougars for their NCAA Division III Championship season. They played hard and displayed an admirable commitment to competition and sportsmanship that instills a sense of pride in the students of Kean University, the team's fans, and the people of my State.</paragraph>
