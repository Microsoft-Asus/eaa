    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I congratulate in the Record the men and women who serve at the Marine Corps Logistics Command's Maintenance Center in Albany, GA, for being selected for the second time to receive the Robert T. Mason Depot Maintenance Excellence Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Robert T. Mason Depot Maintenance Excellence Award is named for the former Assistant Deputy Secretary of Defense of Maintenance Policy, Programs and Resources who was a champion of organic depot maintenance for three decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, the Marine Corps Logistics Command's Maintenance Center in Albany, GA, was the inaugural winner of this award for Depot Maintenance Excellence. That year's recipient was the Design and Manufacture Vehicle Armor Protective Kits Program of the Maintenance Center in Albany, Georgia, for its support of the Global War on Terror. This program provided protective armor kits for U.S. Marine Corps combat vehicles, allowing the Marines to be a more effective fight force and had a direct impact  on their safety and morale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, the award went to the Dedicated Design and Prototype Effort Team of the Maintenance Center in Albany, Georgia. They provide exceptional and responsive maintenance support by demonstrating the ability to be responsive, resourceful, agile and creative by designing and prototyping multiple systems in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to acknowledge the great achievement of these men and women of the Marine Corps Logistics Command's Maintenance Center who provide support for our men and women fighting the global war on terror.</paragraph>
