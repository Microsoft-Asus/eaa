  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, since July of last year, Kim Olive has served as the communications director for the Second Congressional District of South Carolina. I am grateful to say that she has done an excellent job serving on the staff. Kim has consistently been innovative in doing her duties, and her creativity, dedication and tenacity will be difficult to replace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kim began her time in Washington, DC, interning for Cassidy &amp; Associates. She then came to Capitol Hill and interned for Congressman ROY BLUNT and worked for Senator RICHARD SHELBY and Congressman SPENCER BACHUS, both of Alabama, Kim's home State. After serving the people of the Second Congressional District for nearly a year, Kim will be leaving for the west coast to work in California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An honors graduate of the University of Alabama, Kim is one of two children of Larry and Norene Olive of Florence, Alabama. She is a credit to the people of South Carolina and Alabama, and I wish her Godspeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.</paragraph>
