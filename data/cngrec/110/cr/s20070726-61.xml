    <bill type="sr" number="282">S. Res. 282</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas polycystic kidney disease (known as "PKD") is 1 of the most prevalent life-threatening genetic diseases in the United States, is a severe, dominantly inherited disease that has a devastating impact, in both human and economic terms, on people of all ages, and affects equally people of all races, sexes, nationalities, geographic locations, and income levels; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, based on prevalence estimates by the National Institutes of Health, it is estimated that about 600,000 patients in the United States have a genetic inheritance from 1 or both parents for polycystic kidney disease, and that countless additional friends, loved ones, spouses, and caregivers must shoulder the physical, emotional, and financial burdens that polycystic kidney disease causes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas polycystic kidney disease, for which there is no treatment or cure, is the leading genetic cause of kidney failure in the United States and the 4th leading cause overall;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the vast majority of polycystic kidney disease patients reach kidney failure at an average age of 53, causing a severe strain on dialysis and kidney transplantation resources and on the delivery of health care in the United States, as the largest segment of the population of the United States, the "baby boomers", continues to age;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas end stage renal disease is one of the fastest growing components of the Medicare budget, and polycystic kidney disease contributes to that cost by an estimated $2,000,000,000 annually for dialysis, kidney transplantation, and related therapies;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a systemic disease that causes damage to the kidney and the cardiovascular, endocrine, hepatic, and gastrointestinal organ systems and instills in patients a fear of an unknown future with a life-threatening genetic disease and apprehension over possible genetic discrimination;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the severity of the symptoms of polycystic kidney disease and the limited public awareness of the disease cause many patients to live in denial and forego regular visits to their physicians or to avoid following good health management which would help avoid more severe complications when kidney failure occurs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas people who have chronic, life-threatening diseases like polycystic kidney disease have a predisposition to depression and its resultant consequences due to their anxiety over pain, suffering, and premature death;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Senate and taxpayers of the United States desire to see treatments and cures for disease and would like to see results from investments in research conducted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and from such initiatives as the NIH Roadmap to the Future;</narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a verifiable example of how collaboration, technological innovation, scientific momentum, and public-private partnerships can generate therapeutic interventions that directly benefit polycystic kidney disease sufferers, save billions of Federal dollars under Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs for dialysis, kidney transplants, immunosuppressant drugs, and related therapies, and make available several thousand openings on the kidney transplant waiting  list;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas improvements in diagnostic technology and the expansion of scientific knowledge about polycystic kidney disease have led to the discovery of the 3 primary genes that cause polycystic kidney disease and the 3 primary protein products of the genes and to the understanding of cell structures and signaling pathways that cause cyst growth that has produced multiple polycystic kidney disease clinical drug trials;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas there are thousands of volunteers nationwide who are dedicated to expanding essential research, fostering public awareness and understanding of polycystic kidney disease, educating polycystic kidney disease patients and their families about the disease to improve their treatment and care, providing appropriate moral support, and encouraging people to become organ donors; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas these volunteers engage in an annual national awareness event held during the 3rd week of September, and such a week would be an appropriate time to recognize National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the Senate--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) designates the week of September 9-16, 2007, as "National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) supports the goals and ideals of a national week to raise public awareness and understanding of polycystic kidney disease (known as "PKD");&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) recognizes the need for additional research into a cure for polycystic kidney disease; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (4) encourages the people of the United States and interested groups to support National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week through appropriate ceremonies and activities, to promote public awareness of polycystic kidney disease and to foster understanding of the impact of the disease on patients and their families.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Hatch to introduce a resolution to increase awareness of Polycystic Kidney Disease, PKD, a common and life threatening genetic illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 600,000 people have been diagnosed with PKD nationwide including 10,000 people in my home State of Wisconsin. There is no treatment or cure for PKD. Families and friends struggle to fight this disease and provide unwavering support to their loved ones suffering from PKD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there is hope. The PKD Foundation has led the fight for increased research and patient education. Recent studies have led to the discovery of the genes that cause PKD as well as promising clinical drug trials for treatment. More needs to be done and the Government wants to help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to increase public awareness of this fatal disease, I propose that September 9 through 16 be designated as "National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week." This week coincides with the annual walk for PKD which takes place every September. In Wisconsin, residents gather across the State to take part in this very special walk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increasing awareness will help all those affected by this terrible disease. I hope my colleagues will support this important resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, along with my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Herb Kohl, a resolution to designate the week of September 9-16, 2007, as "National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution acknowledges the dangers of Polycystic Kidney Disease, also called PKD, which affects over 600,000 Americans. That is more than three times the population of Salt Lake City.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PKD is the most common, life-threatening genetic disease in the U.S. There is no cure, and it is one of the four leading causes of kidney failure, also called end-stage renal disease; diabetes being number one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Polycystic kidney disease is characterized by the growth of numerous fluid-filled cysts in the kidney, which slowly reduce the kidney function and can eventually lead to kidney failure. When PKD causes kidneys to fail, the patient requires dialysis or kidney transplantation. About one-half of people with the major type of PKD progress to kidney failure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PKD is especially personal to me because so many Utahns suffer from this disease. The PKD Foundation claims that approximately 5,000 individuals in Utah live with PKD, and that the incidence of end-stage renal disease in Utah is three times that of the national average. To cure PKD would result in billions of dollars in savings to the military, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Veterans Administration for dialysis, transplantation and related treatments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Due to the illusiveness of PKD, many people are simply unaware of the nature of this disease. A National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week will help spread the word about the deadliness of PKD and vast numbers of, not only Utahns, but all Americans affected by this disease. With education comes the ability to know how to help people. Let us make it possible for everyone to know about PKD, so that more people can join the effort in making PKD a disease of the past.</paragraph>
