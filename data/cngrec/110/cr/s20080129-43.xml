    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak about justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, in coordination with the Targum Shlishi Foundation, is conducting Operation: Last Chance, a final effort to bring the most guilty Nazis to justice before they die. The perpetrators of the Holocaust must not be allowed to cheat their deserved fate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The uniqueness of the Holocaust crime lies not wholly in its number of  victims, though that number was horrifyingly large. Its singularity is also the reality of a modern government's methodically executed plan to annihilate an entire race, an effort that is now one of the greatest crimes against humanity the world has ever seen. Even in a century where so much blood was shed--in China, Russia, Africa, and the Middle East--the Holocaust stands alone.  For the victims of the Holocaust were chosen not based on any threat to the state, real or imaginary. Indeed, some victims had served with distinction in the German Army during the First World War, and many had then given their lives for their country. They were chosen instead simply for who they were, one of the most ancient peoples to grace this Earth, and one which has never before come so perilously close to utter oblivion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Historians have argued for years about why and how the Holocaust occurred. But for the survivors, and even more for victims, that question is entirely secondary. There is only the reality of the crime and the ongoing quest for justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can argue about which Nazi organizations are the most culpable and which were relatively ignorant. As the Nuremburg war crimes trials showed, all Germans are not guilty, and not all are innocent. In some cases, the line blurs slightly. But that does not mean the line does not exist because some--many, perhaps all--are certainly guilty. The Einsatzgruppen. The concentration camp guards. The SS. The bureaucrats who signed off on orders with little thought of the immense crime which they were  committing. For these people, there can be no amnesty. There can be no looking away. There must be justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, after the war, many of the guilty scattered to the four corners of the earth. Some, like Klaus Barbie, fled to South America. Others remained in Germany, Austria, and the Balkans, where successor governments to the Axis gradually lost interest in prosecution. Many fled to the United States, which had only finished fighting the Nazi threat when it faced a resurgent Soviet threat. The Cold War diverted, partially, the Western governments from bringing Nazi killers to justice. Living  in homes across the United States and Europe, working at normal jobs and raising families, the most culpable killers may have thought they escaped a reckoning. And, for a time, they did. The Government was certainly not looking for them. But one man was. One man had himself been a prisoner in those terrible camps and had seen firsthand the horrors perpetrated there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simon Wiesenthal began searching for Nazis and documenting the crimes of them after World War II, and continued for many years. The Simon Wiesenthal Center was founded in 1977 and has an impressive track record of combating modern bigotry and antisemitism, promoting human rights, and ensuring the safety of Jews worldwide. These efforts complement Simon Wiesenthal's life's work in hunting Nazi fugitives and trying to repair, in part, the damage of the Holocaust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, however, the hour grows late. It is now almost 63 years since the end of World War II. Every week, Nazi criminals are passing away, 80 and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>90-year-old men escaping the long arm of justice. Many of the host countries in which they reside are grateful for this quiet end, avoiding uncomfortable legal proceedings and revisiting old specters from the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the easy way is almost never the right way. In these later days, it is incumbent on all of us to help finish the task Simon Wiesenthal began decades ago. In view of the dwindling time available, the center launched Operation Last Chance in 2002, which is aimed at finding Nazi fugitives in the Baltic states, Poland, Romania, Germany, Austria, Croatia, and Hungary. There is much work to do: the opening of the Soviet archives since 1991 offers a magnificent opportunity to identify some of the  most guilty Nazis, previously hidden behind the Iron Curtain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Operation Last Chance is fittingly named, after a final opportunity to bring those remaining Nazis to earthly justice before they meet eternal justice. To date Wiesenthal Center has identified nearly 500 war crimes suspects, 99 of whom have been turned over to prosecutors. Operation Last Chance primarily focuses on offering rewards for the location and arrest of such criminals as Dr. Sandor Kepiro, a Hungarian police official; Milivoj Asner, a police chief in fascist Croatia; Charles--Karoly--Zentai,  a fascist Croatian city governor; Erna Wallisch, a German concentration camp guard; and many others; and Dr. Aribeit Heim was nicknamed "Dr. Death" for the medical murders and torture he inflicted on hundreds of concentration camp inmates. He is at large, and his whereabouts unknown. Finding him, and prosecuting all of the wanted Nazi criminals, is a task of the utmost moral importance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The roadblocks are many, and the shortcuts few. This late hour demands that the U.S. Government make every effort to help with Operation Last Chance. I call upon the President and Secretary Rice to make it clear to our European and South American allies that we will not tolerate footdragging on extradition orders, deportation, and criminal indictments. We will not tolerate the easy way. We demand that they commit the resources of the U.S. Government to this cause that our descendents will not  look back on us and say: In the end, they did too little. In the end, they turned away.</paragraph>
