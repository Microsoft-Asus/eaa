  <narrative>IN RECOGNITION OF DANNY WOODHEAD -- (Senate - May 08, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3974">S3974</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300077" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a young Nebraskan who recently became a member of the New York Jets, after completing a remarkable 4-year run into the National Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA, record books as the all-time leading rusher at any level of college football.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Danny Woodhead, a senior tailback for Chadron State College in Nebraska, completed his college football career with 7,962 yards rushing to top the previous all-division record by more than 600 yards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not the only NCAA record set by this native son from North Platte, NE. During the 2006 season, Danny set the single-season record for rushing for all NCAA divisions as he rushed for 2,756 yards on 344 carries. He became the first player in NCAA history to ever rush for more than 2,700 yards in a season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Danny Woodhead also ranks second in the Nation in career all-purpose yardage, with 9,479 yards. His 109 career touchdowns tie the NCAA record, and his 654 career points rank him second.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For his outstanding football achievements, Danny Woodhead was awarded the Harlon Hill Trophy for the second year in a row. Similar to the Heisman, the Harlon Hill Trophy is given annually to the college football player of the year in NCAA Division II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State of Nebraska has a storied college football tradition; but no one has ever witnessed a running back compile the prodigious statistics that Danny Woodhead, a math education major, did during his career with the Eagles. Although he played for a small college in a rural state, his abilities caught the attention of the sporting world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Nebraska are proud of Danny Woodhead and his remarkable achievements, and we look forward to watching him pursue his dreams in football and beyond.</paragraph>
