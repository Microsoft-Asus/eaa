    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, the Democrats have had control of the Congress now for a year and a half. We are still waiting for an energy plan. We are going to celebrate Memorial Day this weekend. We are still waiting for an energy plan. What have the Democrats done so far as an energy plan? Well, let's just take a look at it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a spoon from the House cafeteria. They bought this spoon at great expense to the taxpayers, and it is a green spoon. In fact, it melts in your coffee. This is Exhibit 1. What have the Democrats done when gas is $4? Well, go down to the gift store and you will see these Green the Capitol bags. So now we have, at greater expense to the taxpayer, printed these little Green the Capitol bags.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now what is the centerpiece of their energy policy when you're going to pay $4 a gallon and more around the country for gasoline? They are going to change the light and green the light on the top of the Capitol. Just the study, I'm told, is going to be $800,000, and then millions of dollars. And $4 gas.</paragraph>
