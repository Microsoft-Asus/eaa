    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week President Bush vetoed a bipartisan bill enacted pursuant to the authority vested in Congress by article I of the Constitution that would provide private health insurance to 10 million low-income children here in America. His reason, the bill was too big.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the President refuses to fund health care for our Nation's low-income children, he has no problem sending billions of dollars to Iraq with absolutely no questions asked. Today alone, the President will spend $300 million funding the occupation of Iraq. With that money, we could insure 246,000 low-income kids. Over the next month, the President will spend a whopping $9 billion in Iraq, which would allow us to insure 7.4 million kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, time and time again, congressional Republicans have approved blank checks for the President to send billions to Iraq, and now they are concerned about $35 billion for improving the lives of 10 million low-income children? It is time they reevaluate their priorities and join us next week in overriding President Bush's veto.</paragraph>
