    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as Maria Ortiz and her daughter Vanessa were driving down the Eastex Freeway in Kingwood, Texas, on Sunday afternoon, they were probably talking about the upcoming birth of Vanessa's baby boy Nathaniel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ignacio Gomez-Gutierrez was blasting down that same freeway in his pick-up truck. He came up behind Maria and Vanessa and slammed his truck into the back of their car, smashing the trunk into the front seat, killing them both, Maria, Vanessa and also Nathaniel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gomez-Gutierrez was three times the legal limit drunk. Witnesses who were following him driving stated that he was so drunk he could barely hold his head up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After this coward killed the Ortizes, he fled from his pick-up and ran, but he was finally captured and held for the police by a bystander.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gomez-Gutierrez had already been convicted three times for drunk driving, and he was an illegal from Mexico. But he had been never been deported after any of his convictions. If he had, Maria, Vanessa, and the baby would still be here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How many more Americans and legal immigrants need to be killed before the Feds start deporting these criminal illegals?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
