  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague and committee ranking member, Senator Chambliss, to offer the Pesticide Registration Improvement Renewal Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will reauthorize and amend the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act we enacted in 2003 to control the collection and disbursement of fees collected in the pesticide registration process. This legislation extends the authority for the Environmental Protection Agency to collect maintenance fees for the reregistration of pesticides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is agreed upon by a broad array of stakeholders, including the manufacturers, environmental groups and agricultural producers. This legislation ensures that these chemicals are reevaluated in a timely manner, while covering the costs of the EPA workers who carry out this important work. This bill has no budgetary impact and should not be controversial. I ask my colleagues to support this important measure.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
