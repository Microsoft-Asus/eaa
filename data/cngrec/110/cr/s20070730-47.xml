    <paragraph>Madam President, this resolution concerns a request for testimony and representation in trespass actions in Denver County Court in Denver, CO. In these actions, protesters have been charged with trespassing in the building housing Senator Ken Salazar's Denver, CO, office on February 21, 2007, for refusing repeated requests by the police to leave the premises. Trials on charges of trespass are scheduled to commence on August 22, 2007. The defense has subpoenaed a member of the  Senator's staff who had conversations with the defendant protesters during the charged events. Senator Salazar would like to cooperate by providing testimony from his staff. This resolution would authorize that staff member, and any other employee of Senator Salazar's office from whom evidence may be required, to testify in connection with these actions, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel.</paragraph>
