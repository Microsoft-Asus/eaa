FEASIBILITY STUDY, PROJECT DEVELOPMENT, COST SHARE.</narrative>
  <narrative> (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as "Secretary"), in consultation and cooperation with the City of San Diego and the Sweetwater Authority, is authorized to undertake a study to determine the feasibility of constructing a four reservoir intertie system to improve water storage opportunities, water supply reliability, and water yield of the existing non-Federal water storage system. The feasibility study shall document the Secretary's engineering,  environmental, and economic investigation of the proposed reservoir and intertie project taking into consideration the range of potential solutions and the circumstances and needs of the area to be served by the proposed reservoir and intertie project, the potential benefits</narrative>
  <narrative> The authority of the Secretary to carry out any provisions of this Act shall terminate 10 years after the date of the enactment of this Act. &lt;p&gt;</narrative>

    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1803">H.R. 1803</bill>, introduced by Congressman Duncan Hunter, would direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a feasibility study to design and construct a four-reservoir intertie system. This intertie system will improve the water storage opportunities and water supply reliability for the City of San Diego and the Sweetwater Authority, the third largest water retailer in San Diego County. Similar legislation was passed by the House in the 109th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have no objection to this noncontroversial bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1803">H.R. 1803</bill> and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This important legislation was introduced by our colleagues from California, President--not President yet--Duncan Hunter and Susan Davis, both colleagues here in Congress. It represents the first step in expanding increasingly scarce water supplies for the citizens of the San Diego area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to assess the feasibility of constructing an intertie system between four reservoirs. Several of these reservoirs are significantly below capacity in most years. Once interconnected, water could then be transported to the unused space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Growing populations and reduced water storage opportunities require us to make efficient use of the supplies that we have, and this bill does just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this noncontroversial bill, which also passed the House in the last Congress. It also follows the adage that an east Texan once told me, "Use what you got." This will allow us to do that. I urge support of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="1803">H.R. 1803</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
