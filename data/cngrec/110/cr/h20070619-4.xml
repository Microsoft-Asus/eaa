    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize the great work and contribution of the Society of Iranian-American Women for Education, a scholarship fund in southeast Texas that serves the greater academic community. The Society's mission is to promote Iranian culture through educational seminars, films, lectures, and exhibitions, but their most important goal is to provide educational support and assistance through scholarships for hardworking students. To date, more than 170 such scholarships  have been awarded to students attending schools in Texas. The Society is also dedicated to strengthening relationships and deepening the understanding between Iranians and Americans, and has hosted many esteemed speakers, including Nobel Laureate Dr. Shirin Ebadi and Anousheh Ansari, who recently completed her own space flight. I salute the Society for their dedication to academics and achievement, and wish them future success in all their wonderful endeavors.</paragraph>
