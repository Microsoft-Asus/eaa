  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the accomplishments of Maxine Pierce Frost, a longtime community leader in Riverside, CA, and nationally renown leader in education. This month, Maxine Frost will retire from the Riverside Unified School District after 40 years of dedicated service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1967, Maxine Frost has provided leadership to her community, the State of California, and our Nation. As a board member of the Riverside Unified School District, Frost has seen great change in education policy throughout her tenure. Being a member of the first large school district in the Nation to voluntarily desegregate, she has helped pave the way for similar changes across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout periods of intense growth in the State and the region, Maxine Frost has worked diligently to ensure that students and educators are provided with adequate resources. The Riverside Unified School District has grown from roughly 23,000 students to 43,000 students during Frost's tenure. Throughout this period of intense growth, she has maintained her resolve that every student have the resources they need to succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Numerous academic committees across the State of California and our Nation have benefitted from the leadership and experience of Maxine Frost. She has held a number of leadership posts: president of the Pacific Region of National School Boards Association, the California School Boards Association Legislative Network, the California Association of Suburban School Districts, the Schools Accrediting Commissions, the Council for Basic Education, and the California Association of Student Council's  Board of Directors. In 1981, after serving as president of the California School Boards Association, California Governor George Deukmejian appointed her to the Education Commission of the States, in which she served alongside future President William Jefferson Clinton, who chaired the commission at that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On October 16, 2006, the Riverside Unified School District adopted a resolution to designate one of its elementary schools as, Maxine Frost Elementary School, in honor of her longtime service and dedication to the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As she retires from four decades of service and dedication to the students, families, and educators of California and our Nation, I am pleased to ask my colleagues to join me in thanking her for her fine work. Her tremendous leadership will be long remembered.</paragraph>
