    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize one of my constituents, Tammi Mackeben, who has been named the 2008 School Counselor of the Year by the American School Counselor Association. Mrs. Mackeben was also named the Texas Multi-Level School Counselor of the year by the Texas School Counselor Association in 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The School Counselor of the Year contest is open to all 100,000 members of the school counseling profession. Mrs. Mackeben was nominated for this award by Principal Ricardo Damian and was evaluated by a select panel of industry experts on several criteria including: creative school counseling innovations, effective counseling programs, leadership skills and their contribution to student advancement. Mrs. Mackeben is 1 of 10 finalists from across the Nation, and the only representative from Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Mackeben has worked as a counselor at the Ernesto Serna Two Way Dual Language School in El Paso, TX, for 7 years. She and her colleague Norma Guerra are responsible for counseling close to 700 students in grades kindergarten through eighth grade. Mrs. Mackeben works with students in the sixth through eighth grades, helping them to navigate personal and academic challenges, and preparing them to continue their education in high school. Both Mrs. Mackeben and Ms. Guerra have implemented Comprehensive  Developmental Guidance and Counseling on their campus. The Guidance and Counseling Program received the CREST Award--Counselors Reinforcing Excellence for Students in Texas--from the Texas School Counselor Association and the RAMP Award--Recognized ASCA Model Program--from the American School Counselor Association during the 2006-2007 school year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The guidance, support and compassion that Mrs. Mackeben shares in her daily work is perhaps one of the best gifts a teacher can offer to her students. For all this and for being such a great Texan, I can only say: Thank You, Mrs. Mackeben!</paragraph>
