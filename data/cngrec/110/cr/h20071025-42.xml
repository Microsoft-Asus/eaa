  <narrative>BE PREPARED -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12095]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, "Be prepared" is the motto of the Boy Scouts of America. Unfortunately, for those Californians now in harm's way, the leadership of the U.S. Forest Service doesn't have the same commitment. Three years ago, the fleet of airplanes with firefighting capabilities available to the Forest Service declined dramatically, due to both attrition and accidents. I contacted the head of the Forest Service and aggressively suggested that steps be taken to ensure a surge capability  in firefighting aircraft should a major conflagration erupt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much to my chagrin, the leadership at the National Forest Service was not responsive and our fire fighting aviation assets were permitted to dwindle. I continued to push the case for preparedness, focusing on the certification of specially designed Russian firefighting airplanes, so that water bombers would be available if our own depleted air assets were insufficient to handle an emergency. The availability of large American aircraft, like the DC-10, converted for firefighting purposes, was  also suggested as a possible backup should the current number of firefighting aircraft prove inadequate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bureaucratic response from the U.S. Forest Service was disheartening, which is an understatement. The leadership did everything they could not to do anything. They bent over backwards to justify not taking steps to be prepared for the worst scenario. It appeared to be "good ol' boyism" and bureaucratic obstructionism with a vengeance. After all my pleas and demands, the Forest Service refused to take the steps necessary to be prepared for the worst. That intransigence was the order of the  day at the Forest Service as late as December of last year, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of California are now suffering. It was only the intervention of Gov. Schwarzenegger that kept the privately developed fire fighting DC-10 available for the awe-inspiring part it is now playing in the current battle against the flames that have engulfed huge chunks of California. That DC-10, however, as well as the Russian waterbombers, is still not permitted to fight fires on the Federal lands in California, or elsewhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the fire is extinguished and an-evaluation is done, one thing that must be determined is whether or not a lack of aviation fire-fighting capacity undercut the courageous efforts of those confronting this enormous blazing inferno. Did people lose their homes because the waterbombers weren't there to save the day? One way or the other, those who made the decision to do nothing at the U.S. Forest Service will be held accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, September 29, 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHIEF BOSWORTH: I write once again regarding the issue of the availability, in case of emergency, of the Russian fleet of firefighting aircraft as addressed in your letter of August 25, 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Your letter represents an unacceptable and unwarranted change from what you stated in a meeting in my office on July 1, 2005. At the conclusion of that meeting it was my clear understanding that the United States Forest Service (USFS) would undertake specific steps to see that Russian air-tankers would be available to use in an emergency, should enough American firefighting assets not be available to respond to an extraordinary challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In your most recent correspondence of August 25, you once again assert that Federal Aviation Administration certification is a prerequisite for any action to be taken by the USFS to ensure Russian firefighting planes could be used if necessary. However, as you expressed to me in our meeting, this is an USFS internal rule, not required by any statute. Such a policy, I believe, and you agreed, can and should be put aside if it could endanger life and property in this extremely volatile fire season.  If another significant fire explodes in addition to the wildfires now raging in Southern California, USFS assets may be stretched dangerously thin. I think that we can agree that bureaucratic procedures and regulatory impediments not required by law should not get in the way of these Russian planes</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Your letter, however, represents a reversal of what I believed was agreed upon in our conversation. That is no small matter. After Hurricane Katrina, the American public will not stand for decisions, in the face of an impending calamity, made with more mind to political turf protection than helping people. Steps must be taken to ensure that all options are available in case we face massive wildfires in the West. If the worst case scenario occurs and all options that could have been available  are not, there will be a severe accounting. In the meantime, I find the USFS's inaction to be deplorable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to your prompt response and, above all, action in response to this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dana Rohrabacher,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, December 8, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. REY: Let me first express my regret about the death of your firefighters, especially Pablo Cerda, in the Esperanza fire. Pablo was one of my constituents, a Fountain Valley High School graduate. His tragic death is one of the primary reasons for this letter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Your June 21, 2006 response to my April 5, 2006 letter was not responsive to the specifics that I requested. Your letter contained the same information that has been relayed to me in the past by your agency. There has been a disconnect between presentation information and the written responses, as indicated in my September 29, 2005 letter to Mr. Bosworth. For example, your second and third paragraphs which mention an initial attack response rate of 98.5 for the 2005 fire season are misleading.  Initial attack rates have nothing to do with the availability of aircraft to support the firefighters on the ground. Initial attack concerns the use of resources nearest to the fire, not the availability and position of the federally funded aircraft to attack the fire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am still concerned that we have neither the correct tools nor the operational plans that are required to reduce the fire risk to California. Your response did not specifically answer my questions regarding the operations, logistics, and communications compatibility plans that must be in place if we are to use foreign assets to support firefighting in the U.S. In addition to my concerns about the availability of the Russian fleet of firefighting aircraft in case of emergency, I now have concerns  about the overall management of our fire tanker fleet. The newest large tanker aircraft that is available, a DC-10 tanker, was created with private financing. This aircraft was not used until the day after the fire crew was overwhelmed in the Esperanza fire when the DC-10 tanker was used for six drops. The request and funding for the operations of this aircraft was done by the state</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The responsibility for airworthiness and safety of aircraft over the United States is the responsibility of the Federal Aviation Administration, not the Forest Service. The FAA has the category of Public Use Aircraft for aircraft used to fight fires, if aircraft wish to be used to save lives and property. For example, the National Guard C-130's are public use aircraft and do not have to pass the additional requirements of the Forest Service. We allowed the IL-76 flights into Little Rock Air Force  Base after Katrina when they brought supplies to our citizens. Not to consider new or foreign aircraft under the excuse of interagency safety and airworthiness standards is a red herring which has cost the country both in funds, in property and in lives destroyed and at risk. Your unwillingness to take the necessary steps to ensure the availability of large aircraft in situations in which the current assets are not sufficient is unconscionable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To summarize, your response was again filled with the bland generalities on this issue and it continues to leave me with no confidence. The failure during the Esperanza fire validates my lack of confidence in your organization and decisions. Since we are at the end of the 2006 fire season, I want to be ensured that we are better prepared for the 2007 fire season than we were for this season. To this end I am talking to Senator Feinstein and others to ensure that this issue is not ignored until  more firefighters lose their lives and property and homes are destroyed. I am also involved in a private evaluation of this issue. Unless I receive satisfactory explanations, there will be a painfully harsh critique of your decision making on this issue. I expect to hear from you in detail before the first of the year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dana Rohrabacher,</paragraph>
