  <chair> Pursuant to the order of the House of Thursday, January 18, 2007, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Millender-McDonald) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers) each will control 15 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="475">H.R. 475</bill>. I will not go into any detailed explanation of it because the Chair of the committee has already given that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But before I begin my remarks on the legislation before us, I want to express my gratitude to all the dedicated young people who come to serve the House as pages. We are blessed to have such a talented group of young people who are willing to leave home and come here to work for us and for the people of this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I still recall the first page that I appointed during my first term in the Congress. She was a wonderful young woman, and she served here well. She then went on to college, then to medical school, and is now in residency and has established an outstanding record. Both here in the Congress as a wonderful page and academically, she has done very well. I am certain she will be a wonderful doctor as well. This is typical of the types of people that we have in this Congress as pages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is certainly no reflection on any problems that they have created, but rather a reflection on problems that Members have created. We believe that pages who serve here should feel nothing but pride for the important role they play in the daily operations of this House and in the legislation that we present. The legislation before us is meant to improve the way that we as adults conduct our oversight of the page program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, the sordid revelations of last fall were not the first time the House had demonstrated a failure to protect the young people who come here to serve in the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In July 1982, following allegations of sexual misconduct involving Members of both parties and their involvement with pages, the Democratic Speaker and the Republican leader of the House appointed a Speaker's commission on pages to study the page program, its usefulness, and to determine what changes needed to be made to better protect America's youth during their  service to the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the commission's recommendations were adopted by the House, including the creation of a leadership-appointed page board responsible for overseeing the page program. That was certainly a step forward, and today's legislation restructures the board that was created then. It has not been the fault of the pages that we had the incident this past year. It is not even the fault of the page board; but, in fact, rather, it was the fault of not engaging the full page board to deal with the problem  that made the problem even worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation before us will improve the board, make it more effective, and enable it to better carry out its important responsibilities. The pages who work here provide tremendous service to Members, staff, and the operations of the House of Representatives. They gain an invaluable experience, a superb education and improved insight into the workings of their own government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We owe it to them to ensure that we are doing everything possible and to ensure that they are able to have a positive, healthy, and beneficial experience. We must ensure that we are taking good care of and protecting the young people who have been entrusted to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation that is before us will help us meet our important obligations. I believe that adding an additional member and making it truly bipartisan with no party dominating will be a truly positive change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that adding a former page to the board will be a positive change. In the past at times we have had Members serving on the board who were serving as pages. They performed that function. But by specifically naming a former page to the board, we can ensure that their input is heard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, having a parent of a former page or, perhaps, even a current page serve on the board will be an asset to us as we consider the operation of the page program, their education and all the regulations pertaining to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope this legislation will help us meet our important obligation in this regard, and I ask all the Members of Congress to support this excellent piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 3 minutes to one of the authors of this important bill, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400216" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="475">H.R. 475</bill>, the House Page Board Revision Act of 2007. Since 1985, I have had the honor of serving on the House page board, either as the chairman or as the Democratic representative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whenever we met as a board, our efforts were to arrive at decisions by consensus. <bill type="h" number="475">H.R. 475</bill> strengthens that spirit of cooperation by providing two basic reforms of the House page board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, we expand the membership of the page board. The current membership includes two Members of the majority party and one Member of the minority party, as well as the Clerk of the House and the House Sergeant at Arms. This bill would expand the page board members by adding three new members to the board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We add a second Member of the minority party to make it an even two Democratic Members and two Republican Members. In a major change, we also add two outside members to the board, one a parent of a current or recent page and the other, a former House page. The Speaker and the minority leader will jointly appoint the page parent and the former page. These additions to the House page board provide for partisan balance and for diversity of views from people who have direct interest in the success  of the page program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second reform in <bill type="h" number="475">H.R. 475</bill> is the requirement that the House page board meet on a regular basis. The Speaker and minority leader will jointly establish the frequency of such meetings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we look forward to operating the page program in an effective manner. We will work together to review and constantly improve the operations of the House page program. It is our goal to assure that the pages will gain every possible benefit from this program while ensuring the well-being of the young people who serve this House as pages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="475">H.R. 475</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to recognize a current member of the page board, the gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Capito).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400061" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by commending my colleague on the page board, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), for his service to the program, long service to the program, and for the bipartisan manner in which he has handled the legislation before him today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank the Chair and ranking member of the House Administration Committee, and I would like to join my fellow, the ranking member and all of us, really, to say thank you to all the pages who are in the room today, all the pages who are currently serving, and all those pages who have done wonderful service in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be the original cosponsor of the House Page Board Revision Act and rise to urge my colleagues to support it. I believe my colleagues will support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House page program has existed for well over a century and provides teenagers with an incredible opportunity to learn about the legislative process, gain leadership and teamwork skills that can be applied to whatever profession they decide to enter. House pages provide a valuable service to the House of Representatives as well. The page program is truly an asset, both to this body and to the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I guarantee, if you ask any page in this room, present or former, about their experience, there is one word that they always use to describe it when I ask, and that is "fantastic." That is why Members of this House were shocked to learn that a former Congressman's inappropriate interaction with House pages came to light last fall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a mother, it was very upsetting to find out that children sent to Washington could possibly be preyed upon. As a Member of this House and a member of the page board, I was disappointed that the information regarding those e-mails was not shared with the full page board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But since it is impossible to go back and fix, it is important that the House move forward to make the changes to prevent such an incident or other incidents that could endanger the safety of young people. Certainly, we all know that one of the most important rules of this House is for Members, of course, to conduct themselves in a manner that reflects credibility of the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it is imperative that we learn lessons from last year's situation and take the steps necessary to better protect House pages and to ensure that any potential problem is investigated fully.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, many of the items in this bill are suggestions that I made to the page board in October, and I will include this letter into the RECORD listing my reasons for supporting this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation balances the partisan make-up of the page board by incorporating two pages from each party. I believe this provision is important, not just symbolically but it is also important because it demonstrates that nothing within the page board is ever construed as partisan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that everyone involved, House Members, staff, employees, pages, dorm supervisors alike feel comfortable approaching the page board with any information about possible threats to the safety of the children in this program. Demonstrating that the board is truly bipartisan should make this easier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Expanding membership to include a former page and the parent of a current or recent page will improve discussions on policies for the page program and provide that additional perspective, that additional set of eyes and ears for any problems that may arise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly, regular meetings, I heartily agree, of the page board, will help shed light on any trouble facing our pages, and I am pleased that this provision has been included in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hope is that other recommendations that have been put forward, such as a peer counseling program, better communications, will strengthen this program as we move forward into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the leaders of both parties for agreeing to take action to better protect the pages who serve this House; and, again, I thank Mr. Kildee for offering this bill. This is a good bipartisan piece of legislation, and I ask my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>October 5, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR PAGE BOARD MEMBER: This week has been difficult for all Members of Congress, as well as for the institution in which we serve. Make no mistake, the revelation of Mark Foley's despicable actions have been difficult on the young people in our Page Program as well. I am confident that I speak for the entire Page Board in expressing outrage and hoping that anyone involved in this tragic sequence of events be severely punished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Speaker Hastert called for the Page Program to be reviewed and strengthened. As the Speaker correctly stated, times have changed since this great program was created, and I believe it is incumbent upon us to ensure we address these changes as they pertain to the Page Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a fellow member of the Page Board, I write to you today for two reasons: (1) To offer my full support for the continuation of the Page Program, and (2) Offer my suggestions on how we can begin to update and strengthen this program to ensure it continues to offer a safe learning experience for our nation's young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we move forward, I ask that we consider using the following items as a starting point for reform to the Page Program:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(1) Increase the number of Members of Congress on the Page Board and, like the Committee on Standards &amp; Official Conduct, establish equal representation from both parties on the Page Board. I know we all agree that the issue of safety for the young people in the Page Program is not a partisan one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) Developing a peer counseling program within the Page Program. Modeled after peer programs that have been successful in our educational system, this would provide pages with an additional outlet to express any problems or concerns that may be easier than reporting to an adult.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(3) The implementation of monthly meetings with the Page Board, pages, as well as a representative from the U.S. Capitol Police. We should create a system in which all members of the Page Board have more information on any potential problem facing the pages, including receiving reports from the Capitol Police on any possible problems with crime activity on Capitol Hill or in the page dorm neighborhood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(4) Establish training and guidelines on educating Members of Congress and pages on the job description and responsibilities of those in the Page Program as well as proper relationships with pages, Members of Congress, or any employee of the House of the Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with you to achieve our shared goal of improving this great program, and more importantly, ensuring we have put in place the best procedures to protect the safety and welfare of the young people in the Page Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, now I would like to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Holt), a former page.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair for her time and for presenting this legislation. I also commend the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers), the gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Capito), and the others who have been involved in this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is important because of the tradition and because of the future. I know some people have said why does Congress even maintain the page program. We could privatize it. We could have messengers. Why does Congress even maintain a dormitory?</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Because we contribute to the growth and the education of future leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I speak as a former page, many decades past now, but I must count that as one of the formative experiences of my life. The pages learn the discipline of employment, they learn teamwork, but they also take to heart the democratic process, the representative government. They literally walk in the footsteps of some of the great figures of history. But we have a responsibility as Members of Congress not just for their education and growth, but also for their safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is important. I am pleased that the legislation mandates that the Page Board be composed of equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats, that it include a former page and a page parent, and mandates regular meetings of the board, so that the board is constantly aware and makes us in this body constantly aware of our responsibility for the welfare and the growth and the safety and the education of the pages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The country is better off because of these pages, many of whom have gone on to important leadership positions and contributed in so many ways, in their hometowns, in their home States, and, in many cases, in the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former page and as a parent, I was offended and shocked at the breach of trust that occurred in the past year. But I am pleased that we are acting today to address systemic shortcomings and to prevent any such occurrence in the future, and, more to the point, working to make this a truly positive experience for all pages, all these young men and women, future leaders, and important employees and public servants even now.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to just make a few closing comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am just delighted with this piece of legislation. I congratulate Mr. Kildee, my esteemed colleague from the State of Michigan, and also Mrs. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO, who spoke earlier. It is a good piece of legislation. It is, unfortunately, needed. But it should have been in place before. It might have helped to prevent some of the events we had this past year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I strongly support this legislation. I urge all of our colleagues to vote for it. May we all have a better Page Board and a better Page Program and continue one of the most outstanding programs that a young person in this Nation can participate in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the ranking member on the Committee on House Administration for his stewardship and his leadership in the Page Program. I would like to thank all of those who were responsible for this great legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this House must pass this bill. The Page Program is a treasured institution that offers youngsters from across this country the opportunity to serve and to learn firsthand about the Congress, while helping us to conduct the Nation's business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said this morning to the pages when I was coming in, this is your bill. Of all the bills you have heard throughout the years you have been here, this one is yours, and we are happy to introduce this bill today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recent unfortunate events have shown that the governance of the Page Program needs reform. The House minority must be brought into the process as full partners with equal representation, eliminating any hint of partisanship. This is why I applaud the Speaker of this House. She wants to make sure, as much as we can, to have nonpartisanship in conducting the business of the People's House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This board will benefit from new representation of parents and former pages themselves, and that is an added incentive, Mr. Speaker, because when you have parents and when you have former pages, they can have input that will benefit these pages who are here with us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These and other reforms proposed by the gentleman from Michigan and the gentlewoman from West Virginia, who have served diligently on the Page Board, will greatly improve the program. I think also the increase in meetings will be an additive as well, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am proud for all of those who have been part and parcel of this legislation, as well as I am proud of our new Speaker, who has made these reforms part of the agenda for the first days of the new Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all Members now to support this legislation and to protect these young folks who come from all areas of this country, coming here to do a part and to serve us as we do the people's business.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="475">H.R. 475</bill>, the House Page Board Revision Act of 2007. I thank my colleagues, Mr. KILDEE, the gentleman from Michigan, and Mrs. CAPITO, the gentlewoman from West Virginia, for their good work in crafting this bipartisan legislation, which will do much to ensure the safety of the pages that serve the United States Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In view of recent events, parents everywhere are right to be concerned for the safety of their children--after all, if children are not safe in the Capitol, the seat of the National Government, can they be safe anywhere? It is  important that we pass this legislation today to reassure the public that the Capitol is safe for children, including pages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The scandal that erupted on September 29, 2007, involving former Representative Mark Foley's predatory conduct toward House pages, and coverup by the senior House Republican leadership, has led some to call for the termination of the Page Program. In my view, that would have been a terrible mistake and a terrible commentary upon the ability of the House of Representatives to ensure the safety of the children entrusted to its care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Page Program needs to be mended not ended. The teenagers who serve as congressional pages are outstanding young men and women, invariably chosen because of their high achievement and outstanding service to their community. Service as a page is often a stepping stone to greater public service and nearly always a window into history. The program's alumni include Representative TOM DAVIS, Representative DAN BOREN, Senator CHRISTOPHER DODD, and Microsoft founder  Bill Gates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of eliminating the page program, we need to get rid of sexual predators in office. An important part of the new Democratic majority's agenda is end the culture of corruption that pervaded the previous Congress and to make the 110th Congress the most ethical Congress in history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The page program is a good thing; the kids that are in it are good kids. Right now, security for pages in Washington includes curfews, a buddy system when they leave their dormitory, 24-hour security at the residence hall, sign-outs when the pages leave, parental notification for many extracurricular activities, and a pre-program orientation laying out acceptable and unacceptable behavior for pages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as the Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I am proud to support this legislation today. I support <bill type="h" number="475">H.R. 475</bill> because it will ensure more oversight of the Page Program in Congress, thus reducing substantially the risk of exposing pages to harmful persons or conduct. We must show America that we are striving to keep America's children safe, starting here on Capitol Hill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
