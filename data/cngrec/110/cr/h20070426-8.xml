  <speaking speaker="412210" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Small Business Lending Improvements Act of 2007, passed yesterday by this House by an overwhelming margin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Small businesses are critical to the Kansas and American economies. They create jobs, they keep wealth in our local communities, and they spur innovation. But in order to succeed, small businesses need ready access to startup capital and financial services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Small Business Association's 7(a) loans have helped tremendously. Last year alone, 757 Kansas businesses received $104 million through the 7(a) program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Small Business Lending Improvements Act will increase the accessibility of small business loans, helping to drive the Kansas economy forward. I especially support its provisions benefiting the rural lenders that serve so many entrepreneurs in my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was pleased to vote for this important and innovative bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
