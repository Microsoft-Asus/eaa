    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as most everybody in America knows, this is March Madness, and March Madness is a wonderful experience when people cheer for their basketball teams and watch great athletes compete for the national championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the teams competing in San Antonio for the national championship will be the University of Memphis Tigers, my home university and my alma mater. We are extremely proud of the University of Memphis. And in Tennessee, it was 173 years ago that a great group of Tennesseeans, including my predecessor from the Western District of Tennessee, Davy Crockett, went to the Alamo. This time, Mr. Speaker, it's going to be a different story. Tennesseeans will win, have a victory in San Antonio, and  your Congressman who is in the House will come back to the House.</paragraph>
