    <paragraph>Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I have been asked to reiterate that votes are expected tomorrow and could occur around noon, with other votes occurring in the afternoon. A number of amendments are still pending, and it is hoped that we can begin to dispose of them as other Members come forward with amendments.</paragraph>
