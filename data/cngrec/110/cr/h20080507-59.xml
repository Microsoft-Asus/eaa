    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would like to first thank Chairman Frank and all of the members of the Financial Services Committee, and particularly those members who serve on the subcommittee that I chair, the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity. I'm thanking Members on both sides of the aisle for helping to bring this bill to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act, authorizes a $15 billion HUD administrative grant and loan program to State and local governments to purchase, rehabilitate and resell or rent foreclosed homes. To understand the urgent need to enact this legislation, one need only consider the sobering figures on foreclosures recently released by RealtyTrac, which show that foreclosure filings during the first quarter of 2008 are 112 percent higher than 1 year ago, and that actual bank repossessions  of homes during March were a shocking 129 percent above March 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The human reality behind these numbers is revealed if you visit, as I have the past year, cities and communities in cities like Cleveland, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; or the San Bernardino and Stockton metropolitan areas in California, where block after block is dotted by foreclosed properties, many of them suffering from neglect or actual vandalism. These abandoned and foreclosed properties drag down the value of homes still occupied by working families, and contribute to a cascade effect whereby  plummeting home prices erode the tax base of State and local governments and cause real estate related industries such as the construction trades to suffer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>States and most local governments must balance their budgets each year and, as a result, 20 States have already had to make or are proposing budget cuts due largely to revenue losses resulting from the subprime crisis, which further reduces demand in the economy and deepens the recession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 10, the Financial Services Committee heard from Mayor Thomas Menino of Boston, Governor Martin O'Malley of Maryland, and others, that despite severe physical constraints, many States and cities are already dedicating their own shrinking tax revenues to purchase foreclosed properties and attempt to stabilize these neighborhoods. But they are overwhelmed by the scale of the problem in comparison to their shrinking tax revenues. For this reason, the National Governors Association has stated  that a "one-time Federal funding commitment to support the acquisition and rehabilitation for foreclosed properties is vital."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Governors are joined in their support for the stimulus contained in <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill> by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, National Association of Counties, National Association of Local Housing Finance Agencies, and the National Council of State Housing Finance Agencies. <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill> is also endorsed by nearly 40 civil rights, community development, labor and low income housing groups, including the AFL-CIO, Catholic Charities, Lutheran Services of America, the NAACP, the National Urban League, the National  Low Income Housing Coalition, and the National Foreclosure Prevention and Neighborhood Stabilization Task Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill targets assistance where it is most needed. The $7.5 billion in grants and $7.5 billion in loans would be allocated to States based on two factors: The number of foreclosures, and the number of subprime loans 90 days delinquent. This is then subject to a limited adjustment for median home prices, a bipartisan compromise that was worked out in mark-up with the committee's members from Ohio, which, like many midwestern States, has faced skyrocketing foreclosures but did not experience  an extraordinary run up in housing prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the bill puts flexible resources in the hands of government with the capacity to address the crisis and put funds on the street quickly enough to stimulate the economy. Rather than expect HUD to process plans from 1,200 entitlement jurisdictions, the balance we struck at mark-up was to allocate funding to States and to the Nation's largest 100 cities, largest 50 counties, and cities over 50,000 with especially high foreclosure rates. The areas of States outside of those cities and counties  would be addressed in the State's plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the bill's timelines, fund obligation must begin within 6 months of enactment, be completed within a year, and fully spent within 2 years of enactment. This is no "big government," immortal program, as our colleagues across the aisle suggest. Rather, it is a timely, targeted and temporary shot in the economy's arm, exactly where one is needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, using well-accepted construction activity multipliers, the National Foreclosure Prevention and Neighborhood Stabilization Task Force calculates that the bill's proposed $15 billion investment will generate at least $38 billion in direct and ripple effect economic activity nationwide, employ about 120,000 people, and restore nearly $225 million per year in local real estate tax collections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some Republicans have tried to frame this bill as a bailout bill for investors. This simply is not so. Government and their nonprofit partners will drive a hard bargain with property owners because they are highly incentivized to make this money go as far as possible in their efforts to stabilize neighborhoods where many of them have been working for years, and because they must pay the government back any funds used to purchase homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In no event, moreover, can they pay more than 110 percent of the average  home sale price in the area. Creaming of properties and "sweetheart" deals are prevented by the requirement that properties sit for 60 days before they are eligible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What <bill type="h" number="5815">H.R. 5815</bill> does make possible is for States, cities and counties to stabilize a few neighborhoods, especially low income ones, that are in serious danger of an overcorrection and rapid deterioration past the tipping point, where it becomes very difficult to turn them around.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge Members to hear the pleas of the Nation's governors, mayors, community-based organizations and ordinary citizens to provide this critical relief to stabilize neighborhoods and stimulate the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration and my friends on the opposite side of the aisle in this Chamber argue that we cannot afford to respond. I would like to just remind this body of what Mr. Frank said earlier today, we afforded $30 billion to bail out Bear Stearns, and certainly we can afford half of that amount, $15 billion for the entire country. We simply cannot afford not to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge passage of the Neighborhood Stabilization Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400061" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, today I want to thank, first of all, the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Housing, of which I'm the ranking member, for her good hard work and dedicated service. We've had a lot of hearings and a lot of information, and I think we all want to try to achieve help for the homeowners or those who are on the edge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But today I rise in opposition to <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008. We all recognize that we are experiencing a sharp increase in foreclosure statistics and starts. Over the past year alone, approximately 550,000 homeowners with subprime loans began the foreclosure process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, we shouldn't rush to act. We must guard against adopting policies which create moral hazards and unintended consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, we believe <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008, is a bill which does both. <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill> is an unnecessary government intervention in the housing market which will bail out real estate speculators, servicers, and lenders while doing nothing to assist hardworking Americans struggling to make their mortgage payments. This bill will not keep one person in their mortgage or in their home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill does this through a $15 billion authorization for grants and loans to be used to purchase already foreclosed homes from lenders, servicers, and speculators who have made bad loans or unwise investments. The Neighborhood Stablization Act will allow investors and servicers to unload their foreclosed properties to the government with the taxpayer footing the bill. Servicers and investors might even be encouraged to pursue foreclosure if this bill is enacted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of incentivizing foreclosure, Congress should be encouraging services to engage in voluntary loan work-outs and modifications. Furthermore, this bill calls on States and local governments to convert foreclosed properties into affordable rental and single-family housing. The increase in housing supply and decrease in prices creates housing affordability without government intervention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm also concerned that the overly broad income targeting provisions in this bill, which will allow families making 100 percent and 140 percent of area median income respectively, to rent and purchase properties acquired with funds from this act. It is not appropriate for the government to provide housing assistance to individuals who can afford market-rate housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress should focus its efforts on keeping hardworking Americans in their homes. We should not unnecessarily intervene in the housing market in the process of adjustment after years of what has proved to be unsustainable growth. It is imperative that we recognize the primary beneficiaries of this bill will not be the thousands of Americans struggling to hold on to their home, but the lenders, servicers and speculators who bear much of the responsibility for the current housing slump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Putting aside the issue of how massive this new program would be, the bill's ultimate beneficiaries, as I said, could be our lenders and investors and speculators; and indeed the FHA commissioner, Brian Montgomery, stated in testimony before our committee that "this legislation may have the unintended consequences of making foreclosure a more attractive option for lenders thereby compounding the very problem of rising foreclosures that the bill purports to address."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I oppose this bill, and I would like to reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield to the chairman of the Financial Services Committee 3 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>A former President once unfairly characterized a leader of this House as someone who couldn't walk and chew gum at the same time. The gentlewoman from West Virginia extends, frankly, that insult to the whole House. She suggests we can't do two bills in one night. She says we should work to try to help avoid foreclosure. I agree. That's the next bill which we will get to after all of this useless temper tantrum is over, we will get to it at 3 o'clock in the morning,  but we will get to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That bill will help avoid foreclosure. I know the gentlewoman agrees. She voted for that bill in committee although a majority of her colleagues were against it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I do not understand how anybody could argue that doing this bill now interferes with that bill later. They are totally not in conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the notion that this bill doesn't keep people out of foreclosure is true. It doesn't combat global warming. It doesn't get troops out of Iraq. It won't help me lose weight. There are a lot of things this bill won't do that I very much want to do. None of them are a reason to vote against a bill that doesn't do what it doesn't say it's going to do but does what it does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What it does is to go to the aid of cities that have been victimized by the deregulation run rampant, perpetrated by this administration, which has led to the subprime crisis. We have vacant property everywhere in these areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the argument that this is going to award speculators and be an incentive to do foreclosures is also flatly wrong. This is $15 billion. People will tell you it's a lot of money, and it is. Do you know how much money this is? This is half of the money that this administration made available to buy up the debts of Bear Stearns. Now, I think they had to do that. I think they were forced to do it. But I think we have to do this as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do think that the whole country, under this administration's calculation, ought to get at least half of what Bear Stearns got. That's all that this does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, unfortunately, it's not nearly enough to buy up the property that's foreclosed. So anyone who says, I'm going to foreclose today because I want to get in on this, would be nuts because there is already property ahead of them. And even when this bill becomes law, if it does, there's a 60-day wait, and I hope it will be part of the stimulus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Property that was once paying taxes because of this subprime crisis now eats taxes. It bites neighborhoods. And, yes, some of the people who foreclose may benefit here. But we are telling the cities and the States to be careful with this money. They have to buy it for affordable housing. That will put limits on what they will pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And you can say, well, why don't the cities do it on their own? Because the very cities that need help here have lost revenue because of this foreclosure. These properties are fire traps; they attract people who break the law; they attract sanitary nuisances. They lead to water hazards.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield an additional minute to the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I always feel good when people make arguments against legislation that won't really deal with the legislation. The notion that the problem with this bill is that it doesn't help avoid foreclosure, when it was not the bill intended to avoid foreclosure, shows well, there's a dearth of arguments against it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The argument that it's going to reward the speculators, this will go to  cities dealing with property that is causing them problems. Do we not trust the cities and States of this country to take this money and use it judiciously and wisely to prevent neighborhood decay?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't understand the animus that motivates so many of my Republican colleagues that say, Oh, no, let's not have government intervention here. Well, we heard that a while ago, and people on the other side successfully blocked government intervention in regulating subprime mortgage origination outside of the banks. It was this religion of never intervening that brought us here. A limited intervention to undo the negative consequences is what this bill calls for.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400061" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I would like to make a comment in reference to the chairman's comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I live in a small community, just barely over 50,000. And we have local government and State programs in effect right now that deal with foreclosed or blighted projects. They work together with the local nonprofits, with the local land owners and realtors, and we have problems that are moving forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So to say that we're not in favor of programs that would deal with foreclosure-blighted neighborhoods I think is factually incorrect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like now to yield some time to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Feeney), a member of the Financial Services Committee, 3 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400131" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say this bill tonight proves at least two maxims about Congress: One is that we have two speeds: zero and that we overreact; and the other is that the law of unintended consequences means that often the adverse or the harmful consequences of the things we do in Congress are much more meaningful than the positive things that we would like to accomplish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me give one example. Back in the early sixties and seventies and eighties, and all the way through the nineties, Madam Chairman, there were lots of complaints that low- and middle-income people, especially minorities, didn't have access to loans, that they didn't get the same opportunity that other people of above-modest means had to own a home in America. And there were complaints, and there were all sorts of animosity, to use the Chairman's word from a few minutes ago, towards lenders for  being discriminatory against low- and middle-income people again, especially minorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the Community Redevelopment Act was enacted in 1977, and at that time one of the things that Congress had the power to do was to oversee and look at every single lender in America in order to determine that they were aggressively making loans in low and poor and minority neighborhoods so that we could measure those institutions so we could insist that there be more access to homeownership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We got exactly what we asked for, and part of that was the subprime loan crisis. And part of that was zero-document loans where people could literally line up without any proof of income. Part of that was instead of making it a 70-percent loan or 75-percent loan, which almost never fails, making 100-percent, or 110-percent loans. Part of that was teaser interest rates to get people into a home at 3 percent, which they could afford to make an $800 or $900 a month payment, and when that teaser  rate readjusted to 7 or 8 or 9 percent, all of a sudden what used to be an $800 payment became a $2,000-a-month payment, and they couldn't make it. They got exactly what we anticipated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Countrywide is now bankrupt. Countrywide in 2005 got the Best in Minority Lending Award from the Lending Industry Diversity Conference. This Congress had great intentions. We wanted to make more money available so that everybody could have the American Dream. In fact, as of 2 years ago, America had an all-time high, approaching 69 percent of Americans that owned their own homes. That's great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth of the matter is because of easy money from the Feds, because of investor imprudence, because of greedy Wall Street speculators, we have now got a crisis because of a bubble that is collapsing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who is being bailed out by this bill? The $15 billion will eventually end up, after it goes to the cities and counties, in the pockets of the investors and holders of these mortgages that went seeking higher profits that put people in homes that they couldn't afford. We are doing exactly what economists want us not to do: creating a moral hazard. It is going to make it more likely, rather than less, that foolish loans are made in the future.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I recognize for 1 minute the gentleman from Massachusetts to straighten out the gentleman on the opposite side of the aisle who does not know the history of CRA.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Of all of the unfair accusations, the one that blames the Community Reinvestment Act for this is the strongest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Community Reinvestment Act was passed in 1977. This subprime crisis, of course, did not appear until nearly 30 years later; but more important, the subprime loans that caused problems were overwhelmingly made by institutions not covered by the Community Reinvestment Act. It covers depository institutions: banks and thrifts and credit unions. Credit unions aren't covered. Banks and thrifts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If only those institutions, deposit-taking, regulated institutions covered by CRA had made these loans, we wouldn't have had the crisis. The loans were made by institutions not covered by CRA 30 years, 28 years after CRA was passed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I didn't say what the chairman said I said.

I think the chairman will agree with me.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I will take back my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, I thought I heard the gentleman talk about the Community Reinvestment Act. It's been late. I keep hearing, "I move to adjourn." Maybe my ears got a little curdled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought the gentleman said, and we'll check the record later. If he didn't mention the Community Reinvestment Act, I will apologize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But no. I for one have been saying that we should not be pushing people into homeownership when they can't handle it, and part of the problem here was killing affordable rental housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let's have the record clear. There is no rational way to blame the Community Reinvestment Act passed in 1977 and not cover the nondepository institutions for this crisis caused by the nondepository institutions.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Madam Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to say this. I have to apologize to the gentleman, too, because for a moment, I thought I heard a disjointed syllogism because I couldn't make that connection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is needed by this country. This bill is going to help neighborhoods maintain their integrity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I have to ask one question: Where was the moral hazards argument when Penn Central got $7 billion? When Lockheed Martin was bailed out? When Franklin National Bank was bailed out? When Chrysler was bailed out? Continental Illinois? When Bear Stearns received its $29 billion plus a $13 billion loan? Where was the moral hazards argument?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems that this argument surfaces whenever poor people or whenever people who are living in the streets of life, whenever people who have not found their way into the well-off, the well-heeled, and the well-to-do, it seems that it tends to surface. I think that it's time for us to do for others what we can do for these major corporations.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you very much, Madam Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an extraordinarily important measure. If we don't learn from history, we're doomed to repeat it. Around 1929, we had another crisis that happened as a result of one of our financial legs coming out from under us. At that time, there was a Republican administration that fostered so much of that. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in a Democratic administration, had to come and realize that government had to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're not doing this because we don't have anything else to do. We're doing this because we have an economic crisis of soaring magnitude before us. The derivatives of this magnitude are affecting communities and neighborhoods where these foreclosures are leaving these empty homes, many of them in $200,000, $300,000, $400,000 neighborhoods. They're taking down the residential value of communities around them, and these communities in these cities and towns are already strapped with their own financial  pressures, much like my own city of Atlanta, and they need help in rescuing these communities. We're coming to their rescue.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412202" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for yielding and for the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the underlying issues as it relates to this bill is I think the way in which it was contemplated. I'm not making a process argument, but what I am making is an argument that suggests there's a very serious oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the oversight was the committee's rejection of the McHenry amendment. The McHenry amendment basically said, look, if you're going to have these grants and loans and there's going to be properties that are going to be purchased, there should be an open process, there should be a bidding process, and it should be something that everybody has access to. And I think the failure of the majority in this case was to dismiss that and put it aside.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've heard cities tonight described as victims. The chairman a minute ago said he has great confidence, and I'm paraphrasing, but great confidence that cities are going to use the money judiciously and wisely. Well, my congressional district falls in the shadow of a city with a different reputation that doesn't have a judicious and wise reputation always. Let me read you just a couple of headlines within the past couple of weeks about some of the schemes that have happened from a corruption point  of view about the very people that you're contemplating entrusting $15 billion to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here's one this month: "Witness Details Pay-To-Play Schemes" or "Ex-Illinois Official Pleads Guilty to Lying" or "Corruption Firmly Entrenched in State" or "Illinois: Corruption on Parade" or "Top Aide to Illinois Governor Is Indicted in Kickback Inquiry."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have got deep troubles in northern Illinois, and what is conspicuously absent in this bill, and I've read it, I've looked at it all, within this bill there is no requirement of any kind of disclosure, no requirement of any kind of notice, no requirement of anything whatsoever. So, in other words, if you're a corrupt official working for an agency that has been entrusted with this $15 billion, there's absolutely nothing, nothing that prohibits you from selling this to a friend for whatever  you want to sell it for. The bill is absolutely silent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, is the majority trying to be complicit in a nefarious scheme? Of course not. But was it a gross oversight on the part of the majority in the committee to reject the McHenry amendment? I think so, and I think for that fundamental flaw alone, notwithstanding all the underlying policy questions, that fundamental flaw alone brings a great deal of skepticism to voters in my congressional district. And for that reason, I urge a "no" vote.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from Illinois evidently has not read the bill. As a matter of fact, they have to have a plan that is adopted or accepted, reviewed by HUD. And so in the plan, all of the disclosure, everything that needs to be known about that city's plans will be reviewed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to that, the amendment that the gentleman is referring to is an amendment that would bog down this ability to get money into the neighborhoods and on the street very quickly for the economic stimulus that we anticipate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act. I want to thank Chairman Frank and Chairwoman Waters for their persistent efforts to address the issue of how foreclosures and subprime lending contribute to the vacant and abandoned housing problem in cities like Buffalo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Buffalo and western New York are facing a vacant and abandoned housing crisis that gets progressively worse every day as more and more homes fall into foreclosure. While the City of Buffalo has been dealing with the negative effects of home foreclosures for some time, recent events have made their situation worse, necessitating this relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vacant homes wreak havoc on the neighborhoods in which they exist. These homes often serve as a haven for crime, endangering children and making entire neighborhoods dangerous. They also serve as a drain on local governments, which must deal with decaying homes long after owners and banks have abandoned them. Perhaps most distressing, abandoned homes discourage investment and influence urban flight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill> would provide immediate relief to these neighborhoods in several ways. It would empower local officials to take control of vacant and abandoned properties and increase homeownership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Local governments could use loan funds to purchase and rehabilitate vacant homes for sale to working families who otherwise may not be able to afford quality housing. If homes are beyond repair and within neighborhoods prone to vacancy and abandonment, local governments could use grant funds to demolish them. Both the loan and grant initiatives will provide a much needed and immediate injection of resources into these neighborhoods that have been hard hit by the foreclosure crisis, so that these  communities will have a better chance to get back on their feet and move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is highly dismaying to note that the housing market has gotten progressively worse in the last 12 months, creating the need for the stimulus provided in this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412202" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in response to the chairman's question, yeah, no question about it. There's a plan requirement on page 3, section 4 of the bill, but the plan requirement doesn't prohibit the type of conduct that I just described, a plan as it relates to goals for the sale to different groups, accessibility to different groups, but the plan is silent as it relates to this potentially corrupt practice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it's a flaw and I don't think it's a flaw that can't be redeemed. It can be very easily corrected. It doesn't help the underlying policy objections to the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But $15 billion put out there without any requirement whatsoever as it relates to a prohibition against self-dealing, a member of the housing development authority of a particular municipality calling up a cousin and saying, hey, come on by here, we just purchased this foreclosed property for $100,000, I'll sell it to you for $75,000, there's nothing in here. Notwithstanding the plan language, notwithstanding any other declaration of the majority, it is silent, and we can do much, much better.</paragraph>

And the situation that he just described could not happen. As a matter of fact, you have to pay back the money that you get through the loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) 2 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400074" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Let me thank Chairwoman Waters for yielding and also for her leadership on this issue in getting this bill out of committee and to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an original cosponsor of this legislation, I support its speedy passage through the legislative process. This bill is sorely needed to help stabilize neighborhoods in various types of communities that have high incidences of housing foreclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This act establishes a loan and grant program administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to help States purchase and rehabilitate owner-vacated, foreclosed homes with the goal of stabilizing and occupying them as soon as possible, either through resale or rental to qualified families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I raised concerns about the distribution of loans and grants to Chairwoman Waters, and the bill's funds were originally designed for distribution to States with priority for the 25 most populated cities in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My concern was that many of us had districts that had higher density of foreclosures than many of the top 25 cities in population. Additionally, we needed to ascertain that housing was provided for low- and moderate-income families, inclusive of those who had already suffered foreclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My staff and I worked closely with Chairwoman Waters and her committee staff and placed provisions in the bill that address these concerns. My district, the First Congressional District of Missouri, has alarmingly high foreclosure rates and large numbers of low- and moderate-income families. The bill now mandates a priority for addressing this high foreclosure level area and others like it across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to thank Chairwoman Waters for her leadership on this.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I certainly rise in opposition to this bill. I have no doubt that it is certainly good-hearted but it is certainly wrongheaded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a great challenge in our housing markets today, but I come here with some interest and amusement to see how many of my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle bemoaned the Bear Stearns bailout by the Federal Reserve, only to come here and offer a bill that, ultimately, using the States and localities as a conduit, is going to bail out Wall Street. It's going to bail out the investors, the people who own these properties in the first place, the people who made bad debts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish somebody would introduce a bill to bail me out of my bad debts. Perhaps next time I invest in real estate or the stock market or the commodities, somebody will come here and say, if I failed, we will get the taxpayer to come in and bail me out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second of all, it misses the point of what the true challenge is. The true challenge in our housing markets is a shrinking paycheck, and I know as much as our friends on the other side of the aisle wish to come and blame all the economic woes of our Nation on us, the truth is elections have consequences. They've been in charge of the economic policy of this Nation for almost 18 months now. And what have they done in 18 months?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number one, they passed a budget that has the largest single tax increase in American history, largest single tax increase in American history. After 3 years fully phased in, it's going to be a $3,000 average burden on the American family. That shrinking paycheck causes people not to be able to pay their mortgage bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know what's happened to gasoline prices, almost $4 a gallon. Shrinking paycheck. Now supposedly they were going to bring the price of gas down when they were elected. The American people know differently, and it's not just gasoline that's $4 a gallon. Milk. I've got a 6-year-old and a 4-year-old back home in Dallas, Texas. They drink a lot of milk. Milk's expensive. The cereal they like, it's expensive, all happening under their watch. A shrinking paycheck.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How are people supposed to afford their mortgage when they're having to pay historic high gasoline prices, historic high food prices and pay an extra $3,000 in taxes? Madam Chairman, that's the real challenge that America's families are facing now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And here's another problem with this particular piece of legislation that I find. It ignores the greater crisis in America, and that is the spending crisis, the one that is ignored on a daily basis here. Already we notice that when the new Member from Louisiana was sworn in today, we all saw that he had his baby in his arms, and, I don't know, it might have been a 1-year-old or 2-year-old child, but that child already has inherited a debt of almost $200,000 because Congress after Congress keeps  on spending money and sends the burden to future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, you know, what is it? It's $7.5 billion for grants here and $7.5 billion for loans there. Well, Madam Chairman, sooner or later we're talking about real money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We're on the verge of being the first generation in America's history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. And it's not just me that's saying it, it's the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget, the General Accountability Office. And yet again, the Democrat majority ignores that true crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also find it quite interesting that while the Federal Government continues to be awash in the sea of red ink in passing on unfunded obligations to future generations, that almost every State and municipality in the Nation is running a surplus.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>So we're taking money away from a treasury that has none to supplement treasuries that do have some. We have a great challenge in our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And clearly predatory lending took place, I might add, so did predatory borrowing. And so we need to help people, but the way to help them when people are struggling to pay their mortgages is not to raise their taxes and force them to pay the mortgages of their neighbor, particularly a number of neighbors and Wall Street investors who speculated, who might have engaged in fraud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Madam Chairman, back to the States and localities. For example, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts spends $11 million a year on their Office of Tourism. If we're having a great housing crisis, maybe they could cut back a little on the tourism budget and help the people in need for housing.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Again, if this is such a great priority for the States and they're crying out for these loans and grants, why does the State of Massachusetts continue to spend $760,245 for pools and spray pools under the control of the Department of Conservation and Recreation?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michigan, $9.4 million to enhance public boating access and dock facilities. I have no doubt, Madam Chairman, that this is important. But again, if we have a housing crisis, maybe the good people of Michigan could cut back a little on their boating access facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>State of Ohio. They apparently have a wonderful "Discover Ohio" tourism and marketing campaign, $8.2 million. Maybe they could use some of that money to assist the people in their State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How about some of the municipalities? According to the Daily News, Los Angeles spends a half a million dollars, $550,000 to be exact, for calligraphers to decorate proclamations and honors. I'm sure that those proclamations are very handsome, but again, if we're having a housing crisis, maybe people in Los Angeles can cut back on the calligraphy to assist the people in need. And yet the Democrat majority--and the gentlelady from California who perhaps  is  familiar with the calligraphy--has decided instead to take the money away from the Federal Treasury, help raise taxes on hardworking American families while they're trying to fill up their cars to take their children to school, to try to go to work, so that ultimately we're subsidizing Ohio</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is bad legislation. It should be defeated.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota, a member of our committee, both the subcommittee and Financial Services, Mr. Keith Ellison.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412215" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, let me start by thanking Chairman Frank and Chairwoman Waters for bringing this critical and much-needed legislation to the floor. I'm proud to have worked with both of them on this important legislation which represents the most comprehensive response yet in the American mortgage crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The package of housing measures that we will vote on today and that I proudly support will help thousands of families facing foreclosure keep their homes. This bill will ultimately help other families avoid foreclosures in the future and help recovery of communities harmed by empty homes caught in the foreclosure crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation comes before us at an important time in the mortgage foreclosure and housing crisis. The Pew Center has stated that between seven to eight thousand people per day are filing for foreclosure. Hennepin County alone, which is the largest county in the Fifth District of Minnesota that I represent, has experienced a 54 percent increase in foreclosures from the year before. Statewide foreclosures have risen by 39 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation we're considering today establishes a $15 billion HUD-administered loan and grant program for the purpose of rehabilitation of vacant, foreclosed homes with the goal of occupying them as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, let me just say this: The fact of the matter is that for the people who paid every single mortgage payment and were never late even one time, they are suffering because of this mortgage crisis because they live on a block with foreclosed homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill saves money. Can you imagine the cost to a city, in terms of fire, police and public works resources, just to be able to deal with a home that's foreclosed on a block? This is saving money. This is actually improving the quality of life for people all over America. And this amount of money that we will spend on this bill will pay thousand-fold in terms of quality of life for people all over this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I'm proud to be able to associate myself with this bill, proud to be able to say that when the people of America face a serious foreclosure crisis that is affecting not just the victims of foreclosure, but others, we responded.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank my good friend from West Virginia for her leadership on this and for cogently bringing the debate forward and stating why this is the wrong bill at the wrong time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to hear from my friend, though, from Minnesota who said that this was going to save America money. If we keep saving money at this rate, our deficit ought to disappear in short order, $15 billion chunks going out the door. I'm not sure how that math adds up, but I'm certain that it works somewhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend my friend from Illinois for raising the point, as I know that the chairwoman acknowledged, and that is that there was no bidding process. There is really no accountability in this bill. Yes, there are plans that have to be proposed and submitted, but there's no oversight, there is no oversight of this money. Fifteen billion dollars could go to anybody, truly, who was a friend or a crony of any official in a State or a city. And we're going to trust the cities, as the chairman  said, it was important that we trusted the cities. And I believe primarily that that is important that we do trust cities. If we trusted cities so much, though, then why would we not adopt an amendment that I proposed in committee that said that we ought to let the city do with the property what they deemed appropriate? But we haven't</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I heard the chairwoman say that she wouldn't want to add an amendment that would provide for that accountability or that oversight because it might bog down getting the money to the cities. Well, Madam Chairman, I'll tell you what will bog down getting money to the cities, if people were really sincerely interested in that, and that's a veto. And this bill will be vetoed by the President of the United States for appropriate reasons because it is irresponsible and it is not appropriate to spend  the kind of money that we're talking about without any oversight and without any accountability. Remember, $15 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am constantly surprised, truly, by my friends on the other side of the aisle who don't seem to remember where this money comes from. Where does this money come from? It comes from hardworking Americans. And I would suggest, Madam Chairman, as my friend from Texas said, that hardworking Americans have a significant challenge right now in some aspects of their life, trying to make certain that they can afford the increase in gas prices under this majority, for the increasing prices for commodities  under this majority. And so it would be appropriate that we remember that, and that we allow more Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now what is the solution? Well, I would suggest, Madam Chairman, that a couple of programs that are in place right now and are working diligently to make certain that people can stay in their homes, FHA Secure is a program that is administered by the Federal Housing Authority that provides greater flexibility for refinancing homes for hundreds of thousands of Americans. The Hope Now Alliance was a program that was put into place, a private sector cooperative effort that actually makes it so that  struggling homeowners can get the kind of counseling and guidance to assist them to refinance their mortgages. More than 1.4 million Americans, Madam Chairman, have been shown the opportunity to be able to stay in their home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are positive and productive programs that make it so that individuals can stay in their home. They aren't a bailout that is being proposed by the other side. They aren't taking $15 billion of hard-earned taxpayer money and saying, "It's okay. We'll cover it. Don't worry about that. The American people's pocketbook is absolutely endless."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a bad bill, wrong bill, wrong time. I urge my colleagues to vote "no."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thirty-six percent of all the homeowners in Ohio will feel the effects of what's going on in the subprime crisis. The pain isn't limited to just the families losing their homes, but also the neighbors and the neighborhood around.

These are truly scary numbers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill> will help Ohio and America begin to heal. The flexible bill will give loans and grants directly to the States.

    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I come to the floor optimistic inasmuch as I have heard, I think, where maybe five or six Members on the other side of the aisle raised the issue of exactly what transpired with regard to Bear Stearns and that circumstance some 2 months ago. I come optimistic but at the same time somewhat perplexed because, as I say, this did occur with regard to the Federal Reserve some 2 months ago, and immediately thereafter my office contacted the full body of our committee, both Republicans  and Democrats, saying should not our committee be investigating what transpired there? And we extended a hand to the other side to say let's do two things: First, let's contact the Federal Reserve and Secretary Paulson to raise the issues that are now being raised at this belated date by the other side of the aisle. We came through at that time with a list of upwards of nine pertinent questions, questions such as, the SEC states that it monitored Bear Stearns' capital and liquidity positions on a regular</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These were the questions that we were posing that should have been answered several months ago. We extended the opportunity to the other side at that time to join with us in this letter to make this investigation. Oddly enough, at that time no one on the other side of the aisle found a need to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also what is odd with regard to the investigation in this matter, the committee of jurisdiction looking into what the Federal Reserve did would be the Financial Services Committee. Once again, our side of the aisle suggested to the chairman that we should be delving into the issues that the other side is raising tonight, belatedly. We extended the opportunity to send a letter to Chairman Frank, with signatures of most Members on our side of the aisle to the chairman, saying should we  not be looking at these issues, these nine issues that I just referenced before to the Federal Reserve and also Paulson? Should we not be looking into this in Financial Services? Two months ago no one from the other side of the aisle saw it as pertinent. Tonight, as we go into it here and from the rhetoric that comes to the floor, they all say that they are interested in examining what the Federal Reserve is doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why I say I come to the floor optimistic and a little bit happy because now I believe that when I leave the podium tonight, I can go to the other side of the aisle and I will be more than happy to do two things: To make an addendum to our questions to Secretary Paulson and the Federal Reserve and to make an addendum to Chairman Frank to say that in both cases we should be investigating it and that we would ask that Chairman Frank schedule hearings forthwith, immediately,  so that we can go into the matters that you are raising and that I have raised as well to see what authority the Federal Reserve has to conduct these activities.</paragraph>

Also, I will put in the Record a letter dated April 16 to Secretary Paulson from  the Department of Treasury and Chairman Bernanke of the Federal Reserve as well, itemizing the nine particular questions with regard to their authority and activity; and also the letter in response dated April 14 from Chairman Barney Frank with regard to not setting forth a date for any hearing going forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, April 7, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN FRANK: We are writing to respectfully request you hold a hearing of the full Financial Services Committee regarding the recent collapse of the investment bank Bear Stearns and the subsequent actions taken by the Federal Reserve to facilitate Bear Stearns' sale to J.P. Morgan Chase. These steps have had an immediate impact on the financial markets and are also expected to have a long-term effect on our financial regulatory structure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the first time since the Great Depression, the Fed voted to open its discount window to primary dealers. While this authority has been available to the Fed since 1932, the decision to use it at this time has raised questions about whether and when the Fed should intervene to help a particular industry or firm in the name of market stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the Fed approving the financing arrangements of the sale of Bear Stearns to J.P. Morgan Chase as well as guaranteeing $29 billion in securities currently held by Bear Stearns, the Fed has possibly exposed the American taxpayers to unknown amounts of financial loss and established a precedent that could lead to future instances of companies in similar financial trouble expecting the same assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These extraordinary actions have raised a number of complex and multifaceted questions. As members of the committee of jurisdiction over our nation's financial markets and the regulatory bodies that oversee them, we feel it is imperative to have a full and public vetting of this unique situation.

    <paragraph>CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, April 16, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR SECRETARY PAULSON AND CHAIRMAN BERNANKE: We are writing regarding the recent collapse of Bear Stearns and the subsequent actions taken by the Federal Reserve to facilitate Bear Stearns' sale to J.P. Morgan Chase. These steps have had an immediate impact on our nation's financial markets and have the potential to drastically alter the future regulatory structure of our entire financial system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the first time since the Great Depression, the Federal Reserve voted to open the discount window to primary dealers. While it has been suggested that this authority has been available to the Federal Reserve since 1932, the decision to use it at this time has raised questions about whether and when the Federal Reserve should intervene to help a particular industry or firm in the name of market stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the Federal Reserve approving the financing arrangements of the sale of Bear Stearns to J.P. Morgan Chase, as well as guaranteeing $29 billion in securities currently held by Bear Stearns, the Federal Reserve has possibly exposed the American taxpayers to a tremendous amount of financial loss. We have concerns that this will establish a precedent that could lead to future instances of companies in similar financial trouble expecting the same government intervention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know the long-term health of our economy is of the utmost importance to you both. However, these extraordinary actions have raised a number of complex questions. Below, we have included a list of some of the specific questions that we believe highlight areas of significant importance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1. In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on April 3, 2008, it was indicated that the assets the Federal Reserve will accept as collateral for the $29 billion loan are highly-rated, that J.P. Morgan Chase will keep the riskiest and most complex Bear Stearns assets, and that the Federal Reserve set parameters for the quality of assets that it  would or would not accept. What was the minimum threshold for asset quality?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) states that it monitored Bear Stearns' capital and liquidity positions on a regular basis, and that levels of both capital and liquidity appeared adequate going into the week of March 11-17. Given the subsequent rapid deterioration in Bear Stearns' financial condition, does the SEC have the capability and/or authority it needs to assess risk in systemically-important broker/dealers, especially at the holding company level?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>3. Now that primary dealers are granted the privilege of borrowing directly from the Federal Reserve (through the Primary Dealer Credit Facility), should they be subject to the same oversight that commercial banks must undergo to be eligible to borrow at the discount window? What are the possible negative implications of such regulations?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>4. Bear Stearns has been described by some as "too interconnected to fail," as opposed to "too big to fail." How can regulators identify which firms are too interconnected to fail? Also, some administration participants have justified federal involvement with this transaction by suggesting that one interconnected company could unilaterally bring down our country's entire financial markets system. How would that be possible in this instance?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>5. Why wasn't the "loan" made as a traditional discount window loan to J.P. Morgan Chase? If, as stated in President Geithner's testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, the Federal Reserve did not have the authority to acquire an equity interest in J.P. Morgan, Chase or Bear Stearns, what authority allows it to create and finance an LLC to purchase assets?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>6. If the $29 billion is not to be made available to J.P. Morgan Chase until the merger with Bear Stearns is completed, why is the loan necessary at all? Why is J.P. Morgan Chase unwilling to hold assets that have been priced at current market value and are highly rated?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>7. In 1991, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA, P.L. 102-242, 105 Stat. 2236) set a limit on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC) ability to borrow from Treasury at $30 billion. The statute establishes certain standards, including rate of interest standards but leaves other terms to the Secretary of the Treasury and the FDIC. At the pertinent part it reads:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Corporation is authorized to borrow from the Treasury, and the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to loan to the Corporation on such terms as may be fixed by the Corporation and the Secretary, such funds as in the judgment of the Board of Directors of the Corporation are from time to time required for insurance purposes, not exceeding in the aggregate $30,000,000,000 outstanding at anyone time, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. ..... Any such loan  shall be used by the Corporation solely in carrying out its functions with respect to such insurance. ..... (12 U.S.C. &#xA7;1824)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Did this $30 billion limit have any role in the Bear Stearns negotiations? How did that figure emerge?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>8. A separate provision of the FDIC Act added by FDICIA requires the FDIC to resolve failed institutions on the basis of least cost to the insurance fund but permits the suspension of that requirement when following the least cost standard "would have serious adverse effects on economic conditions or financial stability ..... and ..... any action or assistance [beyond what would be the least cost resolution] would avoid or mitigate such adverse effects." [12 U.S.C. &#xA7;1823(c)(4)(G)(i).]  This authority may not be invoked, however, without consultation with the President and the written recommendations from the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Was the President consulted? Were there any written findings by the Federal Reserve or the Department of the Treasury or any documents projecting the potential adverse effects without the intervention and the mitigation that would be effectuated by the intervention?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>9. Is there any known information regarding any potential conflicts of interest of any of the parties involved in this transaction?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We appreciate your service to the country and look forward to working with you closely on these issues as we move forward. Thank you for attention to these concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, April 14, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. GARRETT: I received the letter signed by you and sixteen of your Republican colleagues on the Financial Services Committee expressing your concern that the recent actions by the top financial appointees of the Bush administration in the matter of Bear Stearns have "possibly exposed the American taxpayers to unknown amounts of financial loss and established a precedent that could lead to future instances of companies in similar financial trouble expecting the same assistance."  It does occur to me as I read your letter that I have somewhat more confidence in the judgment exercised by Secretary of the Treasury Paulson and his aides and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and other officials of the Federal Reserve System than you appear to have, but that is no reason for us not to give this the fullest possible airing. So I do agree that we should be thoroughly examining this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where we may disagree is the context in which this happens. That is, I agree with you that we should have a "full and public vetting of this" matter, but I do not think it is necessary that we have the hearing "on the soonest possible date." I say this for two reasons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the Committee, as you know, is now engaged in serious consideration of the appropriate response to the foreclosure crisis that now confronts us. I realize that there are some who believe that we should take no action at all, but I think the recent movement by the Bush administration to expand the reach of the FHA, even though I do not agree with it in all respects--is recognition of the need for some action. I therefore believe that it is important that the Committee continue its efforts  on dealing with the current crisis, in cooperation with our Senate colleagues who as you know in a bipartisan way have also moved forward on legislation, although I do not agree myself with all aspects of it. My intention is to ask that the Committee continue to focus on this for the next several weeks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, I do believe it is important for the Committee to begin an investigation, including hearings, into the Bear Stearns issue, but not in isolation. It is important that we look at what happened with regard to Bear Stearns, not primarily as a matter of hindsight because in fact we cannot undo what was done, but rather from the standpoint of anticipating what the public response should be in similar matters going forward. This includes of course discussing whether or not these specific actions  taken in the Bear Stearns case were the best ones from the public standpoint, but also beginning the very important issue of what we might do in Congress to make it less likely that situation of this sort will recur. You correctly note in your letter that what the Bush Administration did in this case did establish "a precedent that could</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In summary, I agree that the Committee should be looking into this, not from the standpoint of rebuking Chairman Bernanke or Secretary Paulson, but rather as part of a serious consideration of the causes of the current crisis and more importantly, what we can do to make a recurrence of the events that led up to the Bear Stearns response much less likely in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time I again will extend a hand, and I will yield to the other side to identify which Members from the other side of the aisle will be willing to sign onto the letter to Chairman Frank or to Chairman Bernanke, if there is anyone from the other side who is willing to sign onto the letters. If not, I will be waiting and I will be glad to do an addendum.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="QUESTIONS">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I have no further requests for time, and I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400061" topic="QUESTIONS">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, could I inquire of how much time we have remaining.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentlewoman from West Virginia controls 3 1/2  minutes. The gentlewoman from California controls 4 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400061" topic="QUESTIONS">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I am ready to close. I have no additional speakers as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we have heard a stark difference in opinion on this bill. I would like to make a distinction, as we have heard the discussion going back and forth, and I think the good-natured way that the debate has gone forward but also the intent of this bill is unquestionably a good intent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I would like to clarify to those who are listening that this bill is separate and apart from that person who can't sleep at night, that family who stays up at night trying to figure out how to meet the high cost of gas, how to meet the higher cost of food, and how to make their mortgage payment. We've been working with FHA to get people to refinance and to redo their loans so they can stay in their house, and I don't want there to be confusion concerning this bill and the next bill that we  are going to be considering shortly after this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, separate and apart, is not going to help that family who can't figure out in the middle of the night how they are going to stay in their home, how they are going to pay their mortgage. These properties that we're also discussing are already foreclosed-upon properties. They're owned by investors, speculators, and financial institutions. And that's our objection. I don't believe we are in a position, and I don't think any of the speakers on our side believe we're in a position for a  costly bailout for the lenders, servicers, and real estate speculators who have made risky bets on the housing market and who are now going to off-load their properties into a government program. I think that penalizes every single taxpayer, and it really penalizes that person at night who can't figure out how they're going to get up and pay their mortgage the next day, and that's the person we desperately need and we want to help and it's proper that we should help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I believe that <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill> is overly broad. It's a new government program that is going to end up creating a moral hazard, and it's going to end up benefiting not individuals, not people who are having trouble making their mortgage payments, not people who find themselves upside down in their house. It's going to end up benefiting, at the cost of the taxpayers, and I repeat again, lenders, servicers, and real estate speculators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with that, I urge a "no" vote on <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="QUESTIONS">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman and Members, I would like to thank all of the Members who have come to the floor today in support of this legislation because they understand the devastation to neighborhoods all over this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have listened very carefully to the arguments from the opposite side of the aisle, and none of them rise to the merit of being able to oppose this bill because they're substantive arguments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, I have heard Members on the opposite side of the aisle talk about taxes. They have talked about gasoline. They have talked about everything except what we are here to talk about: the fact that there has been a subprime meltdown in this country and many neighborhoods are devastated. We have homes that are being stripped of the copper. We have homes that have been boarded up with vandals inside those homes, oftentimes living inside those homes, with the weeds growing up in many of  these properties, and the value of the homes in the neighborhood where people are attempting to maintain their homes is going down every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had one Member on the opposite side of the aisle talk about how flush these cities are with money. Evidently, he has not looked at what is going on in the cities and States. Many of them are in deficit situations. They're in deficit situations because we're in this recession, this nonperforming economy under the leadership of the President of the United States where the price of food has risen, gasoline prices are up, and the subprime mess is fueling the problems of our economy. And with all  of this that has taken place under this President and this administration, you would think that the Members on the opposite side of the aisle would want to come to the aid of their constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have talked about the $30 billion bailout under the Fed Chairman that was appointed by this President. And I am sure, since we did not get a call in the middle of the night to even discuss with us that the bailout was going to take place, I'm sure that the Fed Chairman called the President that appointed him. And I would give anything--I would place money on the line--to tell you that the President approved of that bailout. And so why not bail out the people who deserve to be helped? People,  many of them who got into loans that were lured into these loans, lured into these mortgages by unscrupulous real estate brokers who  told them to just sign on the dotted line, by unscrupulous folks representing some of the financial institutions who said get into this ARM and when it resets, I will be there to help you refinance it, and, of course, they're not there. These people, many of them have lost these homes through no fault of their own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the neighborhoods are being devastated. We have information here that tells us how much crime will be fostered on the neighborhoods. As a matter of fact, what we have learned is that when there is one foreclosure, it leads to not only vandalism that affects the entire neighborhood, but it also increases the crime. This has all been documented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would think that the representatives who have been sent here by the people who have voted for them would want to be able to go home and say to their constituents, I understand what's going on in the neighborhoods; to say to their mayors and to say to their Governors and to say to their county commissioners, "We are here to help." Yes, we are spending a lot of money on other things. As a matter of fact, many of the Members on the opposite side of the aisle, in a matter of hours, are going  to vote for over $107 billion in supplemental funding to continue the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Many of these Members have voted to give tax increases to the richest 1 percent in America. The least they could do is vote for the citizens and for their cities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This manager's amendment is in the nature of a perfecting amendment that makes a few changes to the bill that I hope will be relatively uncontroversial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, as this bill has moved through the process, we have moved from a program that allocated all of the funds to States to administer to one that, as I described in my opening statement, distributes funds to States, certain metropolitan cities and large urban counties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment simply removes the State as the middle person in allocations to qualifying cities and counties which would instead receive direct allocations from HUD. This will expedite the distribution of funds which is critical in the context of economic stimulus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the amendment brings a definition of operating costs of housing purchased under the program, which is an eligible use under the grant component in line with similar uses in other HUD programs such as the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. This just clarifies what is and is not an eligible expense when an entity is operating a purchase property as rental property or preparing it for resale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, to further address the concerns that this bill somehow provides a bailout to lenders, the amendment caps the purchase price of foreclosed properties at the appraised price or 110 percent of the average local single family home price, whichever is less. This guards against property owners gaming the system to obtain inflated prices under the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I appreciate the chairwoman's amendment, and I do believe that it does go in a direction that is much better for the bill, I still have, as I have voiced in the earlier debate, serious concerns about the bill in terms of the cost and in terms of taxpayers' dollars bailing out investors and lenders. This does not go to individual homeowners. It does not help somebody in foreclosure, an individual family in foreclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so with that, I would urge a "no" vote on the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairwoman, I was hopeful that the ranking member of the subcommittee would offer support for this amendment. I know that there are some differences that she has and others have on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the attempts that we have made to make sure that it is a bill that can operate efficiently, such as identifying those 100 cities, those 100 counties and those 50 cities of a certain size would be the kind of amendment that the ranking member and others would understand makes this a better bill and would formulate ways by which it could efficiently and effectively get that money into the communities that are needed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I offer an amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Clerk will designate the amendment.</chair>
  <chair>The text of the amendment is as follows:</chair>
  <chair>Amendment No. 2 offered by Mrs. Capito:</chair>
  <chair> Page 3, line 16, after the period insert the following: "The program under this Act shall be administered through the Office of Community Planning and Development of the Department of Housing and Urban Development or any successor office responsible for administering the community development block grant program under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.).".  &lt;p&gt;</chair>
  <chair> Pursuant to House Resolution 1174, the gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Capito) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from West Virginia.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400061" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, my amendment is really quite simple. As we have heard myself talking and Members on my side of the aisle talking about the difficulties that we have with the bill, I realize that the odds are with it that it may pass out of this House. With that in mind, I would like to offer this amendment to what I think makes the bill better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would very simply direct the funds to be administered through the Office of Community Planning and Development of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This office already oversees the HOME and CDBG programs which we are very familiar with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the concerns that we had with the bill was creating a whole new bureaucracy within HUD to administer this program if it were to go forward. And that is problematic any time you are creating a new bureaucracy, particularly when you are replicating some of the delivery systems that already exist within HUD. Those delivery systems exist in the Office of Community Planning and Development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with that, I would like to say that rather than the current language which just merely directs the Secretary to implement the program, I would prefer, and my amendment offers to direct those funds to be administered by the existing Office of Community Planning and Development within HUD which deals, as I said, with the CDBG program which we are all very familiar with working in a lot of our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise to claim time in opposition.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="">
    <paragraph>Although I rise to claim time in opposition, I am not opposed to the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the ranking member of the Housing and Community Opportunity Subcommittee has made a sound addition to the bill here. While, as I mentioned in my opening statement, we did not want HUD to get bogged down in processing 1,200 different plans from all the entitlement jurisdictions in the  HOME and CDBG programs, there is no question that the expertise at HUD to administer this bill's loan and rent program lies in the Community Planning and Development  division of the agency. So I urge my colleagues to support Mrs. Capito's amendment to ensure that we don't create an unnecessary new bureaucracy if <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill> is passed into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

There will be a suspension vote, but the minority has indicated that there will not be a vote on that suspension bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412197" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to offer an amendment to <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008. During the past few months, Americans have woken up every morning and encountered headlines in their local newspapers similar to those in my hometown papers. Home sales hit low in February. Late loan payments highest since 1992; and foreclosures skyrocket.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd like to thank Chairwoman Waters and Chairman Frank for their commitment to address the housing market crisis gripping our Nation and of my beloved Florida. With their leadership, the legislation we're going to pass in the coming days brings hope to millions at home who are being hit especially hard, as much of Florida's economy is dependent on home construction and property development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, thousands of Floridians are out of work and unable to pay their mortgage, turning an economic downturn into a crisis for working families and their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Florida homeowners are being hit especially hard because of the staggering cost of property taxes, skyrocketing insurance premiums and increased mortgage payments. This toxic cocktail has forced many home owners to make difficult decisions. Our seniors are being forced to decide between paying their mortgages and purchasing lifesaving medications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Likewise, working families are confronted with the challenges of putting food on the table, supporting their children's education, and paying their mortgage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the eight counties I represent, there are approximately 13,500 homes in pre-foreclosure, meaning that homeowners have missed at least one of their mortgage payments. To give you a better perspective, Madam Chairman, how deep the problem is in my district, there are approximately 245,000 single family homes in the area that I represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>That means about 5 1/2  percent of the homes in my district are in foreclosure. Every foreclosure serves to further drive down the values of every homeowner in the neighborhood. In addition to the personal tragedies faced by families confronting foreclosure or falling home values are States, counties, and towns that are facing another crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Department of Commerce, approximately 200,000 new homes are sitting empty throughout the United States. Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies found that partially completed or vacant developments reduce tax revenue for cities and towns and hurt businesses. Likewise, a report authored by the U.S. Conference of Mayors found that the rising foreclosures and falling property values may cut tax revenues by more than $6.6 billion for the ten States, including my home  State of Florida. This means fewer police, firemen, and teachers. It means fewer parks and after school programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The crisis has already pushed Florida into a recession, and the State already has to deal with a decrease in tax revenue. The State, which just finished its budget, had to make difficult decisions. Nursing homes in the State charged with taking care of our seniors will face a $163.7 million reduction in what they're paid to take care of residents on Medicaid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislature voted to increase taxes by imposing $200 million in user fees on our State citizens. Likewise, spending on education in Florida will drop by $131 per student. These cuts come at a time when it is more important than ever to invest in our children who will have to compete in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill> will establish a $15 billion HUD administered grant program for the purchase and rehabilitation of owner-vacated foreclosed homes with the goal of stabilizing and occupying them as soon as possible. By doing so, we will ensure that the value of the properties and those surrounding them will not continue to free fall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, my amendment today is very straightforward. It clarifies that nothing in the underlying bill before us today restricts anyone's right to bear arms under the second amendment. This language ensures that those States, localities, and organizations receiving loans and grants under this law cannot, let me repeat, cannot place any restrictions on the properties they purchase or maintain that would infringe upon a person's second amendment rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, throughout this debate, the Bear  Stearns matter has been invoked by Members of the majority who have called forth the bailout of the Bear Stearns counterparties, not of Bear Stearns but of the counterparties, as a reason to bail out lenders in this case. And basically, what they said time and time again, my colleagues, many of them my friends in the majority, they have said, You Republicans had no problem when the Federal  Reserve bailed out Bear Stearns. Now, although you had no problem with that $30 billion, you've got a big problem with the $15 billion under the gentlewoman, the chairman of the subcommittee from California. You have got a big problem with this $15 billion. In fact, that's not the case. I would like to clarify what I think is a misconception.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Immediately following the Bear Stearns, whether you call it a bailout or intervention, it was a $30 billion potential loss to the American taxpayers, I agree with the gentlelady from California. One of our Members, and I think it shows the importance that one Member can make a difference, and that Member was Representative Scott Garrett from New Jersey. Representative Garrett immediately penned a letter to Chairman Frank, and I commend Chairman Frank; he gave  a very prompt response to that letter. But in that letter, Scott Garrett raised some questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the questions was, Should we use taxpayers' money or expose taxpayers to laws to intervene in these situations. He wrote a very carefully crafted letter. He said, I have serious concerns about this, serious concerns about the taxpayer standing behind a $29 billion guarantee. I think these are extraordinary actions that we're taking, and we ought to have a full investigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, that letter was signed by 17 Members of this body. Now, who were those Members? Were they the Democratic Members who are expressing concerns tonight? Let's see.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was Scott Garrett; there was Spencer Bachus, yours truly; there was Don Manzullo from Illinois, I believe he is a Republican; Walter Jones from North Carolina. I congratulate Walter on his fine victory last night. Michele Bachmann, she is a Minnesota Republican; Ginny Brown-Waite, she's from Florida, she's a Republican; Randy Neugebauer, vice chairman of our side, or vice ranking member; Tom Feeney, last time  I checked he was a Republican unless he switched parties. Tom Price. Is there any debate among any of us that he's a very conservative Republican? Ron Paul. Now there's a debate. There's a debate. He may not be a Republican; he may be a Libertarian; certainly not a Democrat. Mr. Putnam, member of the Republican leadership. Thad McCotter. He signed</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seventeen Members, all Republicans, who express real concerns. And I do want to congratulate the chairman of the full committee, because he almost responded yes, we need to look into this; we need to have hearings. He did say, I don't think it's necessary to do it at this time. I think we can postpone it because we need to talk about something that's quite different, and that's the foreclosure prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But tonight on this floor, the Democrats have linked the two as bailouts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell you what the chairman said. The chairman of the full committee, and I agree with him, I think he's absolutely right. He said we should check into this matter because when you use taxpayer money to guarantee something, here is what he said, "It sets a precedent that could lead to future instances of companies ..... expecting the same assistance." A precedent that could lead to future instances of companies expecting the same assistance. And we shouldn't obligate the taxpayers to  make those sort of expenditures because people will begin to think that they will be bailed out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Absolutely what we face tonight. Madam Chairman, Members of this body, we are creating an expectation tonight on this floor by bailing out irresponsible speculators and lenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, April 7, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN FRANK: We are writing to respectfully request you hold a hearing of the full Financial Services Committee regarding the recent collapse of the investment bank Bear Stearns and the subsequent actions taken by the Federal Reserve to facilitate Bear Stearns' sale to J.P. Morgan Chase. These steps have had an immediate impact on the financial markets and are also expected to have a long-term effect on our financial regulatory structure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the first time since the Great Depression, the Fed voted to open its discount window to primary dealers. While this authority has been available to the Fed since 1932, the decision to use it at this time has raised questions about whether and when the Fed should intervene to help a particular industry or firm in the name of market stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the Fed approving the financing arrangements of the sale of Bear Stearns to J.P. Morgan Chase as well as guaranteeing $29 billion in securities currently held by Bear Stearns, the Fed has possibly exposed the American taxpayers to unknown amounts of financial loss and established a precedent that could lead to future instances of companies in similar financial trouble expecting the same assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These extraordinary actions have raised a number of complex and multifaceted questions. As members of the committee of jurisdiction over our nations' financial markets and the regulatory bodies that oversee them, we feel it is imperative to have a full and public vetting of this unique situation. Therefore, we strongly urge you to convene a hearing on this subject of the Financial Services Committee on the soonest possible date.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for your consideration of this request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, April 14, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. GARRETT, I received the letter signed by you and sixteen of your Republican colleagues on the Financial Services Committee expressing your concern that the recent actions by the top financial appointees of the Bush administration in the matter of Bear Stearns have "possibly exposed the American taxpayers to unknown amounts of financial loss and established a precedent that could lead to future instances of companies in similar financial trouble expecting the same assistance."  It does occur to me as I read your letter that I have somewhat more confidence in the judgment exercised by Secretary of the Treasury Paulson and his aides and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and other officials of the Federal Reserve System than you appear to have, but that is no reason for us not to give this the fullest possible airing. So I do agree that we should be thoroughly examining this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where we may disagree is the context in which this happens. That is, I agree with you that we should have a "full and public vetting of this" matter, but I do not think it is necessary that we have the hearing "on the soonest possible date." I say this for two reasons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the Committee, as you know, is now engaged in serious consideration of the appropriate response to the foreclosure crisis that now confronts us. I realize that there are some who believe that we should take no action at all, but I think the recent movement by the Bush administration to expand the reach of the FHA, even though I do not agree with it in all respects--is recognition of the need for some action. I therefore believe that it is important that the Committee continue its efforts  on dealing with the current crisis, in cooperation with our Senate colleagues who as you know in a bipartisan way have also moved forward on legislation, although I do not agree myself with all aspects of it. My intention is to ask that the Committee continue to focus on this for the next several weeks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, I do believe it is important for the Committee to begin an investigation, including hearings, into the Bear Stearns issue, but not in isolation. It is important that we look at what happened with regard to Bear Stearns, not primarily as a matter of hindsight because in fact we cannot undo what was done, but rather from the standpoint of anticipating what the public response should be in similar matters going forward. This includes of course discussing whether or not these specific actions  taken in the Bear Stearns case were the best ones from the public standpoint, but also beginning the very important issue of what we might do in Congress to make it less likely that situation of this sort will recur. You  correctly note in your letter that what the Bush Administration did in this case did establish "a</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In summary, I agree that the Committee should be looking into this, not from the standpoint of rebuking Chairman Bernanke or Secretary Paulson, but rather as part of a serious consideration I of the causes of the current crisis and more importantly, what we can do to make a recurrence of the events that led up to the Bear Stearns response much less likely in the future.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, how much time do I have left?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will respond at great length later, but I would say this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said I did not oppose, myself, what they did. I was talking primarily about the Bush administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the ranking member said 17 Republicans out of almost 200 signed this letter. I don't think that's the majority of Republicans. They didn't oppose it. They raised questions about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it was the two highest ranking economic officials appointed by the Bush administration, Chairman Bernanke and Secretary Paulson, who did this; and it's the Bush administration that seems to me to be totally inconsistent here. So yes, I did point to an inconsistency between the Bush administration doing the bailout and their opposing this. I'm setting a precedent. I hope the citizens will think we are setting the precedent of coming to their aid from time to time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Madam Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I would like to yield 30 seconds to the ranking member, the gentleman from Alabama.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400010" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And responding to the chairman, first of all, I would say the letter that came back to Mr. Garrett from the chairman expressed the chairman's opinion that he had much more confidence in this bailout than the Republican Members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But secondly, he pointed out only 17 Members. In fact, that is the majority of the Financial Services Committee, and as Mr. Garrett asked earlier of the majority party, how many Democrats signed a letter demanding an investigation into the Bear Stearns matter? The response was none. All Members that have publicly in writing demanded an investigation were Republican Members, the majority of the Financial Services Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I will yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the ranking member for his comments and again bringing up what is a very important issue here. And that is fundamentally what we have before us is a Wall Street bailout bill. Now we all know there are some very significant challenges in our housing markets. But the answer is not to be bailing out lenders. They may be good lenders who made bad bets, and maybe they are the predatory lenders that we hear so much about. This bill doesn't make any particular distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people who can stay in their homes, if they just get a little help, we need disclosure. We need to enforce the law against fraud. There has been a lot of mortgage fraud on the borrowers' side, on the lenders' side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most importantly now, Madam Chairman, we need to prevent the single largest tax increase in American history passed by the Democrat majority in their budget which means that people who are struggling to pay their mortgages are going to have to pay more taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rising fuel cost, that's happened under the watch of the Democrat majority; the rising cost of food happened under the watch of the Democrat majority. They've been in charge of the economic policy of America for almost a year and a half now. It is the shrinking paycheck of the hardworking American homeowner and taxpayer that's at the crux of this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so what this underlying bill does is take $15 billion of money away from the school teacher in Mesquite, Texas, struggling to pay his mortgage; the guy who works at the Pepsi bottling plant in Mesquite; the rancher out in Athens, Texas; takes money away from  them to bail out all of these bad investors who made these bad bets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So you can't say that you were concerned about Bear Stearns and then all of a sudden turn right around and have this humongous Wall Street bailout bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is simple. Presently, you have a $15 billion bill, half of which are loans and half of which are grants. The purpose of the amendment is to turn this into strictly a loan program. Now, I don't believe in the purpose of the underlying bill. But, if you're going to bail out Wall Street and use taxpayer money, let's at least, at least try to make it a loan so that there is at least some chance, some chance that the taxpayer who's facing a $3,000-a-year increase in their taxes for a  family of four over the next 3 years under the majority budget, that maybe, maybe they have some small chance of recouping some of that money from all of these cities and localities. And by the way, again, the last I looked, almost every single State and municipality in America is running a surplus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Yet the Federal Government isn't, and so what does the underlying bill do? Hands out more grant money, more grant money on top of the $57 trillion of unfunded obligations that every man, woman and child in America already owes. Well, let's add some more grant money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, if it's that important to States and municipalities, maybe they would want to fund it or maybe they could take the loan money and eventually pay it back so maybe the Democrat majority wouldn't have to raise taxes on the Federal taxpayers quite as much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam Chairman, it's a very commonsense amendment. If you're going to do it, at least do loans and don't do grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise to claim the time in opposition.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>What we see here, Madam Chairman, is a fundamental difference between the Republicans and the Democrats when it comes to responding to the pressing needs of the American people. Let us look at really where we are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are in a depressed, recessed economy, which means liquidity is drying up, which means there is a slowing supply and circulation of money, which has been caused chiefly by a meltdown of the subprime mortgage market, and it has had a ricocheting effect throughout every fiber of our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people are hanging on by their fingernails. Between 7,000 and 8,000 American families are foreclosing every day, according to the Federal Reserve, not David Scott, not our Financial Services Committee, but according to the Federal Reserve, between 7,000 and 8,000 individuals are declaring foreclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That means communities all across this Nation are impacted. Not only is this a burden upon individuals, homeowners and families, it's devastating enough, but many of these foreclosures, when the property's foreclosed, that means folks are out of them. That means they are left vacant. That means they become fire hazards. That means they become havens to criminals. That means police services, that means fire services, that means a tremendous pressure being placed on already depressed city and county  and State budgets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And Madam Chairman, in every State in this Nation, there's been a 20 percent, at least, increase in foreclosures. So this is a problem of soaring magnitude, and the cities and the counties are already, many of them, moving ahead, but they are overwhelmed with the scale of this problem. And that's where the government comes in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a role for government. We need to respond to the needs of the American people, and nowhere is it more important than in this bill that has been very brilliantly designed by the gentlelady from California and our chairman of this committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now let's speak very briefly about this Hensarling amendment. And, I might add, the gentleman from Texas is a fine person. I consider him a good friend, but he is terribly, terribly wrong with this amendment. This is a terrible amendment because it does what we refer to in the South as, hold still, little fishy, and let me gut you. That's what this amendment does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It goes at the heart of this bill, because what he wants to do is take away the stimulus package for the local communities, and what he wants to do is to deny a way and a requirement in the bill so that we can help the poor elements where this bill says that you must serve those that meet at least 50 percent of the level of poverty. In order to do that, we must have the grant feature in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other point, as I mentioned earlier, a part of our whole concern in this whole economic issue is liquidity, which means we must have a stimulative nature in terms of what we do here in Washington, to stimulate the economy and put money into the economy. That's why we've got this week and leading on starting in next week $600, $300 and $1,200 checks. To do what? To stimulate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I take great offense from the other side when they constantly want the American people to think we're taking their tax money away and putting it in our pockets or hoarding it. This money is going right back to taxpayers to help to defray the costs of servicing these depressed communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The grants are needed, Madam Chairman, in order for us to serve those that are at the lower end of the economic level, which we must do and can only be done through grants. If his amendment is adopted, we won't be able to do that which hurts and almost kills this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other thing that it does, it does not allow us to apply the stimulus factor to the bill to provide needed input into this. I urge a defeat of this. It might be intentioned, I won't say well, but it is a terrible amendment from the gentleman from Texas.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman's time has expired.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, first, I would say to my friend from Georgia and other friends on that side of the aisle, if loans are so bad, why are they in the bill in the first place?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second of all, this bill does nothing to stop foreclosures, not a thing. Quite the opposite. Instead, it will increase foreclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What you have is an incentive for these investors to no longer do a workout with the struggling family, but instead, I can get bailed out. I can get bailed out by the Federal taxpayer. This is a bill that will help banks, Wall Street and States and does nothing for foreclosed families. It certainly does nothing for the taxpayer, and if we have a liquidity problem, which we do, let's cut the capital gains tax rate and you will see capital come into this market. I urge adoption.</paragraph>

  <chair>Amendment No. 5 offered by Mr. Kucinich:</chair>
  <chair> Page 2, line 13, strike "purchase and rehabilitate" and insert "preserve the equity and ensure the safety of the neighbors of homes made vacant by the predatory lending and foreclosure crises, to prevent and reduce the incidence of such vacancies through various means, including purchasing and rehabilitating".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Page 3, line 3, before the semicolon insert ", and largest increases in the rate of vacant and abandoned single family homes".</chair>

  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The primary beneficiaries of <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill> are the neighborhoods and neighbors of high concentrations of houses made vacant by the foreclosure and predatory lending crises. Helping those neighborhoods should be a nonpartisan and noncontroversial act. Such neighborhoods are the totally innocent bystanders of the predatory lending and foreclosure crises. Neighbors and neighborhoods are victims of the meltdown of subprime loans that preceded this wave of foreclosures, and there's no moral hazard in  helping the neighbors. The Kucinich amendment ensures that the funds authorized by <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill> are targeted to help the most needy neighborhoods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When a foreclosure leads to a vacant and abandoned property, this is what happens to the neighborhood: Crime goes up, as the vacant property can become home to criminal activity, drug places, and fire hazards; local government costs for police, fire and building inspections go up; vacancies go up, abandoned properties initiate a chain of events that begets more abandoned properties; neighbors lose equity in their homes, because vacant properties have a strong negative effect on the value of neighboring  properties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment clarifies that the purpose of this legislation is to help State and local governments "preserve the equity and ensure the safety of neighbors of homes made vacant" by the foreclosure and predatory lending crises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment also ensures that the neediest neighborhoods receive priority in the plans developed by States, metropolitan cities and urban counties. The neediest neighborhoods are defined with "high concentrations of vacancies," "large increases in the rate of vacancy" in the last 2 years, and "significant levels of loans determined to be at risk of foreclosure." These vacant property statistics have been gathered by the United States Postal Service and analyzed by the Department of Housing  and Urban Development, and their use will better target the funds authorized by <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is the product of a collaborative effort between my subcommittee, the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, and the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity and the Financial Services Committee. The amendment draws upon the academic research and input from practitioners in this area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is supported by community development professionals and advocates, such as Local Initiatives Support Corporation, the National Vacant Properties Campaign, and Smart Growth America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will place their letters of support in the Record at this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May 6, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CONGRESSMAN KUCINICH: We are writing to support your amendment to the Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008 that recognizes the important role vacant and abandoned properties play in the foreclosure crisis and the threat they can pose to communities across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By including the rate of vacancy in the fund distribution formula, this proposal helps to ensure that neighborhoods struggling with high rates of vacant and abandoned homes will receive priority in the plans developed by states, metropolitan areas, and urban counties. High rates of vacant properties put communities at a greater risk for crime, arson, destabilized housing prices, and other neighborhood problems. For many communities, dealing with the foreclosure crisis will mean taking steps to  recover and secure growing numbers of vacant homes, as well as figuring out the best ways to prevent these properties from having negative community impacts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for your leadership on this issue and we look forward to working with you on this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Geoff Anderson,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;President &amp; CEO, Smart Growth America.&lt;/em&gt;</paragraph>

    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SUPPORT CORPORATION,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, May 6, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR REPRESENTATIVE KUCINICH: Regarding <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008, Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) supports your amendment to focus the bill's resources on communities with rising vacancies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A primary purpose of <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>, which LISC also supports more broadly, is to help communities hurt by concentrations of home mortgage foreclosures. A principal indicator of this problem is the number and growth of vacant properties. Concentrations of vacant and abandoned properties have a corrosive affect on neighborhoods. Vacant properties depress the value of nearby properties, reduce the tax base on which states and localities depend, are a magnet for crime, and often undermine promising but  fragile progress toward revitalization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Your amendment is an important refinement to <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill> because it would direct states to prioritize the allocation of funds under the bill to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods with the highest concentration of vacant properties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We greatly appreciate your leadership on this most important issue for vulnerable communities and the people who live there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senior Vice President for Policy </paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge adoption of the Kucinich amendment which targets funds to the most needy neighborhoods.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of Representative Kucinich's amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His subcommittee has done an enormous amount of valuable work examining this targeting issue, and I want to thank him for focusing attention on the issue of neighborhoods where there are large and growing concentrations of vacancies resulting from the foreclosure crisis. They're exactly the neighborhoods I mentioned in my opening statement, ones that face the prospect of reaching the tipping point of deterioration from which they may never recover. Stabilizing such neighborhoods is an especially  daunting task for community leaders and organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think it is entirely appropriate, as this amendment does, to require States, counties and cities in their plans to prioritize these foreclosures and vacancy hotspots.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I know that this is no academic exercise for Representative Kucinich in his role as subcommittee Chair. He's bringing hard experience to the table from the neighborhoods within his district in Cleveland.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>, the "Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008," introduced by Congresswoman MAXINE WATERS, of California. I would also like to thank Chairman BARNEY FRANK for his leadership on the Financial Services Committee. I also support the Kucinich amendment to ensure accurate vacancy statistics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find it interesting that we are okay with a bailout of Bear Stearns, the fifth largest investment firm in the amount of 42 million dollars; however we cannot support assistance to the American Homeowners who are struggling to pay their mortgage, fill up at the pump, and get quality healthcare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As evidenced by the numerous housing and financial services bills introduced this Congress, we are in economic turmoil. I have been concerned over recent developments in  the housing and mortgage markets and worked with my colleagues to ensure that all Americans are able to get assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Legislation such as <bill type="h" number="3019">H.R. 3019</bill>, the Expand and Preserve Home Ownership through Counseling Act and <bill type="h" number="3666">H.R. 3666</bill>, the Foreclosure Prevention and Home Ownership Protection Act, include sections that speak specifically about foreclosures. They authorize studies on current defaults and foreclosures, as well as possible causes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill> provides for action. <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill> establishes a 15 billion dollar loan and grant program for the purchase and rehabilitation of owner-vacated, foreclosed homes. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will make the allocations to the States; 7.5 billion of the funds would be for loans, and 7.5 billion for grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond negotiating with the mortgage company, Americans need to know they have options. Sometimes it is the mortgage company who has given them a bad loan; <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill> offers some relief to individuals and families who need help, beyond their personal lender.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nationwide, the number of home foreclosures rose nearly 60 percent from February 2007 to February 2008, while foreclosures in Texas actually decreased 1 percent during the same, period. In fact, state-wide foreclosure filings in Texas dropped 17 percent from January to February.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite being such a large state, Texas ranks only 17th in foreclosures, below the national average. One reason is that Texas homeowners enjoy strong constitutional protections under the state's home-equity lending law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These consumer protections include a 3 percent cap on lender's fees, 80 percent loan-to-value ratio (compared to many other states that allow borrowers to obtain 125 percent of their home's value), and mandatory judicial sign-off on any foreclosure proceeding involving a defaulted home-equity loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though the rate of increase has showed slowing in the first two months of the year, uncertainties remain. Foreclosures are high and could still beat last year's numbers. Harris County, for example, racked up 2,219 foreclosures during the first two months of the year. That's compared with 1,915 during the same period last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had offered an amendment to <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill> that would provide for those who have been struggling to keep up with the rising prices of gas, the downturn of the housing market, and the incredible cost of health care. My amendment would not exclude from eligibility, individuals and families based solely on credit ratings or their credit histories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many individuals and families have credit ratings and histories that are less than required for the most-advantageous lending terms. These individuals should not be faulted for their struggle to make ends meet in these troubling economic times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have less than stellar credit due to the financial stress they have experienced trying to save their home from foreclosure. As a result, they have marred their credit. Families who have struggled to decide between paying their mortgage or paying for healthcare, families who have struggled to balance their need for shelter with their need for food are rarely able to maintain a credit score that qualifies them for a basic credit card, let alone a home or rental property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At least 50 percent of the grant money must be targeted to house families at or below 50 percent of AMI, and not less than half of this money must target families at or below 30 percent of AMI. Most of the people covered under this bill and at these income levels will not qualify if it is not clearly stated that they can be considered even with less than stellar credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans are hurting and they need help. <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>, provides much needed help to the states and to the families who are facing a housIng downtown. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and thank you, Congressman FRANK and Congresswoman WATERS, for this timely housing legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and give some relief to American families.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just a brief description of the amendment which I hope will prove noncontroversial. What I would like to do under the bill, though I'm not particularly a fan of the bill itself and its particulars, I would like to try to help to make it better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would, under the bill, require States to give first priority to veterans, active duty military personnel, National Guard, Armed Forces Reserves, schoolteachers and emergency response personnel when selling rehabilitated housing with funds authorized under <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Importantly, this amendment will not exclude those individuals who are low income, and does not change the underlying low-income eligibility requirements established under the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in as close to opposition as this noncontroversial amendment is likely to engender.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>I did note, and I welcome the gentleman from Michigan's affirmation, that this is not simply for banks, investment houses, pirates, lechers and other ill of sordid folk. He is seeking to give preference to veterans, members of the Armed Forces on active duty, members of the National Guard or Armed Forces Reserve, school teachers and emergency responders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with these priorities. It is, of course, an affirmation that this bill will benefit these people, unless we are to assume that they will be given a preference which is of no benefit to them. But if this bill is of no benefit to anybody but speculators, lenders and riffraff, then why give preference to these people? I agree with the amendment to that extent, and so I would just say that this underlines the point that there are very worthy beneficiaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But now I also want to return to the matter of the Bear Stearns issue. I will acknowledge, I did receive a letter from 17 Republicans, which is, by my math, not a huge percentage of 199 or 200 or whatever the declining number of Republican Members of the House is these days, but it is still not a very large number. And even in that letter, while it was not thrilled by the Chairman Bernanke-Secretary Paulson collaboration, it does not have one word in strict opposition to it. Nor does the letter  that 24 Republicans--a slightly larger number, but still not even 15 percent--sent to Mr. Bernanke again raising questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, yes, 24 Republicans have raised questions, Members of the House, about this bill. I will repeat that my accusation of inconsistency goes to the Bush administration primarily. They are the ones who engineered the $29 billion. They are the ones who are vehemently opposed to this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now some Republican Members did raise a question that said we should look into it and we're skeptical of it. I agreed with that. As I said in the letter, I think we should study it. I did think we should study it a little later for two reasons; first of all, I do believe  the subprime crisis is a crisis, some Members on the other side do not. There are, among the signers of this letter, some of those who, from their very conservative ideology, oppose  any action by this Congress regarding the subprime. I mean that quite literally, they oppose any action to deal with this. That's their right. But I would put dealing with the subprime crisis ahead of a backward look, as important as that ultimately will be, at what happened with Bear Stearns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, I want to look at what the Fed did there in the context of how can we make it less likely that it will happen again? I wasn't happy that it happened. I think there was a necessity in those circumstances. So what I said in the letter that I sent back to the authors was, yes, we should look at this in the context of the broader question: What powers do we need to give either the Federal Reserve or somebody else to make it less likely that this happens again?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, yes, I should, we should, look into it, but I think we should look into it not simply from a kind of retroactive bawling them out, but how do we prevent it or diminish the likelihood of it happening? But the inconsistency remains. Twenty-four Republicans said they had questions. On the whole, I haven't heard any Republican opposition to it. I haven't seen any resolution opposing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was the Bush administration, and this is my point: I thought it was unfortunately necessary. The Bush Administration, this is Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke, they were the ones who did this. And I think they have been responsible in trying to deal with this crisis. But for the President who appointed those people to now denounce this because it's going to help, among others--and by the way, let's be clear, if this amendment passes, as I hope it will, we will be giving preference under  this bill to veterans, members of the Armed Forces on active duty, members of the National Guard or Armed Forces Reserve, school teachers and emergency responders. So we have a Republican affirmation that these are among the beneficiaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And when you talk about bailing out investors and speculators, yes, that's what happened in the Bear Stearns situation. These were precisely the people who had done business with Bear Stearns. Now I believe that years of inadequate supervision of the economy, flawed legislation adopted when we repealed Glass-Stiegel and didn't put in regulations to deal with it at the time, that was supported by the Clinton administration and I voted against it. But when that happened, we invited the kind of  problems that the leaders of the economic policy of the Bush administration had to implement. And it is that administration which is therefore being totally inconsistent in this regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400260" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would like to yield 1 minute to the author of one of the letters in question, the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>I find it amazing and amusing that the chairman raises how many Republicans signed onto the two letters when, in fact, it evidences the fact that zero Democrats signed onto that letter and zero Democrats have done anything with regard to Bear Stearns for the last 2 months since this occurred. If there was even one Member from the other side of the aisle from the committee, when we invited the entire committee to sign onto it, I think the chairman would be in a stronger  position, but he is not because none of them signed on then. And even earlier this evening, when I invited them to sign onto an addition to it, none of them have come across to sign onto it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, I find it amusing when the chairman's response in the letter was that he has more confidence in Bernanke and the Fed than we do. So if your question is that we did not point out that there were problems with it, your response points out that--as I've said, I'm not quoting because I cannot get a copy of the letter back here--you had more confidence in the decisions and in the actions of the Fed and the administration. So if you had more confidence, maybe that explains why 2 months after  the action we are still asking for the chairman to hold a hearing on the matter, and here it is, 2 months later, all we are getting is rhetoric from this side of the aisle.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>I have said repeatedly that I did not oppose the action. And I am pointing to the hypocrisy on the part of the Bush administration. The gentleman from New Jersey, like Sherlock Holmes, unearthed the fact that I wasn't opposed to it. I said that. I think they were forced into it. So, yes, I did not sign it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As to not having a hearing right away, that is a done deal. I'm trying to prevent foreclosures now, then we will get back to looking in the rearview mirror.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400260" topic="">
    <paragraph>May I inquire as to how much time I have remaining.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman has 3 minutes remaining.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400260" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I would like to reemphasize the point made by the gentleman from New Jersey. The distinguished chairman of the committee is right, the Republican numbers are declining, and this painful experience with arithmetic has taught us that 17 is still a greater number than zero.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400260" topic="">
    <paragraph>The gentleman may potentially yield, but not at this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to point out that the distinguished chairman is right, the bill, if this amendment is adopted, would not be for speculators, simply for Bear Stearns, for Wall Street, would not be a big, bloated government golden parachute, but again, I think in this town, I think I'm being thanked for adding deserving people to something that may or may not help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You see, it's not the intent that we are debating, it is how we get to where we all want to go. Do we believe that this is the best way to go? I highly doubt that on our side that we would concur with that. And the reason that we cannot concur with that is, as I believe the gentleman from Georgia pointed out, there are fundamental principles at stake here that we simply differ on. That's all right. We agree on some things, sometimes we don't, but they're a matter of principle. And in the end,  the fundamental principle at stake is that our side believes that Americans' prosperity does not come from government, it comes from their own hard work and entrepreneurial investment. And what we want to see with this bill is an appropriate balance for the people that we truly are trying to help, for them who have made no mistakes,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All good people on both sides. And as for the chairman, I do believe he is a very honorable man. One of the places we do agree is on the Bear Stearns bailout. A lot of our colleagues on this side of the aisle screwed up their jobs and didn't get to walk away with $61 million. They walked away with far worse. And I think that the Bear Stearns issue, which is being conducted by Bernanke over at the Federal Reserve and the Secretary of the Treasury, both of whom work for the Bush administration--well,  one technically does--and who both were, I think on a bipartisan basis, confirmed by the United States Senate. So at least there's one thing we have in common, we aren't to blame for that. So I would look forward to working with him on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But again, I appreciate the support for the amendment, and I will yield to the chairman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>I just want to repeat, Members seem to think they're scoring points by saying, oh, they discovered we weren't opposed to it. I've said a dozen times, I thought they did what was necessary. I am not critical of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to go back and see how we can prevent this from happening again.  But there is no inconsistency on our part. We didn't say that was the wrong thing to do. The inconsistency is the administration that says yes to $30 billion to Bear Stearns and no to $15 billion here.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I offer this amendment to the Neighborhood Stabilization Act to ensure that illegal immigrants are not eligible for the financial assistance we're providing today to individuals adversely affected by the housing crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act governs the participation of noncitizens in certain HUD programs. It requires valid documentation from the beneficiary, verification of that documentation by the appropriate entity, and outlines who may and may not be eligible for financial assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under section 214, illegal immigrants are not eligible for financial assistance. Let me repeat that: Under section 214, illegal immigrants are not eligible for financial assistance. And my amendment makes certain that section 214 rules apply to the new programs authorized by the Neighborhood Stabilization Act that we are debating tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the housing crisis and economic downturn impacting the lives of hardworking Americans throughout the country, we need to make sure that targeted, fiscally responsible assistance that we are providing goes only to law-abiding citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars, it is our responsibility to ensure that every penny is spent wisely and is not used to benefit any illegal immigrants in any way.</paragraph>
