  <narrative>APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE -- (Senate - December 12, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10959">S10959</bill>]</narrative>
  <chair> The clerk will please read a communication to the Senate from the President pro tempore (Mr. BYRD).</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk read the following letter:</chair>
  <chair>PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE,</chair>
  <chair> Washington, DC, December 12, 2008.</chair>
  <chair>Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby appoint the Honorable CARL LEVIN, a Senator from the State of Michigan, to perform the duties of the Chair.</chair>
  <chair>Robert C. Byrd,</chair>
  <chair>Mr. LEVIN thereupon assumed the chair as Acting President pro tempore.</chair>
  <chair> .Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, one of the great privileges of my career has been the time I have spent working alongside Senator Bob Dole and his wife, Senator Elizabeth Dole. I feel a special kinship to the Doles. Not only are they both dear friends to Elaine and me, but in my position as Republican Leader I often think back on Bob's superb stewardship of the office. BOB DOLE was in many ways a model and a mentor to me. I was humbled and honored to assume a role that  he filled for so long with such dignity and skill. And today I am honored to submit for the Record a letter of tribute from my old friend to his remarkable wife at the conclusion of her Senate career. Elizabeth Dole has graced this chamber in the same way that she has graced every other institution of which she has been a part in</chair>
  <chair>The letter follows.</chair>
  <chair> December 12, 2008. </chair>
  <chair>Dear Mitch: I wish I could be a Senator again just long enough to speak of Senator Elizabeth Dole's accomplishments which have spanned a period of nearly a half century.</chair>
  <chair>Elizabeth correctly chose to focus her farewell remarks on those who helped and counseled her along the way. She spoke about those who were most important in her life's journey such as her mother, her father, her teachers, co-workers, and her dear brother, John, who passed away on April 8, 2008. John was her mentor, her confidant, and a proud naval officer in World War II. Elizabeth's speech was all about others rather than herself, which, in itself, says a lot about Elizabeth as a caring human  being.</chair>
  <chair>So in an indirect way, I want to share her many areas of service with all those thinking about their future and the path they will follow. Believe me when I say they will not find a better example than the Senator Dole from North Carolina. Senator Dole, in many respects, was a pioneer for American women, as many of her early opportunities came before women were in the forefront of public or private sectors of meaningful service activity.</chair>
  <chair>Elizabeth has never stopped looking for ways to make a difference. It would be impossible to determine the number of good people in North Carolina and across America that Elizabeth's efforts have had an impact upon, myself included. She assisted me three times in campaigning full-time for the presidency, taking a one year leave of absence from the Red Cross, but more importantly were the countless times she assisted me personally because of my disabilities.</chair>
  <chair>Let me recount some of the highlights of Senator Dole's career so that those who may be looking for a role model may fully understand the differences she has made for others, irregardless of party, race, religion or status.</chair>
  <chair>Public Service Career and Selected Accomplishments of Elizabeth Dole</chair>

  <chair>United Nations Intern Program</chair>
  <chair>1966-1967: Assistant at the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare </chair>
  <chair>After completing her Master of Arts in Teaching and her graduation from Harvard Law School, Elizabeth Hanford was hired by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Her assignments there included planning the first-ever United States government sponsored conference on education of the deaf. This conference, which spawned a career-long dedication to the rights of the disabled, was held in Colorado Springs in  1967. During this time, she took  cases for indigents, those who could not afford an attorney.</chair>
  <chair>1967-1968: Deputy Assistant for Legislative Affairs, White House Office of Consumer Affairs </chair>
  <chair>In April 1968, Elizabeth Hanford joined the Lyndon Johnson Administration at the White House Office of Consumer Affairs, working for Betty Furness. As Deputy Assistant for Legislative Affairs, she traveled frequently to Capitol Hill to advocate for policies protecting American consumers.</chair>
  <chair>1969-1973: Deputy Director, President's Committee on Consumer Interests </chair>
  <chair>Upon taking office in January 1969, President Richard Nixon renamed the White House Office of Consumer Affairs the "President's Committee on Consumer Interests." Virginia Knauer was appointed Special Assistant to the President for Consumer Affairs and promoted Elizabeth Hanford to serve as her deputy. Hanford would serve with Knauer for five years as a tireless advocate for American consumers, developing consumer education curriculum for America's schools, reaching voluntary agreements with  industry to undertake nutritional labeling and unit pricing, and helping to create the Consumer Information Center in Pueblo, Colorado. They were guided by the philosophy that for consumers to make wise decisions, they must have access to all relevant information.</chair>
  <chair>1973-1979: Commissioner, United States Federal Trade Commission </chair>
  <chair>In 1973, Elizabeth Hanford was nominated by President Richard Nixon and confirmed by the United States Senate to serve as a member of the United States Federal Trade Commission. Established in 1915, the Federal Trade Commission's duties include promoting fair competition through the enforcement of antitrust laws, preventing the dissemination of false and deceptive advertising of goods, and investigating unfair business practices.</chair>
  <chair>Seeing the commission as an opportunity to bring about lower prices for consumers, to ensure better quality goods and services, and to expand the choices available in a free, competitive marketplace, Commissioner Hanford's (married Senator Bob Dole in 1975) priorities included consumer protections for women and the elderly. She held seminars for women in business, and as the FTC enforced the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, worked with Women in Radio and TV on ads explaining how women, for the first  time, could get credit in their own name. Dole's work also included a comprehensive investigation of nursing homes and a number of antitrust and consumer protection investigations and enforcement actions.</chair>
  <chair>1981-1983: Assistant to the President for Public Liaison </chair>
  <chair>In January 1981, President Ronald Reagan named Dole Assistant to the President, to head the White House Office of Public Liaison. In that position, Dole played a key role in advancing the Reagan agenda to a wide number of constituent groups (for example, women, business, labor, religious community, Hispanics and other ethics organizations) and to the American people. Dole was instrumental in the passage of the Prompt Pay Act of 1982, which required the government to pay vendors on time or pay  an interest penalty.</chair>
  <chair>Dole also headed the White House Coordinating Council on Women, charged with reviewing government regulations to eliminate vestiges of discrimination, thereby increasing opportunities for women in government and in the country at large. The Council advocated legislation that would make it easier for women to collect court ordered child support payments, and to equalize Social Security benefits for widows and widowers.</chair>
  <chair>1983-1987: Secretary, United States Secretary of Transportation </chair>
  <chair>In 1983, President Reagan nominated Dole to serve as Secretary of Transportation--the first women in history to lead that cabinet department. The United States Senate unanimously confirmed her.</chair>
  <chair>Dole's many accomplishments as Secretary of Transportation included:</chair>
  <chair>Presiding over what, up to date, were the safest years in the history of American transportation--highways, railways, and airlines.</chair>
  <chair>Initiating widespread efforts to eliminate drunk driving, particularly among the nation's youth. These efforts led to the passage of legislation raising the drinking age to 21 to eliminate "blood borders" between states with differing age requirements.</chair>
  <chair>Instituting random drug testing of safety and security-related employees--the first civilian department to do so.</chair>
  <chair>Crafting a rule that resolved a twenty year controversy over automatic crash protection in cars. This rule totally changed the climate for auto safety in America, leading to the adoption of mandatory safety belt use laws in 49 American states and providing incentives for auto manufacturers to develop, test, and offer air bags in automobiles.</chair>
  <chair>Mandating high-mounted brake lights on cars. These "Dole lights" cost less than $20 per vehicle, and have been estimated to eliminate 900,000 crashes annually.</chair>
  <chair>Implementing rules that improved safety in aircraft cabins by making aircraft seats less flammable, improving aircraft cabin evacuation with low-level lights, and reducing the danger of fire in aircraft lavatories.</chair>
  <chair>Leading successful effort to pass legislation authorizing the transfer of two federally owned airports, Washington National and Dulles, to a regional authority, accomplishing a de-federalization move that had been proposed eight times since 1948 and had never been voted out of committee in either the House or the Senate. The new Reagan National Airport and doubling the size of Dulles International were thereby accomplished through revenue bonds, not federal taxpayer dollars.</chair>
  <chair>Leading effort for the reopening and redevelopment of Washington D.C.'s Union Station, which had been closed for over five years. Historic Union Station re-opened in 1988, and now houses dozens of shops, restaurants, and theaters, while also serving as a major transportation center.</chair>
  <chair>Selling government's freight railroad, Conrail, in the largest public offering of its kind to that date.</chair>
  <chair>Overseeing a 10% increase in the number of women in the Department of Transportation workforce, which had only 19% women in its 100,000 workforce when Elizabeth became Secretary.</chair>
  <chair>10-point initiative including rotational assignments and career development programs to assist talented women in moving up the ladder.</chair>
  <chair>First woman to serve as departmental head of a branch of the armed forces, U.S. Coast Guard.</chair>
  <chair>1989-1990: Secretary, United States Department of Labor </chair>
  <chair>In January 1981, President George H.W. Bush nominated and the Senate unanimously confirmed Dole to serve as Secretary of the United States Department of Labor--the first woman in history to serve in the cabinet of two presidents.</chair>
  <chair>Dole's priorities and accomplishments as Secretary of Labor included the following:</chair>
  <chair>Improving the skills of individuals entering the American workforce. This focus included the appointment of a blue-ribbon commission charged with developing national competency guidelines that reflected work readiness and which could be used by the schools for curriculum development; sponsorship of a first-ever national conference on the "school-to-work" population; expansion of work-based training along the principles of apprenticeship; and ensuring that the Job Training Partnership Act provided  basic skills, literacy, and remedial education along with job training.</chair>
  <chair>Instigating a "glass ceiling initiative," which revealed the barriers preventing women and minorities from reaching the top levels of corporate America.</chair>
  <chair>Traveling twice to Poland to assist that country in its transition from communism to democracy. DOL programs included the creation of construction training centers in Warsaw and Gdansk.</chair>
  <chair>Crafting a strategy that led to the successful conclusion of a bitter eleven month United Mine Workers strike against the Pittston Coal Company. Elizabeth visited the strike scene and traveled through a coal mine.</chair>
  <chair>Special focus on improving lives of youth at risk in our society.</chair>
  <chair>1991-1999; President, American Red Cross</chair>
  <narrative>(The first woman president since Clara Barton, who founded the Red Cross in 1881; Out of respect for the thousands of volunteers, she served her first year without pay.)</narrative>
  <narrative>During her eight years at the helm of the American Red Cross, Dole led a $287 million project that totally modernized and transformed the Red Cross blood operations begun in World War II. "Blood Transformation" integrated 28 different computer systems into a single centralized network; replaced 53 non-standardized testing facilities with 8 state-of-the-art labs to test for infectious diseases; standardized manufacturing processes across each of its 38 blood regions; and established a Quality  Assurance Program that became a model for the blood banking industry.</narrative>
  <narrative>Dole also led a massive four-year revitalization of Red Cross disaster relief services, establishing a National Disaster Operations Center open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to monitor ongoing disasters and impending threats; increasing to twenty-one thousand the number of those trained to handle national catastrophic disasters; and warehousing equipment in areas likely to get hardest hit.</narrative>
  <narrative>Dole restructured and strengthened Armed Forces Emergency Services, which provided an average of 4,000 emergency communications a day and other assistance to members of the Armed forces and their families. Her 3-year modernization of AFES included the establishment of two centralized Case Management Centers utilizing the latest technology to replace 145 stations on military installations.</narrative>
  <narrative>For the first time in its history, Red Cross chapters had to defend their charters, meeting high standards. Henceforth, they were required to meet those high standards every five years in order to keep their charters.</narrative>
  <narrative>10-point initiative to help qualified women and minorities move up the ladder, such as apprentices assigned to all senior managers.</narrative>
  <narrative>Throughout her tenure, Dole ensured that 91 cents of every dollar donated to the American Red Cross was spent on programs and services.</narrative>
  <narrative>Dole led humanitarian visits to disaster sites and war zones around the world, e.g. Kuwait; Somalia; Goma, Congo.</narrative>
  <narrative>2003-2009; United States Senator from the State of North Carolina </narrative>
  <narrative>In November 2002, Dole was elected by the voters of North Carolina to serve in the  United States Senate. Upon taking office in January 2003, Dole became the first woman in history to represent North Carolina in the Senate.</narrative>
  <narrative>In her six years in the Senate, Dole's accomplishments included:</narrative>
  <narrative>Leading a successful effort to protect North Carolina's military bases from closure and adding additional jobs, for example 9000 at Fort Bragg.</narrative>
  <narrative>Working to ensure a fair process that resulted in the basing of two F/A-18E/F Squadrons at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, which brings more than 1,200 jobs and an annual infusion of $40 million to the local economy.</narrative>
  <narrative>Securing nearly $4 billion in funding for rural North Carolina and preventing thousands of farm families from bankruptcy by achieving a tobacco quota buyout with no tax implications.</narrative>
  <narrative>Leading a bipartisan effort to extend family and medical leave coverage to military families.</narrative>
  <narrative>Successfully working for a law that protects service members and their families from predatory lenders.</narrative>
  <narrative>Successfully advocating since 2003 for a strong world class regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</narrative>
  <narrative>Securing $57 million for hiring customs agents focused solely on keeping illegal textiles out of the country.</narrative>
  <narrative>Securing $350 million in federal funding for North Carolina transportation infrastructure projects.</narrative>
  <narrative>Authoring legislation that provided increased grant funding to community colleges through the Higher Education Act.</narrative>
  <narrative>Working with federal officials and sheriffs across North Carolina's 100 counties to deliver the first in the nation statewide partnership to apprehend, identify and remove undocumented aliens who commit crimes.</narrative>
  <narrative>Helping to lead the effort to raise fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks in the 2007 energy bill to 35 miles per gallon by model year 2020, thereby saving 800,000 barrels of oil per day in 2020 and nearly one million barrels per day by 2021.</narrative>
  <narrative>Becoming a national leader in the fight against hunger, through the adoption of a farm bill that expanded funding for federal anti-hunger programs, and helping to secure more than $400 million for the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program.</narrative>
  <narrative>Convincing the Office of National Drug Control Policy to designate five counties in North Carolina as part of its High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program.</narrative>
  <narrative>Helping to lead the effort to reauthorize the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief at $48 billion, and $9 billion for prevention of malaria and tuberculosis, thereby preventing 12 million new HIV infections, treating 3 million people living with HIV/AIDS, and supporting care for 12 million people living with HIV/AIDS.</narrative>
  <narrative>Handling 40,000 cases for North Carolina constituents who needed assistance with a federal agency.</narrative>
  <narrative>These are just the highlights and while she did not always reach her goals, most of her life has been filled with successes because of her hard work, her faith, integrity and determination. Mitch, I'm proud of her record, as you are of Elaine's remarkable achievements, which included their work together at the Department of Transportation. I believe those who read this will be inspired to set higher goals for themselves and will accomplish a great deal more in their lifetimes.</narrative>
  <narrative>God Bless America,</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="ELIZABETH DOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the final gavel will soon bring to a close the 110th Session of Congress. When it does, we will all return home to spend time with our friends and families to celebrate the holidays. We will also have a chance to meet with our constituents as we prepare for the challenges the New Year, a new administration and a new session of Congress will bring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before all of that occurs, we will say goodbye to several of our colleagues who will be returning home at the end of the year. We will miss them and the important presence they have been in our lives and our work over the past few years. One Senator I know we will all miss is ELIZABETH DOLE, the Senator from North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's that time of year when we will be watching our traditional holiday film favorites and one that certainly brings ELIZABETH DOLE to mind is It's A Wonderful Life. I don't think anyone has had a more exciting or interesting career than ELIZABETH and certainly no one has a more impressive or detailed resume than she does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ELIZABETH has been a trailblazer throughout her life as she set out on a path to show others what was possible. Thanks to her, women of all ages across the country have a role model and a champion to look up to who has raised their sights as to what is possible for them to achieve in their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Looking back, ELIZABETH has been on the front lines of our national political scene for many years. She has broken quite a few glass ceilings, too, as she has taken a position of leadership and worked in the administrations of five Presidents. In the recent past she was often mentioned as someone who would make a good Presidential candidate herself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ELIZABETH really has lived a wonderful life. After her graduation from Harvard Law School she was asked to serve as a consumer affairs aide to President Lyndon Johnson. She then served under President Nixon, President Carter, President Ford and President Reagan, who asked her to join his administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ELIZABETH set another precedent when she was appointed to serve as the Secretary of the Department of Transportation. She was the first woman ever to serve in that post. It was another opportunity for her to make a difference and she got right to work. She increased automobile safety requirements, worked to raise the drinking age to 21, imposed tougher security measures at our airports, and helped to make our cars safer. All of these changes not only made our lives better, but they also  helped to save countless lives over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President George Herbert Bush then asked her to serve as his Secretary of Labor, a post that ELIZABETH would use to help identify and erase the barriers that were preventing women and minorities from moving up the corporate ladder. She saw her service as an important opportunity to change things and make life better for others, and once again, she succeeded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That would have been enough for most people, the end of a remarkable career, a wonderful life in itself, but ELIZABETH was just getting started. When she left public life and entered the private sector, she then took up the reins as the President of the American Red Cross. She was the first woman to hold the post since Clara Barton, the organization's founder held it in 1881. It was a difficult job and a tremendous challenge, but she was more than up to the task. ELIZABETH took  over a Red Cross in real financial trouble, but when she got through organizing and overhauling things, a large deficit turned into enough cash on hand to provide the kind of assistance the Red Cross is known for in the event of any local or national emergency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ELIZABETH is probably one of Duke University's best known graduates. Her North Carolina roots then brought her back home to make a run for the Senate. As she campaigned, the people listened to her and they liked what they heard. They decided that sending her to Washington to represent them would be a good idea. The record shows they were right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Senate, ELIZABETH has been at the forefront of efforts to ensure that our workers will have the training they will need to change careers and move on to better jobs in the current global economy. She had the insight to propose legislation to provide grants to small business owners so they could get the training they would need to be more competitive in the markets of today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the Banking Committee, ELIZABETH has been at the center of the action on the Nation's financial problems. She has played an important role in the effort to enact tougher regulations to stop predatory lending and place tighter controls on government sponsored mortgages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, ELIZABETH has compiled a long list of achievements and accomplishments in her life that would make anyone proud. She has received a number of awards and recognitions for her tremendous efforts as a national political figure. But, what is probably most important to her, is the fact that she has blazed a trail for others to follow and by so doing she has inspired a new generation of women of all ages to set a higher standard for themselves and what they think is possible for them  to achieve. In the end, that may be her greatest accomplishment of them all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is only a small part of ELIZABETH'S story and there are many more items on her record that are equally impressive. Together with her husband, Bob Dole, she has been part of a remarkable team and they have had a profound influence on the Senate and the Nation on every level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Diana and I will miss seeing ELIZABETH here in the Senate, but I have a hunch she will be close by to keep an eye on us and to keep in touch. She has had a remarkable career and a wonderful life and we were very proud to be a  part of it. We enjoy her company, her unique style, and most of all, we enjoy her friendship. We don't know what her next adventure in her life will be, but we will be watching with great interest as this exciting chapter  comes to a close and she begins to write the next.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my longtime good friend and colleague who, as one of 16 women Senators in the 110th Congress, has been a tremendous and cherished compatriot and an outstanding legislator, leader, and public servant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Chamber was truly fortunate and blessed to have someone of ELIZABETH'S background, understanding, and stature. A veteran of five administrations, Senator DOLE, upon her arrival in the U.S. Senate in 2002, brought with her an impressive depth and breadth of experience even by Senate standards, and a grace befitting her southern heritage combined with a tireless commitment to uncompromising substance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having acquired both a masters and law degree from Harvard University, Senator DOLE put the rigors of academia to good use in the pursuit of public service. She worked as a consumer affairs aide to both President Johnson and President Nixon and as a member of the Federal Trade Commission under President Ford and President Carter. And as a Member of Congress, I well recall ELIZABETH in her role as assistant for public liaison in the Reagan Administration--where she served while I  was in the U.S. House of Representatives. And she broke new ground as the first woman to serve as U.S. Secretary of Transportation--a post she held under President Reagan, and then as Secretary of Labor under President George H.W. Bush.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After ending her stellar executive branch tenure, Senator DOLE assumed the helm of the American Red Cross in 1991. And who could forget her valiant run in 1999 for the White House. As ranking member on the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I had the privilege of not only serving with Senator Dole, but also collaborating with her on issues affecting women in small business. Together, we saw an untapped capacity that women business-owners clearly possess to  contribute to this economy--and we have worked tirelessly to remove unacceptable and regrettable impediments to receiving assistance and contracting opportunities from the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, we introduced legislation which would amend the Small Business Act to allow women-owned small businesses to have a meaningful contracting program--one that would apply to a broad array of business industries across this Nation; and prevent the SBA from requiring agencies to admit to past discrimination in order to participate in the women's Federal contracting program. The fact is, our government is supposed to work for the people, not against them. Senator Dole understood that  basic tenet firsthand, as it impacted women business-owners, and was instrumental in championing our opposition to an egregious SBA rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to Elizabeth, all of us in the Senate are going to miss her presence and contributions to this venerable chamber--but as she is well aware, there are 15 of us who are losing more than a friend and a colleague ..... but also a compatriot ..... and, yes, a kind of sister-in-arms. We all have the sense of a bond born of serving together in this institution as a minority of our own. I recall having our dinners first at the Sewall-Belmont House, then the Supreme Court, the Library of  Congress, and the last one we came full circle by dining in the U.S. Capitol. Elizabeth, will certainly be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, on a very personal note, I don't think many of us will get completely used to a U.S. Senate without a Dole--and what an incalculable personal and combined service both Elizabeth Dole and our esteemed and beloved former majority leader, Bob Dole, have rendered to our country. So on this occasion, as we celebrate the exceptional contributions of ELIZABETH DOLE in the Senate and throughout her life, our warmest regards go out to her and leader Dole, and we wish them both  nothing but the best for the future.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the RECORD an article about Senator ELIZABETH DOLE, who will be departing the Senate this year. She has been my seatmate, and, I must say, she is my favorite in the entire Senate. A brilliant thinker, an incredibly hard worker, gracious, a person of sincere faith who lives it every day, she has lifted the Senate to a higher level throughout her tenure and through many difficult times. Her record of service, as Paul Weyrich  notes, is truly extraordinary. Throughout her long and distinguished career, her commitment to America has never been questioned. Her decency, experience, and leadership qualities have blessed us all. She grew up in small town North Carolina and the values instilled in her by family, church, and school were never lost. I wish her every success in her future endeavors and am confident that in this next stage of her life she will continue to contribute to the betterment of our nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The article follows.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>A Tribute to Senator Elizabeth H. Dole</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(By Paul Weyrich)</narrative>
  <narrative>A good lady is about to leave Washington, D.C. after decades of public service. I refer to Senator Elizabeth Hanford Dole (R-NC), who was defeated in her bid for re-election in the 2008 election. Dole married Senator Robert J. "Bob" Dole in 1975. President Gerald R. Ford named him his running mate after dumping the unpopular Vice President, Nelson A. Rockefeller. Dole was Majority Leader of the Senate from 1985 to 1987, when Democrats regained control of the Senate and he became Minority Leader.  Dole remained the leader of the Senate Republicans until he resigned his post to be the GOP Presidential nominee in 1996.</narrative>
  <narrative>All this time Elizabeth Dole was at his side. But she became an important figure in her own right. When Ronald W. Reagan was elected President in 1980 Dole became Reagan's liaison to conservatives, veterans and others. Soon Reagan named her Secretary of Transportation. By all accounts she did an admirable job. In the Administration of George H.W. Bush, Dole became Secretary of Labor. She and Bob Dole became a power couple in D.C.</narrative>
  <narrative>When Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) retired after 40 years in the Senate, Elizabeth Dole ran for his seat. He campaigned for her. She suggested she would vote like Helms and indeed she did. However, some North Carolinians suggested that her constituent services left much to be desired. And by all accounts she ran an inadequate re-election campaign.</narrative>
  <narrative>I watched with sadness as she questioned automobile manufacturers in the lame duck session of Congress. Soon she will have to pack up her office and head home. Her husband is now all but retired. This once-powerful couple is out of power. Dole is gracious about her loss. One would hardly know she had been defeated. Yet she leaves Washington having accomplished much in her service in the White House, the Transportation and Labor Departments and the United States Senate. This is one fine lady,  the likes of whom we probably will not see in this town for many years.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="ELIZABETH DOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, even before she came to the U.S. Senate, ELIZABETH DOLE was already a trailblazer and one of the most accomplished women in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when women who attended prestigious colleges and universities were rare, Senator Dole received an undergraduate degree from Duke University, as well as two degrees from Harvard University: a master's degree in education and government, and a law degree. She was one of only 24 women in her Harvard Law School class of 550.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She then began a public service career that paved the way for millions of women who have admired and followed her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After serving as the Deputy Director of the White House Office of Consumer Affairs in the Nixon administration, ELIZABETH DOLE was appointed as a member of the Federal Trade Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1981-83, she served in the Reagan administration as assistant to the President for Public Liaison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1983-87, she served as Secretary of Transportation, the first woman to hold that position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She joined the administration of President George H.W. Bush as Secretary of Labor from 1989-90.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1991-98, ELIZABETH DOLE was the President of the American Red Cross, the world's largest humanitarian organization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, in 2002, she won election to the U.S. Senate from North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the senior Senator from the Tar Heel State, ELIZABETH DOLE has fought for lower taxes, choice in Social Security, and comprehensive energy reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator DOLE, and her wonderful husband, former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, have made a tremendous impact on American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will miss working with Senator ELIZABETH DOLE, and I wish her all the best.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have come to the end of another legislative session and we are all preparing to return home to celebrate the holidays with our friends and families back home. As we close the books on the 110th Session of Congress, it is good to have this opportunity take a moment to say goodbye to our colleagues who will not be with us when the gavel opens the next session of Congress. We will miss them all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One Senator we will particularly miss when the next session of Congress begins is Gordon Smith. Gordon is a remarkable representative of his home State and he has been an important voice for the people of Oregon during his 12 years of service in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have enjoyed coming to know Gordon and having a chance to work with him on several issues of concern to the people of our States. During his service, he has compiled a remarkable record of success that has earned him a reputation for his ability to get things done in both the private and public sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gordon and I have something in common--a love of numbers and the intricacies of the law and how they impact the small businesses of our Nation. We are both aware of the importance of the small business community and the jobs they provide to the people of this Nation. Without them our local, State and national economies would be in even worse shape than they are right now. With them, there is great hope and confidence that we will be able to find a solution to the economic problems facing  our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gordon knows something about running a small business from the days he spent trying to revive the frozen vegetable processing company that had been in his family's hands. Because of the strength of his will, his determination to succeed, and his commitment to excellence, he was able to produce amazing results. He took what had been an unprofitable business and turned it into one of the largest frozen food companies in the United States. His incredible ride to the top earned him a place  in the Frozen Food Industry Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also earned him a spot on the Senate Finance Committee, where he has worked tirelessly to protect the small businesses of our Nation. His business sense and the practical experience he had of meeting a payroll and planning a budget helped him to master all of the details of our tax policy. He has an uncanny sense and a profound understanding of what works and what doesn't--and why. Fortunately, he has been at the right place at the right time and has known what to do to fix things and right  our country's economic ship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gordon's commitment to our families has shown itself in many ways, most notably, by his work to tackle the problem of uninsured children. He offered an amendment that passed the Senate that provided for an increase in Federal cigarette taxes to fund a program to cover some 6 million uninsured children who were eligible for but were not enrolled in State health insurance programs or Medicaid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He fought for our children because GORDON understands full well that they are our most important resource. If we don't provide them with affordable health care, a good education, and a supportive home environment that will make it possible for them to be successful in school and later in life, then nothing we do, no matter how well we do it will matter much in the long run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gordon knew it would not be easy to pass that amendment, but he was ready for a fight. He made it clear that if anything was worth fighting for, that was it. It really was no wonder, therefore, when he won a clear and decisive victory--not for himself, but for those 6 million children who now have a chance to live a happier and healthier life, thanks to Gordon Smith. It's another proud chapter in his legislative career--and it's part of a legacy of service to the people of Oregon  that will never be forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have come to know Gordon, I have thought that he is a little like me because we both love to confound those in both parties who are surprised to see us working so well with members on both sides of the aisle. We have both worked with Ted Kennedy and thanks to his willingness to help us pursue a common agenda, we have both been able to make progress on the issues that concern us and the people back home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the months to come, I believe we will most remember Gordon for the way he faced the personal tragedy of losing a son. I can only imagine the pain that comes with such a loss. Gordon handled that time in his life with great strength and shared his experience with us, not to draw attention to himself, but because he knew that "his having been there" would enable him to reach out to help those who might be facing a similar struggle in the lives of their own families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As he began to heal from that painful wound, he took that personal tragedy and gave it added meaning by working to pass a suicide prevention bill that now bears his son's name. It was another battle he fought because it was the right thing to do. He took up the cause because he believed in it with all his heart. As a result, the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act will forever serve as a loving testament of a father to the life of his son. It will encourage us all to reach out to those facing similar  problems so they can receive the help and support they need to go on with their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have always known Gordon to be a man of great spiritual strength, a former Mormon bishop who has deep personal and moral convictions. He has a strong sense of right and wrong and his inner compass has helped to guide him in the direction that he felt was best for his State and the Nation. He is an individual blessed with a strong and determined spirit who has a special place in his heart and his life for his God and his country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Senator Gordon Smith, with whom I have had the privilege of working throughout his 12 years of service in the U.S. Senate. Gordon has been a great friend to me as he has to so many of us--but most importantly he has been a tremendous asset to the Senate, the Nation, and certainly the great State of Oregon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since his election to the U.S. Senate in 1996, the people of Oregon have benefited immeasurably from Senator Smith's leadership. Throughout his service on numerous committees, including the Commerce and Finance Committees where we have served together, Senator Smith has been a credit to this body and has left a positive and lasting mark--exemplified by his tireless work on the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and the leadership he took in defending the Medicaid program  from misguided budget cuts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Above all else, Senator Smith always perceived his responsibility as representing his country before his party. There is no doubt that as we move forward into next Congress, I, for one, will miss his independent perspective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1992, when he won election to the Oregon State Senate, Senator Smith has devoted his life to public service--and his integrity and dedication to the finest ideals of service make him a role model for all Americans. Few who have held the position of U.S. Senator have been able to combine his candor, civility, aptitude, and absolute dedication to the public good that have allowed him to be such an effective, bipartisan Member of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What many may not understand is the camaraderie that we build with our fellow Members of the Senate. We spend aggregate months each year separated from our homes, families, and friends and in doing so, each of us becomes a part of an extended family. So it was the most acute and profound sadness that we all felt in our hearts upon the loss in 2003 of Gordon's son, Garrett Lee. And having read Senator Smith's book, Remembering Garrett, One Family's Battle with a Child's Depression,  I still find it almost unimaginable the grace and courage he displayed in continuing his work during the most difficult of times after Garrett's tragic passing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a testament to his humble nature, Senator Smith turned from his own loss to help others. And he forged a remarkable and indelible legacy for his son with the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act--legislation to which Senator Smith has dedicated his life. This act, which the President signed into law on  October 21, 2004, authorized $82 million for suicide-prevention and awareness programs, and represented just the first step Senator Smith  has taken to help prevent other families from having to experience what his has endured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ou Government is supposed to work for the people, and few individuals during my tenure in public service have exemplified this truism more so than Senator Smith. In the Senate, Gordon never allowed a party label to determine who he works with on critical legislation affecting our Nation. He had the skill to work across the aisle with intelligence and grace, and most of all, his highest priority was his constituents in Oregon. Whether he was fighting for transit funding in urban  Portland or assistance in coastal fishing communities and rural timber towns, Gordon always knew where his roots were, and he was invariably an eloquent champion for those issues that truly mattered for the people of Oregon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gordon, we thank you, we will miss you, and please know that you have left a positive and indelible mark on the Senate. All the best to you, Sharon, and your entire family for the future.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="ELIZABETH DOLE">
    <paragraph>Gordon Smith has served the people of Oregon extremely well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before coming to the U.S. Senate, he served as director of the family-owned Smith frozen foods company in Weston, Oregon, where he created jobs and spurred economic growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gordon Smith entered politics with his election to the Oregon State Senate in 1992, and he became president of that body in 1995.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since winning election to the U.S. Senate in 1996, Senator Smith has worked with his colleagues on both sides of the aisle on critical issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Smith chaired the Special Committee on Aging, and he also served on the following Senate committees: Commerce, Science and Transportation, Energy and Natural Resources, Finance, and Indian Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Smith has also courageously used family tragedy as a way to educate and encourage Americans on a very important subject: suicide prevention for young men and women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, I was so proud when President Bush signed the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act, authorizing $82 million for suicide-prevention and awareness programs at colleges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Smith also distinguished himself by championing rural Oregonians, including the many farmers and ranchers throughout the mountains and lake areas of his beautiful State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Gordon Smith for his dedication and service, and I wish him well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I too wish speak of my good friend, Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon. Senator Smith came to the Senate for all the right reasons, most importantly to represent the people who elected him and he has done an outstanding job of doing just that. Gordon never shied away from the controversial issues and often went against the majority position of his own party. Every time he did so he articulated in a very professional way his reason why he  was voting and the way he did. This always takes courage and conviction, and Gordon Smith possesses both.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will always admire Gordon's faith, which allowed him to survive personal tragedy as well as deal with the day-to-day decisions of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Gordon Smith is one of those Members who makes serving in the Senate a pleasure. I will miss his counsel, his advice, and his friendship. God speed to he, Sharon, and their family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JOHN SUNUNU&lt;ul&gt;</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="ELIZABETH DOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Senator John Sununu, an outstanding public servant and fellow New Englander whose common-sense approach to governance and dedication to problem-solving have well-served both his constituents of the Granite State of New Hampshire as well as his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is impossible not to like and respect someone of Senator Sununu's tremendous affability and enormous capability. Personable and analytical, John brought to the U.S. Senate what he exhibited during his accomplished tenure in the U.S. House--a welcomed engineer's perspective. So, we are losing more than a colleague of undeniable skill and integrity--we are going to miss his vital and refreshing contribution to this Chamber's national conversation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, let me just say, it's been my good fortune to serve with John on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation--specifically, the Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard as ranking member, and the Senate Committee on Finance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Particularly, as a member of the Ocean's Subcommittee, and former chair of the Subcommittee on the National Ocean Policy Study, Senator Sununu advocated for New England's fishermen and fishing communities through several difficult years. Moreover, as Maine's groundfishery continued to suffer under ever more stringent catch limits, and our lobster industry faced increasingly strict regulations, John's help was instrumental in keeping these issues at the fore and protecting one  of our region's and our Nation's most historic professions. For his tireless leadership on these crucial issues, we are forever grateful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On two additional topics that are also profoundly critical not only to my State of Maine, but also to the entire New England region--the vitality of Kittery-Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and the protection of the pivotal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program or LIHEAP, John and I have been vigilant, working hand-in glove to ensure the continued viability of these indispensable mainstays of our neighboring States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, in the 110th Congress, we--as part of both the New Hampshire and Maine delegations--working with the Kittery-Portsmouth community, union leaders, and Captain Mazzone and his world-class team--fought vigorously and successfully to secure $20.7 million in full funding for the construction of the Waterfront Support Facility at drydock #3--and $9.9 million for the first phase of a new Consolidated Global Submarine Component Facility. As a much-admired, "best in Navy performance" shipyard  that delivers the best work consistently on time and under budget, Kittery-Portsmouth Naval Shipyard--the oldest naval shipyard in the Nation--unquestionably deserved no less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it comes to the life or death matter of LIHEAP, since coming to Congress in 1997, John has, time and again, battled on behalf of thousands of families in New Hampshire who require fuel assistance to stay warm in their homes during the winter months. Senator Sununu was a stalwart addition to the chorus of those championing LIHEAP from New England and other affected regions around the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although there are truly serious subjects of public policy that bind us as New Englanders, nothing brings us together more than our beloved Boston Red Sox. And I dare say, one of John's fondest memories over the last 6 years likely has nothing to do with the U.S. Senate and everything to do with being from New England and a Red Sox fan--as Boston won not one but two World Series Championships, shattering the much-ballyhooed curse for good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the end, Mr. President, the true measure of a person is not making a living by what you get--but rather by what you give, and John Sununu, during his entire time in Congress, has given his State of New Hampshire remarkable public service worthy of its venerable heritage. By entering the family business of politics, John has indeed been a steward of the country's business, and we, and his State of New Hampshire, owe him a debt of great thanks.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="ELIZABETH DOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, soon the gavel will bring to a close the 110th Congress and we will say goodbye to several good friends who will be leaving the Senate and returning to their home States. We will miss them all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JOHN SUNUNU will be heading home at the end of the current session and I know I will miss him when the next session of Congress is called to order on the Senate floor. I have enjoyed having an opportunity to come to know him during his service in the Senate and on the Senate Banking Committee. He has always impressed me with his knowledge of the intricacies of our Federal mortgage system. It is clear he has always had the tools and the talent to be an effective representative for the people  of his State and he has always been a strong and effective voice for the people of New Hampshire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JOHN learned about politics and public service at a young age as he  watched both of his parents pursue their careers in their chosen fields. JOHN's mother was a school board member, which explains his aptitude for science and math. He soon turned his talent for numbers into a degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his interest in business into a degree from Harvard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the old adage says so well, he comes from good stock and a great political family. His father served as the Governor of New Hampshire and later as President Bush's Chief of Staff. He learned a great deal from his father about politics and what mattered to the people of his home State as he traveled around New Hampshire with his dad. He then put those lessons into practice when he made his own run for office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JOHN's initial run for the House led to three successful terms. He then launched a successful campaign for the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As soon as he arrived, he made it clear he was going to follow his own path and he had his own way of doing things. He had spent years working with the people of his home State and he had a clear view of those issues that were of great concern to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he was asked, he had a ready explanation for the reason why he had such a unique perspective on things. It was all due, he would say, to his long New Hampshire roots. He knew that the people of New Hampshire are known for their independence and they have a long tradition of great respect for the rights and freedoms of this country. That, he would say, has drawn my focus and sparked my interest in these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JOHN has been a welcome and spirited presence on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. His educational background has helped him to stay on top of the latest technological advances and developments and that has helped him in the effort to keep our regulations on the latest technologies up to date, current and effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yogi Berra used to say that you can observe a lot just by watching. I hope JOHN will forgive me for quoting the words of a Yankee legend to a Red Sox fan, but as I have watched him in action, it is clear from his style that he has a bit of Wyoming in him. Never one to look for opportunities to speak to the press or make lengthy speeches to get noticed, JOHN has always been focused on what he could do that would help to get things done. In my home State we like to say that you can  get anything done if you don't care who gets the credit. John is like that. He has been working to get things done for New Hampshire and he has earned the credit he has received back home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the issues that has always drawn JOHN's interest has been the environment, especially the quality of our air. It is a sensitive issue for him, and he has always shown himself up to the task of fighting for cleaner air for the folks back home. His long list of achievements on this and many other issues will be his legacy, a record of which he can be very proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the years to come, I will remember JOHN for his unique sense of style, his determination to get things done for his state, and his willingness to stand up for those things he believed in with that remarkable intellect of his. He's not just a smart guy. There are a lot of very gifted individuals who knew what had to be done but could just never do it. JOHN is a thoughtful man of action who has an in-depth understanding of the problems that face the Nation and a unique insight  into what will work and what won't. Simply put, JOHN knows how to make the right things happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now JOHN and Kitty will be returning home to New Hampshire to begin some new and exciting chapter in their lives. I don't know what they will decide to do, but I do know that JOHN will stay active and involved in the issues that concern him that carried him to Washington for these past 12 years to serve in the House and the Senate. He would be the first to tell you that it has been a pleasure and an honor to work for the people of New Hampshire, and I am certain we haven't heard  the last from him. For my part, I appreciate all his help on the issues we worked on together, but most of all, I appreciate his friendship and his willingness to play such an important part in the history of New Hampshire and the United States. He can be very proud of the difference he has made. He has been a good and effective Senator and the people of New Hampshire will always be proud of him and that they had the good sense to send him to Washington.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have really enjoyed working with JOHN SUNUNU. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>JOHN SUNUNU grew up in Salem, NH, and is one of eight children. He was first introduced to public service at a young age, when his mother served as chairman of the local school board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JOHN attended public schools, graduated from Salem High School, and received bachelor's and master's degrees in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JOHN also earned a master's degree in business administration from the Harvard Graduate School of Business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JOHN SUNUNU first ran for public office in 1996, winning election in New Hampshire's 1st District and serving three terms in the U.S. House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2002, JOHN defeated both an incumbent Senator and an incumbent Governor to become the youngest member of the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Senator, JOHN distinguished himself as an innovative legislator, bringing his extensive background in science, engineering, and small business to his work in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator SUNUNU has been a staunch advocate for low taxes, smarter regulation, and civil liberties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator SUNUNU is also a man of heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will never forget that in July 2005, to show solidarity with Senator SPECTER, who had lost his hair due to chemotherapy, Senator SUNUNU shaved his head.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since he is still a young man at the age of 44, I suspect that we will be hearing a lot more from JOHN SUNUNU in the years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish him well in his future endeavors.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300025" topic="ELIZABETH DOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Maine and New Hampshire have much in common. When John Sununu came to the Senate six years ago, I immediately saw in him those traits shared by the people of our two States: a strong work ethic combined with a great sense of humor, traditional values balanced by a spirit of innovation, and fiscal prudence always tempered by compassion. He quickly became not only a valued colleague but also a trusted friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John's extraordinary intellect, wisdom, and experience belied his young age and benefited this chamber and Nation. His upbringing in a family devoted to public service, his education in science, engineering, and business, and his experience in the House of Representatives made him a veteran from day one. His ability to analyze challenges and devise creative solutions made him an esteemed colleague.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the best tradition of the Senate, John brought his knowledge and experience to bear on some of the most pressing issues we face. In technology, he has been a leader committed to growth and advancement. He has been a devoted advocate for special education and rural health care. He has been a strong voice for our forest products industry and for a sound energy policy that would reduce our dangerous reliance on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been an honor to work with him on the Homeland Security Committee. His diligence and commitment have helped make America safer. His tireless leadership to reform the Patriot Act demonstrated his unwavering commitment to safeguard the civil liberties Americans cherish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his leadership on national issues like the Patriot Act and tax policy, John has been an effective advocate for projects of special concern to New Hampshire, whether it is low-income heating assistance and weatherization programs or the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. We recently worked closely together with our two colleagues to secure $20 billion for the shipyard's new dry dock to help secure its future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Above all, Senator John Sununu has distinguished himself as a champion of good government. He is an independent thinker who stands up--always--for what he believes to be right for New Hampshire and right for our country. He has a sharp eye for wasteful spending and is a resolute fighter for fiscal responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been an honor to serve with John, and I wish him and his family all  the best. I will miss serving with him day to day, but I know that he will continue to accomplish a great deal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PETE DOMENICI&lt;ul&gt;</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="ELIZABETH DOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor an undeniable, universally-acknowledged legend of the U.S. Senate, an outstanding public servant who has been a legislative master of this institution and its most labyrinthine but pivotal and influential procedures, and a U.S. Senator who, with passion and verve, brilliantly grasped the complex nuances of legislation without losing the broader perspective driving the national issues of the day. I am referring, of course, to the Senior Senator  from New Mexico, PETE DOMENICI. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his 36 years serving the people of New Mexico in this venerable institution, Senator DOMENICI embraced and confronted the most difficult or consequential of matters regardless of opposition or the complexity of the subject. Indeed, Mr. President, as our country faces myriad challenges, it is with a heavy heart that we lose not only an exceptional colleague and friend to many of us, but one of the Senate's finest legislators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the distinct privilege of witnessing PETE DOMENICI's sterling leadership and political acumen firsthand when he chaired the Senate Committee on the Budget from 1995 to 2002 in three successive Congresses. Having been a member on the House Budget Committee, I can tell you that serving on the Senate Budget Committee during PETE's chairmanship represented a magnificent opportunity for a freshman Senator--not to mention the fact that PETE empathized with me as he had been  offered a seat on the committee as a freshman Senator as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although PETE was quoted as saying that he joined the committee in 1973 "because it was available to me as a freshman, when other committees were not," history will show that the Senate Budget Committee, the U.S. Senate, and the country were all well-served because of PETE DOMENICI's undaunted command of the budget process and the esteem and respect with which he was held by his colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I joined the Senate Budget Committee in 1995 with Chairman DOMENICI at the helm, we worked hand-and-glove to reprioritize our Federal budget, instill greater fiscal discipline, and pass a balanced budget for the first time in 26 years. Success was going to require dedication and pragmatism or in PETE's words, "guts."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I well recall standing on the floor of the Senate as we were debating the budget resolution, and, referencing Winston Churchill's famous remark, I said, "I feel we finally have reached the `end of the beginning' of what I hope will eventually be known as the first seven-year budget to reach a balance in over a generation." And the force behind that legislative and budgetary milestone was the Senator we honor today, PETE DOMENICI. The ramifications of our work on that budget resolution,  along with our strong bipartisan 92 to 8 victory on the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, represent a historic template for how this institution tackles budgetary issues today and likely will in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, what has resonated the most through the years--and what is certainly one of the crowning hallmarks of his monumental legacy--is how PETE reminded us that the Senate can indeed achieve resolution by bridging the partisan divide and forsaking polarizing acrimony in favor of substantive action advancing the public good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator DOMENICI brought this same constancy of purpose and tireless commitment to the common good to his advocacy for mental health parity in healthcare coverage. Vigorously working across the aisle with Senators Wellstone and KENNEDY, Senator DOMENICI demonstrated that building bipartisan coalitions based on common objectives and good will were not only possible but fundamental to creating good policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Senator DOMENICI made his compelling case against the inequality of mental healthcare to the White House and to each Member of the Senate, his personal history with the disease was conveyed in a manner that could not have been more poignant and powerful. The story of Clare, Senator DOMENICI's daughter, mirrors that of millions of Americans afflicted with a mental health disorder, and Senator DOMENICI courageously recognized that he was uniquely positioned to help shepherd  the message that health care coverage should not financially discriminate on the basis of this disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Senator Wellstone characterized his partnership with Senator DOMENICI as, "an odd couple," where their political philosophies diverged, there common allegiance to making a difference paved the way for enormous strides that engendered an effective bond. And with stately leadership, Senator DOMENICI and Senator KENNEDY rallied the Senate, which at that point had mourned the tragic loss of Senator Wellstone, to action, passing the Mental Health Parity Act which the  President signed into law. Once again, Mr. President, Senator DOMENICI confounded the status quo and fought for meaningful change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we ought to have more, not fewer, "odd couples" and alliances in the Senate, given that compromise and conciliation are the true and necessary lifelines to achieving real results. To that end, my hope is that the Domenici-Wellstone-Kennedy example will constitute a model for generations to come of bipartisanship and comity. And I couldn't have been more pleased, having been a longtime leader on this issue myself, to work in accord with Senator DOMENICI in bringing this matter  to fruition in the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I cannot help but applaud Senator DOMENICI for his indispensable role in championing the 2005 Energy Policy Act. And while we had some differences on policy, once again, true to his relentless work ethic, his can-do optimism, and dogged determination, what was most conspicuously vital and on display was Senator DOMENICI's pragmatism in crafting this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Advancing this measure required Senator DOMENICI to compromise with his own colleague from New Mexico, Senator BINGAMAN. Yet they sought, found, and maximized the common denominators that would, in the end, allow this bill to be signed into law. It stands as an enduring testament to Senator DOMENICI that the final energy bill in 2005 passed with 71 votes, and Congress took a serious step forward in addressing our energy crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Time and again, Senator DOMENICI has placed legislative performance above political posturing, and a desire for concrete results above the din of discord and rancor. And in the process, Senator DOMENICI leaves a formidable legacy of establishing the standard for facilitating the budget process, providing mental health parity for millions of Americans, and forging a critical first step toward altering the course of our long-dormant energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For well more than three decades, this institution has been blessed to have among our ranks one of the giant legislators of his generation and our time, and we will miss you PETE and all you brought to the Senate, to public service, and to the people of New Mexico. As the son of Italian immigrants, who worked in your father's whole grocery business, and who would later become a minor baseball pitcher, math teacher, lawyer, and then a legendary Senator--you truly exemplify the very best  of the American story and dream. To Nancy and the entire DOMENICI family, thank you for sharing Pete with us and our country. We are all the better for knowing him, working with him, and calling him our colleague and friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my good friend and colleague, a true giant of this institution, and a consummate public servant, the gentleman--and I use that term with every fiber of the true definition of the word--the gentleman from Virginia, Senator JOHN WARNER. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in delivering these remarks, and most especially in considering Senator WARNER's impending retirement from the Senate, I have chosen not to focus on the tremendous loss to this body that will occur with JOHN's departure--though the dimension of that loss is indisputably monumental. Rather, I prefer to recall the incalculable contributions JOHN has made to enhancing this institution since his arrival here nearly 30 years ago--and his unparalleled commitment  to the state and the Nation he has served so honorably and so well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JOHN and I both came to the Congress at the same time--albeit to different chambers. I had long been familiar with Senator WARNER's outstanding reputation as a man of strength, character, knowledge and integrity from my days in the House. And it didn't take long for me to find out why when I joined him in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among many memories is my service on the Senate Armed Services Committee as Chair of the Seapower Subcommittee under JOHN's leadership as chairman--and the command and the focus and the vision that he brought to that critical panel. I can tell you, with his long service on the committee--and of course as a former Secretary of the Navy, there wasn't anyone who instilled greater confidence when it came to meeting the challenges of limited defense dollars and the reality of that post-Cold  War period than JOHN WARNER. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>I certainly well recall that at a time when our foreign policy had quite frankly made our Navy into America's "Emergency 9-1-1" force, with a 331 percent increase in contingency operations at that time from the previous ten years, at a time when the branches of the services weren't meeting their recruitment goals and the Air Force and Navy were woefully short of pilots, at a time when China was continuing to make quantum leaps in military technology, Senator WARNER's expertise and leadership  didn't arrive a moment to soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember an instance when he called our allies to account on Kosovo--when he saw that our European partners had deployed only 722 of the 1,264 policemen they had promised to provide as part of the Kosovo Police Force, he held them to their commitment. He exposed that inequity and thanks to his hand at the helm they began to change their course.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From day one as chairman, Senator WARNER was relentless in scrutinizing existing defense programs as well as articulating a vision for the future. And no where was that more in evidence--or more prescient, for that matter, than when he created the Emerging Threats Subcommittee, to address everything from cyberterrorism to terrorist threats here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, as I said at an event at the time, "the fact is, since Soviet power has receded from the heart of Europe, the United States faces more regionally diverse and unpredictable challenges to its national security than ever before. And John knew we must be prepared to respond." Well, that was and is the JOHN WARNER I know--always looking ahead, always anticipating the next challenge, and always working to meet those challenges head on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And above all else, no one, no one, is more concerned about the welfare and well-being of our brave men and women in uniform than JOHN WARNER. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Interestingly, Senator WARNER was Undersecretary of the Navy while the late Senator John Chafee served as Secretary. And might I just say as an aside, what an extraordinary duo would come out of the Pentagon to subsequently serve side-by-side in the United States Senate. And like John Chafee, JOHN WARNER earned the unwavering respect of our military men and women because of his unflagging respect for each and every one of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly, Senator WARNER has always had unlimited enthusiasm and commitment for the men and women of the Navy and Marine Corps. In fact, I understand that, in a time before there were elevators and escalators in the Pentagon, he was known for quite literally bounding up the steps "two by two" in the mornings, and that he did so every morning to get to his office to serve the officers, sailors, and Marines for whom he cared so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am certain it is that very spirit that explains why he is so beloved by our members of the armed forces of the United States. I am certain it is also that spirit that's made him so beloved by members of this United States Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a spirit not only of "can do", but of "must do". It's an honor-bound dedication to the notion that we all have a sworn duty to our constitution and to our country to leave a better nation for having acted in our country's best interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a quality we witnessed once again during historic debates on our course in our war in Iraq. Senator WARNER consistently brought to bear his credibility, his gravitas, and his experience to elevate the Senate's deliberations and rise above the din of partisanship. What JOHN WARNER said on the matter of Iraq--or on any military issue of vital import--carried the weight of an intellect pledged solely to the concept and pursuit of doing what is right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And at no time was JOHN's sense of the greater good more evident than in JOHN's leadership in the so-called "Gang of 14"--at a crossroads when the very institution of the Senate was caught in the cross-hairs of a struggle over judicial nominations. As we recall, at the time, the repeated, systemic filibuster of the President's nominees had been a corrosive force on the Senate. At the same time, the repeated, systematic filibuster of the President's nominees had been a corrosive  force on the Senate. At the same time, exercising the so-called "nuclear option"--that would have jettisoned the traditional rules governing these nominations--would truly have had longstanding consequences for the future of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we set aside partisan differences to help forge consensus to safeguard a body constituted to be neither a rubber stamp nor a personalized veto. Just when we were about to cross a political Rubicon, this watershed compromise embraced and preserved the essence of our Founding Fathers' vision to achieve results through accommodation--and embodied the best traditions of the Senate. And JOHN WARNER was instrumental in standing up and leading that charge--once again, lending the gravity  of his standing in the Senate to advance that crucial cause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when I think of JOHN WARNER, I think of an embodiment of what our forefathers quite likely had in mind when they envisioned a U.S. Senator. Someone who is learned, who is deliberative, who is compassionate, who is considered, who is experienced, who is reasoned and measured in approach--but who is most undeniably unafraid to act decisively when circumstances demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the caliber of the man to whom this institution is about to bid farewell. And as we do so, I also cannot help but recall the proud tradition of extraordinary thinkers and leaders that the great Commonwealth of Virginia has produced over centuries--the ranks of which JOHN WARNER is most unquestionably fit to occupy. What a credit he has been to his State, what a legacy he contributes to Virginia, and certainly to America. The people of Virginia could not have asked for a more eloquent  and powerful voice in the U.S. Senate--and it was a powerful voice not for the brashness of its volume or tone, but because of the credibility and thoughtfulness behind the words and thoughts that voice delivered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Quite simply, he is truly one of the best--deeply respected, highly regarded, a principled, independent-minded voice of reason. He is what we need more of in government. And he sets an example for us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has also been a great friend to me--as he has to so many of us. I will miss the firmness and sincerity of his warm "hellos". I will miss running into him in the hallways, on the Senate subway, on this floor. I will miss his institutional wisdom and depth and breadth on the issues. I will miss his kindness and comradery. And, I imagine, there are 98 others in this Chamber who feel likewise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let me just say, farewell, JOHN WARNER. And while none of us want to see you go, there is certainly unanimous consent that--as you yield the floor for the final time--no one is more deserving of this time to now spend with your family, your friends, and with whatever personal pursuit you may choose--than you, John, as a public servant of so many years, a public servant of great accomplishment, and a public servant of such positive and indelible consequence to the Senate, and  to America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, it has been one of my great honors to serve with one of the most distinguished Senators in our body, Senator John Warner of Virginia. A man of great wisdom, a man committed to the country that he has served for many decades in a host of important positions. John Warner has never failed his Nation. In addition to his knowledge and  judgment which I so deeply respect and have so often followed, he is a true  delight to be with and has the rare collegial skills to bring highly intelligent and committed Senators together for the common good. As chairman of the Armed Services Committee, as its ranking member and in the last 2 years as its de facto ranking member he has continued his record of superb service. We have gone through many difficult times and without his leadership I don't see how we could have worked our way through some of our Nation's great challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Warner is a product of the heart of Virginia. Our affectionate title of "squire" reflects the recognition of his Virginia heritage and style. Among other good qualities no one is more delightful to travel with than JOHN WARNER. I cherish the opportunity to have listened to many of his stories both humorous and insightful. He is a walking student of American history. I urged him to seek reelection but he chose not to. He will be greatly missed. My best wishes go with him  and his wife Jeanne.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I wish to speak of the retirement from the Senate of my friend Senator John Warner. Senator WARNER is the quintessential Virginia Gentleman. He is gifted of speech, courteous, possesses courage and conviction, and is a defender of freedom and the Senator most committed to the protection of our men and women in uniform as well as their families. It has been my privilege to serve with Senator Warner on the Armed Services Committee. His leadership as Chairman  was superb. His commitment to protecting America and Americans is unparalleled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From his days in the U.S. Navy to his years as Secretary of the Navy to his years in the U.S. Senate, John Warner has provided the kind of service and leadership that Virginians and Americans appreciate and respect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will miss John Warner but certainly wish him and Jeanne Godspeed as they continue life's journey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TED STEVENS &lt;ul&gt;</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="JOHN WARNER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is always a bittersweet moment as the clock winds down on the last minutes of the current session of Congress and we start to pack up and get ready to head home for the holidays. As we do, it's always good to take a moment to reflect on all we have accomplished over the past 2 years and those special Senators who did a lot of the heavy lifting who will be returning home at the end of the year. That is when we begin to realize just how much they will be missed. Such  a Senator is Ted Stevens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Ted leaves Washington for his beloved Alaska, he will long be remembered for a long list of achievements in the Senate. The fact that he is the Senate's longest serving Republican is no accident. It came abut because Ted always had one foot in Washington and the other in his home State of Alaska. He was always heading back home whenever it was possible to keep in touch with the people of his State and let them know what he was doing on their behalf in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ted has an affection for super heroes and that is no surprise because Ted is one. He may not be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, but he was able to make sure that the needs of his constituents were heard and addressed unlike any other Senator for his entire Senate career. The people of Alaska watched Ted hard at work in Washington and they liked what they saw. It isn't any wonder that the folks back home call him not Senator Stevens but Uncle</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Ted returns home, Alaska will have lost a powerful force in the Senate. He is not only his State's greatest fighter, but he is also Alaska's best ambassador. He loves his State and he loves showing it off whenever he can. Many of us have had a chance to enjoy a wonderful dose of his special brand of Alaskan hospitality when we have had a chance to take a trip to visit that remarkable land up north.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I love fishing and hunting and all the activities that are possible in the great outdoors. So, for me, it was a special pleasure to be in Alaska and have a chance to take part in Ted's Kenai Tournament. Alaska is a magical place and the fishing and the scenery there is second only to Wyoming. More importantly, the Kenai Tournament is more than a social occasion or a chance to get in some great fishing during a break. It has a much more important purpose. The tournament was created to  help raise the funds that are needed to restore and improve the habitat of the salmon in Alaska and over the years it has done a remarkable job of both protecting and helping to promote the wonders of his home State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It might surprise some people to learn how much Ted loves the environment of his State and how concerned he is that it continues to be preserved for future generations to enjoy. It's a cause that Ted has worked on as he dealt with all of us in working to pass bills that would help to keep Alaska's great outdoors open and available to all those who love to hike, fish, hunt or just stand back and admire the scenery. Like me, Ted knows that our national treasures should  be maintained not by excessive and intrusive regulation, but through the efforts of good stewards of the land who understand its value and its importance to our future as a nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For almost 40 years, whenever it came to fighting for Alaska's best interests on the Senate floor, or promoting the treasures of Alaska at home or here in Washington or anywhere in between, Ted Stevens has been the voice of Alaska. Whenever an issue was brought up in the Senate that affected his State, we all knew immediately to find out what Ted thinks. He always knew what would be best for Alaska and when he spoke, we all stopped to listen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alaska is perhaps best known for its towering spectacular and imposing mountains that seem to rise dramatically right out of the ocean. It is the perfect backdrop for Ted Stevens who is a man to match their mountains. TED is a landmark of service and he has achieved a mountain of results for the people of his State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have come to know Ted I have become very aware of the truth of the old adage that it isn't the number of years in your life that determines who you are, it is the amount of life in your years. For his entire Senate career, Ted has kept up an incredible pace and he has the results to show for it. He just celebrated his birthday and I can say that he is a very young 85 years of age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He won't mind my mentioning his age. He's proud of it. He's earned every year of it and he certainly hasn't been taking it easy. At a time in his life when most people his age are sitting back and relaxing, Ted has been fighting here in Washington to protect their benefits, keep their taxes under control, and reduce Federal spending so that they could have the peace of mind that comes from knowing that things are in good hands--Ted's hands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ted and I get along so well because in a lot of ways, Wyoming is a lot like Alaska, and that often puts Ted and me on the same side on a lot of issues. We both understand the needs of rural America, and we both know how important it is to see that those needs are met.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His determination to serve the people back home was most evident when he took aim at keeping universal phone service in operation. He knew how important phone service is to people, especially those in isolated areas. For them, a phone is more than just an instrument they can use to keep in touch with others. For those in remote regions, a phone is their lifeline. It helps to provide them with the peace of mind that comes from knowing they can place a call and report an emergency whenever they  are facing a life threatening emergency. For them and for all Alaskans, there was never any substitute for knowing that the Senator who speaks for you, understands your life and your needs and Ted has been the one to do that--ever since he first came to Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will be tough to say goodbye to Ted when he leaves Washington because I will miss having him riding shotgun as we go to work on those issues that are going to make a difference in the lives of the people of our states. As we say in Wyoming, Ted is a guy who walks the walk and doesn't just talk the talk. He says what he means and he means what he says. You know just where you stand when you deal with Ted and he has never been one to back down from a fight in committee  or on the Floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the years to come, whenever I think of Ted I will remember him as a man of action who knew it was more  important to get things done than to talk about doing things. He was always quick to put his words into action and get results. He has a wealth of knowledge about how to get things done in the Senate--and done right. When it comes to being an effective Senator, Ted could have written the book on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I won't say goodbye, Ted, I will just say we'll see you around town. I have no doubt that we will keep in touch with you and I am sure you will keep in touch with us--whenever something comes up in the Senate that we need to fine tune to make sure it treats Alaskans just right. Thanks for all you have done for me, for the West, for Alaska and for this Nation. Thanks most of all for your friendship. That is something I will always treasure most of all.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="JOHN WARNER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak about my great friend, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, who has served in the U.S. Senate for 40 years and is the longest-serving Republican Senator in history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal note, I have always enjoyed working with Senator Stevens, and it has been a true privilege to collaborate with him on some of the most important issues facing our great Nation--including energy, health care, and national defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Stevens' service to the United States didn't begin when he stepped inside this Chamber. Rather, his service began decades earlier--during some of the most harrowing days of World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Stevens was part of the Greatest Generation who fought and won that global struggle for freedom--flying a C-47 in the China-Burma-India theater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Incredibly, over 1,000 of Senator Stevens' fellow airmen died "flying the hump" and elsewhere in the China-Burma-India theater--a sobering reminder of the high price of freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For his heroic efforts, Senator Stevens later received two Distinguished Flying Crosses and two Air Medals, as well as the Yuan Hai medal awarded by the Republic of China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the war, Senator Stevens completed his education at UCLA and Harvard Law School, and then moved to Alaska, which was then a U.S. territory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the city of Fairbanks, Senator Stevens practiced law for several years, until he came to Washington, DC to serve in the Eisenhower administration, and also to lobby for Alaska's admittance into the Union--a mission that succeeded in 1959.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Senator Stevens returned to Alaska, he ran for--and won--a seat in the Alaska House of Representatives, and later became House Majority Leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, in December 1968, Governor Walter J. Hickel appointed him to fill a vacancy in the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1970, the voters of Alaska ratified that choice by electing Senator Stevens to finish that term in a special election, and then re-electing him six more times, always by overwhelming margins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Stevens' achievements are legendary in this Chamber--including (but not limited to) Chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate--putting him third in line for the Presidency from January 2003 to January 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For his many decades of service, Senator Stevens has received and accepted numerous honors--including having the Anchorage International Airport named after him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our entire country has been enriched and improved by his hard work, dedication, and leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say this, not as a distant observer, but as an up-close witness to his achievements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back in 1993, when I first arrived in the U.S. Senate, I was one of only seven female Senators, and if the Senate was a men's club, then the Appropriations Committee was its inner sanctum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was not a single woman on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, but that's where I wanted to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I explained to Senator Stevens--who was then the ranking member of the committee--that Texas has more Army soldiers than any other State, more Air Force Airmen and women stationed in Texas than any other State, and our defense industry builds everything from fighter aircraft to Army trucks to artillery systems to sophisticated electronics equipment for the Pentagon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, it was absolutely essential that a Senator from Texas serve on that committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After some careful thought, Senator Stevens agreed and welcomed me to the committee. And since that time, he has been a valuable mentor to me--not to mention a passionate advocate for Alaska and America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And when I say passion, I really do mean passion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Stevens has been known to show dramatic performances on the Senate floor, keeping wandering eyes focused on the urgent issues that need to be addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One day, during a mark-up in the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, who chaired the committee at the time, grew very animated and laid down the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When a frustrated senior Senator told Senator Stevens that "there was no reason to lose your temper," Senator Stevens glared back and responded, "I never lose my temper. I always know exactly where I left it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if Senator Stevens has a temper, he also has a compassionate heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will never forget when a group of protestors gathered outside of the Appropriations Committee conference to demand increased funding for breast cancer research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One particularly agitated advocate got in Senator Stevens' face and said, "If men were dying of breast cancer, you wouldn't think twice about increasing the funding."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Needless to say, those words made quite an impact on Senator Stevens, but probably not what this advocate anticipated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Senator Stevens walked back into the conference, he repeated the charge and then looked around at his mostly male colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He knew that at least six of them suffered from prostate cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also noticed that the bill they were considering didn't fund prostate cancer research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But thanks to the excellent suggestion of the woman in the hallway, he was going to advocate breast cancer research and prostate cancer research. Senator Stevens was determined to become a leader on these issues, and over time, that is certainly what he's become.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Senator Stevens on all that he's accomplished for Alaska and America, and I wish him well in his retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHUCK HAGEL&lt;ul&gt;</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="JOHN WARNER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to express my enormous gratitude and deep appreciation to my good friend and colleague, Senator Chuck Hagel, for his 12 years of sterling leadership and steadfast service in the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A man of deep-seated principle, honor, conscience, and conviction, Senator Hagel has been a stalwart legislator and an unwavering guardian of the first branch of government during his remarkable two-term tenure in the Senate. And, having served with Chuck side-by-side for that entire period--including, in the 107th Congress on the Senate Committee on the Budget, and subsequently for the remaining three Congresses on the Senate Committee on Intelligence--I can attest firsthand  to the tremendous intellect, independence, and integrity that he has brought to his office and to some of the most consequential debates of our time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Anyone familiar with Senator Hagel's background will notice readily how a fourth generation Nebraskan steeped in the time-honored traditions and mores of the heartland was well-equipped with the bedrock character and unshakable foundation necessary to reach the highest heights in both the public and private sector. Whether serving as President Reagan's Deputy Administrator of the Veterans' Administration, demonstrating keen entrepreneurial acumen as an early leader in the cellphone industry,  heading the World USO, or eventually running successfully for the U.S. Senate from Nebraska, the common denominator, time and again, pervading Senator Hagel's life--and what has shaped his renowned trajectory of accomplishment in every undertaking he has pursued--has been his unwavering love for his country and abiding faith in its founding principles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nowhere was Senator Hagel's devotion to our Nation more paramount  than when his country called on him to serve in Vietnam, where he and his brother Tom, having bravely enlisted together, fought shoulder-to-shoulder as infantry squad leaders with the U.S. Army's 9th Infantry Division. Both displayed enormous heroism on the field of battle and were decorated soldiers, with Chuck earning two Purple Hearts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you can imagine, it has been a privilege over these past 12 years to witness the courage and candor of this American hero and esteemed colleague, whether on measures addressing war, specifically in Iraq, or matters concerning the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA. Senator Hagel was indeed my compatriot and ideological soul mate on the Senate Intelligence Committee. If you must go into battle whether in war or in politics, you want to engage your opponents with someone of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A true conservative who believes in limited government--and that the diffusion of power and authority are the surest check against despotism and the best hope for democracy--Senator Hagel has demonstrated a visceral and unending passion for this institution and for the possibilities of effective governance by people of good will. And Senator Hagel crystallized this deeply held belief in his farewell speech on the floor of the Senate when he emphasized to his colleagues that</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Article I of the constitution is about the Congress. We are a co-equal branch of government. And if anything I've learned in the 12 years I've been here is the importance of sharing, participating in the governance of our country, being part of that governance, helping make decisions with the president and the executive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, as a Mainer, I must say how fitting it was that a few years ago Senator Hagel was recognized as one of the esteemed recipients of The Edmund S. Muskie Distinguished Public Service Award. Senator Hagel exemplifies the best of the Muskie tradition which was built upon certain irrefutable, sterling standards for high intellect, unassailable integrity, and a lifetime of legendary service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To his wife Lilibet and their daughter Allyn and son Ziller, thank you for sharing your husband and your father with us for these 12 years. And to Chuck, we will miss your voice and your vision. By your words and in your deeds, you bring to mind the Greek playwright and poet, Aeschylus, who wrote that "his resolve is not to seem the bravest, but to be." You have been a brave steward of the public trust, and we are forever thankful.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="JOHN WARNER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, one of the great privileges of my tenure in the Senate has been to serve with my colleague Wayne Allard from Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He and his wonderful wife and partner Joan have contributed greatly to the life of the Senate. Wayne has been a leading advocate for a strong space and missile defense program, an important issue when he chaired the Strategic Subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Armed Services. I was honored to follow him in that position when he moved to the prestigious Appropriations Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wayne has also been a firm and consistent voice for a sound economic policy based on the free market, lower taxes, free trade, and restraint in spending. Day after day--year after year--he never wavered in those principles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I deeply regret that Wayne took a pledge to not seek a third term in the Senate. His unqualified commitment to principle will be sorely missed. Wayne is a man of integrity, and he never hesitated to keep the promise he made to the voters of Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wayne and I came to the Senate together. We have been good friends throughout our time here. We have stood together in the Armed Services Committee in support of our men and women in uniform. We were thrilled to see the child tax credit become law, providing relief to hard-working American families. We witnessed many other important pieces of legislation be enacted into law. And we were able to stop quite a few bad pieces also.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mary and I send our best and most sincere wishes to Wayne and Joan. I know that he will continue to contribute to the good of Colorado and to the Nation.</paragraph>
