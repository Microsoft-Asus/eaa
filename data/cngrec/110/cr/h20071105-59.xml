  <narrative>CONGRATULATING THE PEOPLE OF ETHIOPIA -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12713]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from California (Mr. Honda) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400185" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the passage of <bill type="hr" number="550">H. Res. 550</bill>, congratulating the people of Ethiopia on the second millennium of Ethiopia. I introduced this resolution, along with my colleague and fellow member of the Congressional Ethiopian American Caucus, Congressman DONALD PAYNE.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ethiopia's calendar is based on the Orthodox Tewahedo calendar which is derived from the Julian calendar. The West follows the Gregorian calendar. On September 11 of this year, Ethiopians around the world celebrated a new millennium according to their official calendar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="550">H. Res. 550</bill> demonstrates congressional support for the Ethiopian American community, and I plan to use the attention surrounding the millennium to highlight priority issues, including political reconciliation and peace in the Horn of Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>True reconciliation includes the speedy release of political prisoners and granting members of opposition parties the right to participate in a democratic society. Peace in that part of the word will have to involve a final demarcation and implementation of the border between Eritrea and Ethiopia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the spirit of new beginnings, it is my hope that the Ethiopian Government and members of the political opposition take every necessary step toward true reconciliation. It is my hope that Eritrea and Ethiopia will come to a peaceful and fair resolution and finally be able to work together to encourage stability in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of the Congressional Ethiopian American Caucus are eager to use the millennium as an opportunity to bring national attention to Ethiopia, the original homes of hundred of thousands of Ethiopian Americans. Ethiopia is a symbol of freedom. It is a country with rich history and culture. Ethiopians made important contributions for the freedom of many African countries and fought courageously to defend its own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution pays tribute to the many sacrifices made by Ethiopians over the centuries. In the wake of a tumultuous period in Ethiopian history, it was important for me to do more to increase visibility around this country that has meant so much to an important, but largely overlooked, minority constituency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want to do more to show our appreciation to the Ethiopian American community for all that they continue to contribute to our society and, more importantly, to support their efforts to bring national attention to the issues that matter to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ethiopian Americans make up the second largest African immigrant community in the United States, with U.S.-Ethiopian relations initiated in 1903. Recognizing Ethiopia's role in the formation of a Pan-African movement and defeating colonial rule are key points in the resolution, and a significant aspect of Ethiopian identity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution also recognizes the efforts of all those who organized the millennium celebrations. The African Union has already declared the Ethiopia Millennium as the African Millennium and acknowledges the critical role Ethiopia plays in keeping peace on the continent. I thank my colleagues for passing <bill type="hr" number="550">H. Res. 550</bill>, and I look forward to the Senate vote.</paragraph>
