  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the President's new plan is a plan for more door-to-door fighting, more civil war, more civilian casualties, more troop deaths, more wasted money, more destabilization in the region and more separation from the world community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does anyone in this administration have any sense at all? They are sending our troops into the middle of a civil war, setting the stage for a wider war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President is blaming Iran for attacks on Americans in Iraq; he is vowing to disrupt Iran. He is adding an aircraft carrier to the shores of Iran. He is promising to give Patriot missiles to our friends and allies. Isn't one war enough for this President?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress needs to challenge the position of the President, take necessary steps to bring our troops home. We need to begin talks with Iran and Syria, not blame them for our misguided war in Iraq. Diplomacy is the only way to avoid a widening war. If we follow this President's path of war, we will get more war.</paragraph>
