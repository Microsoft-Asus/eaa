    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, SCLC, as it celebrates 50 years of promoting non-violent action as a means to achieve social, economic, and political justice. The opportunity to serve as the first African-American Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee is a tribute to the efforts of the SCLC to promote equal opportunity and equal justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without the courage and sacrifice of members of the SCLC, namely its first President, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and those Presidents that followed--Ralph Abernathy, Joseph Lowery, and Martin Luther King III, we simply would not be where we are today. And while we have much work to do, we are living the legacy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference everyday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This August will be the 50th anniversary of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The SCLC traces its roots to the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955, which began with the quiet yet courageous efforts of one woman: Rosa Parks. I had the privilege of working with Rosa Parks for over 20 years when she agreed to join my staff after I was elected to Congress in 1964. The Montgomery Bus Boycott brought together two local ministers, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Ralph Abernathy, who established  the Montgomery Improvement Association to lead the boycott efforts. As the movement to desegregate public transportation spread beyond Montgomery County into surrounding States, it was clear that the organization needed to expand, both in size and in scope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following the success of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a group of 60 organizers from 10 States met in Atlanta, Georgia to plan the next steps. The result was the founding of the Southern Leadership Conference on Transportation and Nonviolent Integration. The organization's title was shortened to its current name, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference during its first convention, held in Montgomery in August 1957. Next week, the SCLC will be hosting its 49th annual convention in Atlanta,  GA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leading the efforts of the SCLC to end segregation was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a man I am honored to have been able to call a friend and confidant. In fact, it was Dr. King that endorsed me for Congress when I first ran and was elected to serve in 1964. Significantly, Dr. King personally awarded me with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference  Award in 1967. Having walked alongside Dr. King, a fearless leader who challenged continued racial  segregation and believed that "oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever," I am committed to continuing the legacy of Dr. King and the SCLC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the helm of President Joseph Lowery for much of its existence--from 1977 until 1997, the SCLC advanced Dr. King's dream for an America--a society united behind the banner of equality and freedom. Today, the SCLC remains strong under the leadership of Dr. Charles Steele, Jr., promoting a number of programs in the areas of economic empowerment, health advocacy, education, and criminal justice. The SCLC has also established the Martin Luther King, Jr., Conflict Resolution Center, an international  initiative to promote Dr. King's principle of nonviolence as a means to resolving conflicts throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've come a long ways over the last 50 years, and the work of the SCLC continues to be of critical importance. It is to the credit of Dr. King and other leaders of the SCLC that today the torch of the civil rights movement is carried by many hands. One of those hands is Dr. King's son, Martin III, who headed the SCLC from 1997 until 2003 and remains committed to the organization's vision. So following the lead of Martin III, Joseph Lowery, Ralph Abernathy, and of course Dr. King, let us continue  the work and legacy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference on its 50th anniversary.</paragraph>
