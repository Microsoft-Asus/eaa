    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'd like to take a moment today to recognize Tim Culbertson and all the members of the Cheviot-Western Hills Chapter of the Military Order of the Purple Heart, Chapter 3620.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The primary mission of the Military Order of the Purple Heart is to foster an environment of goodwill and camaraderie among wounded combat veterans, to promote patriotism, and to provide service to all veterans and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tim Culbertson, a Vietnam veteran and Purple Heart recipient himself, has spent decades advocating on behalf of his fellow veterans, and his service with the Military Order of the Purple Heart makes him a great asset to our whole community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2000, Mr. Culbertson was instrumental in the establishment of Chapter 3620, and his dedication and patriotism were recognized earlier this year at the annual National Purple Heart Convention, where he was named the top Americanism Officer in the United States, an honor he truly deserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sense of spirit, patriotism and generosity exhibited by the members of Chapter 3620 reflect the dedication, enthusiasm and commitment of their Americanism Officer, Tim Culbertson. It gives me great pleasure to recognize Tim for his accomplishments, and I congratulate him on receiving this national award, and I thank him for his contributions to all the veterans of the First District of Ohio.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
