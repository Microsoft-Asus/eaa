    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I too am here to give a heartfelt thank you to Dean. You're going to hear several colleagues talk about him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I came to this institution, I came directly from the public school classroom. And the learning curve was very steep. And every step of that way, Dean was right there to help us. He is someone who understood this institution. He is someone who was willing to give his knowledge. And he was here, Mr. Speaker, for one purpose in mind: to make this country a better place. And for that I am eternally grateful. Dean has not only been a great mentor and a great resource for me here; he's turn into  a great friend. And we have talked a little bit of everything from policy to procedures, but also a lot of football too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, Dean, I thank you for all you do. You exemplify what makes this Nation great. People are willing to give up careers in private service to serve their Nation in public service, and you have done that incredibly well. I commend you for that and thank you as a friend.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
