    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 125th anniversary of the founding of the community of Hoven, SD. After 125 years, this progressive community in the Blue Blanket Valley will have a chance to reflect on its past and future, and I congratulate the people of Hoven for all that they have accomplished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dating back to the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the establishment of the Dakota Territory in 1861, and the Homestead Act of 1862, Hoven is located in Potter County of northeast South Dakota. Settled in 1883 east of Swan Lake, the enterprising prairie town boasted two general stores, a bank, a newspaper, a jewelry store, and two saloons to name only a few businesses. The grand "Cathedral of the Prairies" has graced the skyline of Hoven since its completion in the early 20th century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The quasquicentennial festivities over the Fourth of July weekend commence at twilight with a fireworks display. Additionally, the celebration will include a 5K, softball and golf tournaments, a parade, and a "Missed" Hoven Pageant, for any males desiring to compete for a pageant crown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Known today as the "little town with the big church," Hoven has grown into a credit to the State of South Dakota with its business prosperity. The people of Hoven will celebrate their achievements July 4-6. I am proud to join with the community members of Hoven in celebrating the last 125 years and looking forward to a promising future.</paragraph>
