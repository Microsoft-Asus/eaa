    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), my colleague, who is the senior member of the Democrat delegation, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend and colleague Paul Gillmor of Tiffin, Ohio. Paul Gillmor was a leader in Ohio. He was elected five times by his colleagues in the Ohio Senate as a leader and was President of the Ohio Senate three times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a leader here in this House on financial issues, focusing effectively on legislation to protect the general public. Additionally, Paul's leadership extended beyond Ohio and Congress to his position as Vice President of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His awards from grateful constituents and community groups he represented were powerful evidence of Paul's diligent efforts on behalf of those who depended on his caring representation on their behalf. Five Ohio colleges and universities honored his outstanding leadership with honorary degrees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, he served his country as a captain in the Air Force with active duty during the Vietnam conflict from 1965 to 1966. Ohio Wesleyan University and the University of Michigan Law School are proud to claim him as an alumnus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Our sympathy goes out to PAUL'S wife, Karen, and his five children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To those of us who cherished him not only as a colleague, but as a friend, we will long remember PAUL and will always be grateful that he was part of our life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400211" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would very much like to thank the dean of the Republican delegation from Ohio, Congressman Ralph Regula, a dear friend, for helping to organize this very special moment tonight in honor of our friend and colleague from Ohio, Representative Paul Gillmor, who last evening succumbed to a call that will greet us all. We never know the time nor the hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand that Paul flew back to Washington yesterday with several of his colleagues. And sometimes we wonder why things happen the way they do, but he was able to speak with several of them upon his return to Washington after having spent most of August with his family in Ohio. That itself is a gift.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with shock and sadness that we on this side of the aisle extend heartfelt sympathy to the Gillmor family. To his wife, Karen, I can't tell you how many White House Christmas parties I recall sharing with her, our travels to Mexico long before the passage of NAFTA as we evaluated the situation on the ground. Those are memories that I will hold forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the five Gillmor children, Paul was a very, very dedicated father. I recall one time I was going into Channel 11, our CBS affiliate, I'll probably get in trouble for saying this, the other affiliates won't be mentioned, even though it didn't happen in their stations, and Paul had one of his sons with him that day, and he was so polite. And we were talking about where he was going to school. Paul tried to be with his family, especially with his younger children, as  much as he could.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He suffered great tragedy in his own life, serving in Vietnam as a Captain in the Air Force in that very troubled conflict. I'm sure that he carried memories and wounds from that. And then having lost his first wife in a tragic automobile accident, having to survive that and continue to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He dedicated his life to public service. Many people I don't think realize what a wealthy man he was. He didn't have to be here in the Congress. He could have checked out long ago. But in the tradition of service that his family represented and very deep, deep roots in Buckeye land in Ohio, he served his country not just in the Air Force, but in the Ohio Senate where he was the majority leader, and finally, the people of the Fifth Congressional District in this House since 1989, a decade and  a half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many pieces of legislation for which he exhibited leadership. One of those dealt with brownfields, a problem well known in a State like Ohio, and trying to move legislation in order to convert those over for reuse. As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and Subcommittee Chair during a portion of his career, he made a real national contribution there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together, we worked on saving the 180th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the Army Air National Guard in our districts. When gerrymandering occurred a few years ago and the districts were redrawn, literally, he ended up with one half of the airport and I ended up with the other half. And I thought, oh, this is interesting. So we were very successful in our efforts there. And without question, that particular unit, which will be returning to Ohio this week, is returning to a facility that he helped  to save. One of my memories is that before their departure about four months ago, Paul and I were there together wishing every single one of the members of that unit Godspeed and a quick return to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were many times that we spent together in our region of the State. Just last week, Paul and I appeared in Findlay, Ohio as a result of the tragic 1,000-year flooding that occurred up in our area. Congressman Jim Jordan was there as well from Urbana, Ohio. And then Paul and I met with Secretary Chertoff. We were planning meetings here upon our return here this week. And we talked about the need for FEMA to be more responsive to the needs of this region. And we  then took an Apache helicopter with General Wayt from the Ohio National Guard and we flew over to Bucyrus, just the two of us together in that helicopter. And we were pointing out different reservoirs and different dams and different things that had to be done in order to prevent this type of tragedy again. And we met with the mayor of Bucyrus and with the county commissioners</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see Congressman Jordan over there. I never knew that when we were in Findlay, Ohio together, we kind of grabbed hands and tried to deal with the flooding in your district as well, that that would be the last time that we would do that together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we had many memories that we share of Paul's service. And I offer the consolation and the condolences of the people from the Ninth Congressional District, which literally wraps its arms around the northern part of Paul's district, to his family, to his friends, to his colleagues, and to say we are there in dutiful service to do what is necessary to transition in these very difficult days and months ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say personally to Karen, his wife, that I value our friendship. And many of us who have reached the age we are know what a loss this is, and we are praying for you, we are praying for your children, we are praying for your family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to extend the opportunity for our dear colleague from Tennessee, Congressman John Tanner, who is down here on the floor, who wanted to offer words on behalf of Paul Gillmor whatever time he wishes to consume. I yield him such time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400395" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you very much, Ms. Kaptur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just felt compelled to come down here. And Mr. Regula, I thank you for taking this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I guess I've traveled more with Paul Gillmor than any other Member. We have traveled together on the NATO Parliamentary Assembly business for at least the last 9 or 10 years, and that's two or three trips a year to the parliamentary meetings of NATO. And during that time, not only have my wife, Betty Ann, and his wife, Karen, become close friends, but I don't have or didn't have a closer friend in Congress than Paul Gillmor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was not only an extraordinarily talented individual who made people comfortable around him, but he also had a leadership quality that I observed up close and personal many, many times in these NATO meetings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It hasn't been all that easy the last few years. There has been unrest in the  alliance. And Paul was chairman of the Economics and Security Committee during part of that time, and I was a member and succeeded him as chairman. And it was an easy transition from the standpoint that Paul had gained so much respect from our European allies and colleagues that it was easy for us to run that committee in a way that I think was constructive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was extraordinarily dedicated to his family. He talked about them all the time. And beyond that, he was a man that had a well-grounded sense of himself. He was one who not only cared deeply for his family, his State and his country, but was willing to go out of his way and inconvenience himself time and time again to go the extra mile to try to make things better. I feel very privileged to just have known him and to be a friend of his, and more importantly, him being a friend of mine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm going to miss him a lot. I know this House will miss him a lot. The country will miss him a lot. He is currently serving as North American Vice President of NATO PA, and I'm sure that that organization will miss him as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for allowing me this time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400235" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the dean of our delegation for authoring this resolution. I also want to thank our Democratic friends from Ohio and Members from other States who I see gathering on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is no way to describe today's news about our friend, Paul Gillmor, other than shock, a devastating loss to his family, to his friends, his colleagues, Ohio and our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike a number of the other members of the Ohio delegation, I didn't come to Congress through the Ohio legislature, and so I didn't serve with Paul in the Ohio legislature, although I knew of him from Republican gatherings around the State of Ohio, he also was my mom's Congressman. She always told me the story about how excited the people were who were up in Lakeside, Marblehead and the Islands that Congressman Gillmor was going to come up and share his thoughts. But I didn't  have the chance to work with him until I arrived here about 13 years ago. What I found was what I had heard, and that was that Congressman Gillmor was a hardworking, smart legislator who loved his family, loved his friends, loved this institution and the people he served. He was willing to take the time to show a young freshman around back in 1995. He was willing to share his vast knowledge of financial services with those</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was reminded by my staff, because I want to talk about Paul's family, but I also want to talk about Paul's other family. And my staff reminded me, when they learned of Paul's passing today, that we were neighbors in the Longworth Building, and my staff told me how lucky we were to have a neighbor whose staff was always willing to walk us through another clueless day in the 104th Congress. And how you could always walk into the lobby, and how he taught us about constituent  services because you would always find a bowl of Dum Dum suckers because the Spangler Candy Company was located in Bryan, Ohio, which was in the Congressman's district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Ohio delegation is poor today with the loss of our friend, neighbor and mentor, Paul Gillmor. Our thoughts and prayers are with Paul's wife, Karen, his five wonderful children, and also, Mr. Speaker, with his Capitol Hill family, many of whom have been with him for many, many years and who miss him very badly today.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412228" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I was deeply saddened today to hear of the passing of Congressman Paul Gillmor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a freshman Member of this body, I haven't known Mr. Gillmor as long as some of my colleagues who have already spoken and who will, I'm sure, rise to speak in moments following my remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did have occasion enough to spend time with Mr. Gillmor to know what a friendly and unpretentious and likeable man he was. And my thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Karen, and his family and his friends. I did have the opportunity to serve with Karen in the State legislature in Ohio. And Karen, as I said, you're in our thoughts and prayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State of Ohio and the United States Congress have lost a great friend. Paul Gillmor devoted his life to serving his community, his State and his Nation. From his service in the United States Air Force to his tireless efforts on behalf of the people of Ohio in Congress, Paul Gillmor always fought hard to make a difference in people's lives. We will all miss him greatly. And I am grateful for the opportunity to have known him even for the short time that I did.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400334" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton), chairman of the committee on which Paul served.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, the former chairman, the ranking member now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I think of Paul Gillmor, I think of two words, "team player." Earlier this year, when the Republicans lost the majority, we had to downsize the number of Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I made a decision, as the ranking member, to try not to have to kick anybody off the committee and not bump off our junior members. So I went to the senior members of the committee and asked if there were any volunteers who might want to take a leave of absence to allow the  junior members not to have to be bumped off, and of course Paul Gillmor was one of the ones who volunteered to take a leave of absence so he could serve on the Financial Services Committee and keep his seniority on the Energy and Commerce Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Because of that, several of our junior members were able to stay on the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, about a month ago, we had a contentious mark-up coming up. Sure enough, one of the junior members had a personal family situation that they couldn't get out of. They were going to have to take a leave of absence. We needed every vote. So I went to Paul, and I said, "Would you be willing to come back on the committee for 1 or 2 days?" He kind of grumped a little bit about it, but he said, "If you need me, I'll be there." Not only did he come back on the committee, but he offered  amendments and was there all of the time and didn't complain, whine, moan or groan about how tough it was. He was a team player. He did a good job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we were in the majority, Paul was the chairman of the Subcommittee on Environment and Hazardous Materials, which is not one of the more glamorous subcommittees of this Congress. It deals with such things as the Superfund and the Clean Water Act and all these international treaties. It's a tough job. Paul did it not only with good grace, but he did it in an excellent fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Gillmor is going to be missed as a friend. He is going to be missed as a Congressman. He is going to be missed as a statesman for this country. My sympathy goes out to his wife, Karen, and his family. We will definitely miss the services of the Honorable Paul Gillmor in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless him, and God bless his family.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues here today saddened by the death of Paul Gillmor. Paul and I took much the same track to come here to Congress in that Paul served diligently for the State of Ohio in the Ohio senate. As a  matter of fact, he and his wife, Karen, both left quite a legacy there and then moved on to Congress. I knew Paul, but through other people, so to speak, until I came to  Congress. I can still remember how welcoming he was to me as another Ohio delegate and welcoming me to be here in Congress. I was very comfortable when he, Deborah Pryce and I were the Congress people hosting a banking financial seminar in Columbus not too many months ago, 4, 5 or 6 months ago. It was good to sit with Paul. We sort of chatted in between the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things that comes to mind about Paul is that he was my sister, Becky's, Congressman. She lives in Henry County in part of his district. She is a yellow dog Democrat, but she loved Paul Gillmor. Just as recently as last night, before we knew any of this had happened, we talked about him at dinner. She said, "Paul Gillmor always listens to us." So she felt very proud of her relationship with her Congressman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think many people have felt that way about Paul. When this type of thing happens, it shows you the compassion and the feeling among us, as one body, as one set of people representing America. I think that is what makes our country different from others. Paul Gillmor was certainly a perfect example of that. So my heart and my sympathy go out to his wife, Karen, and his five children. Hopefully, they will be able to continue the legacy he has set for the Gillmor family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Pryce).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400327" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we all rise in shock and great sadness to mourn the death of our friend and colleague, Paul Gillmor. There is really so much to honor about his life. He was actually a legislator's legislator. Before he came to Capitol Hill, he spent 22 years in the Ohio statehouse where he became the senate president for three terms. He was there during those formative years of his professional life so long, and to the extent of which he became a real pro at it, that he had an innate sense  of the legislative process. He got to know the people, because half of this work is getting to know the people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He seemed to come by it naturally. We would sit at whip meetings when he came to Congress. He would ask all the right questions and get to the bottom line in half the time as anyone else. Paul Gillmor really knew what he was doing, and he always made it look so effortless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He cared about other people. He cared about his staff. He cared about his colleagues. He cared about his friends. I didn't know a single soul that didn't like Paul Gillmor. And that is saying a lot in this business. Paul was a people person. He was a person that others gravitated to because he cared about them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But he cared about no one more in life than his family. As a Member who on occasion myself has missed a vote on the naming of a post office or two, I really respect the priorities that Paul Gillmor had about putting his family first. That's the right thing to do and that's the way Paul did it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has a lot for which Karen, his dear wife, and his family can be proud to look back upon as they examine the legacy that he left to Ohio, to them, and to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, we have much to honor in Paul Gillmor's life. Our prayers are with his family.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I simply cannot believe that Paul is gone. I first got to know him when we both served on a task force to rewrite the code of ethics in the nineties. That was not an easy job. Paul's performance was solid. It was thoughtful. In all the time that we discussed those issues before we brought our recommendations to the floor, I never saw him for one moment raise a partisan angle on any ethics question, and I never saw him question anyone else's motives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I did see was a man who understood that ethics is important, and yet because it involves the rules of the House, it can also be exceedingly complicated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I never saw Paul take a single cheap shot in all the time that he served on that committee. That is one of the reasons that he became one of my favorite Republicans in this place, because there are very few people on either side of the aisle who aren't willing to take a cheap shot at the other side, even if it results in damage to the institution. That's where Paul drew the line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He didn't mind seeking partisan advantage. That's what all of us try to do from time to time. But what he always tried to do, in my judgment, was to seek whatever advantage he saw without taking advantage of the institution at the same time. That's an important line to draw in an institution like this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we can all be grateful for the job that Paul did for as long as God allowed him to do it. I simply cannot believe he is gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my sincere regrets and best wishes to his family and all the members of the Ohio delegation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400406" topic="">
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen of the House, my heart goes out to Paul's wife, Karen, and his five children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Mr. Obey said, I can't believe it, either. I first met Paul Gillmor when he was president of the Ohio senate and served in the senate. He had a very distinguished career before having ever come to the United States Congress, a career that many would admire, just there in our statehouse in Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His reputation was as a man of great humility. Something that we all could learn a lesson from is Paul Gillmor's humility, the gentleness of Paul Gillmor, the way he treated people, the way he loved to serve the public of Ohio and northwest Ohio and the constituents he was so proud to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul was an Air Force veteran. Many didn't know that. He was a proud graduate of Ohio Wesleyan University in my district, and, for an Ohioan, a proud graduate of the University of Michigan's law school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul was known around the statehouse as a very gentle person, as a man who rose to the top of the political game, but never forgot where he came from, a successful politician, a successful public servant, a successful businessman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday I had the opportunity with a couple of other Members, Congressman Jordan and Congressman Hobson, to sit in the airport in Columbus in the afternoon to chat with Paul as we were coming back to Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the added opportunity to spend some time with him on the airplane sitting next to him. I will remember Paul in the way that I have always known Paul, a very happy warrior, a man who loved what he did on a daily basis. He enjoyed August, reaching out to community after community in northwest Ohio at town hall meeting after town hall meeting, up at the lake with friends and family. He enjoyed August. He had a smile on his face. He enjoyed public service. He enjoyed representing  the people of northwest Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's how I will remember Paul Gillmor. We lost a good friend. Ohio lost a native son. And America lost a patriot.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my first comments are to Karen Gillmor. Karen, I stand in your stead. Only 4 years ago, I lost my husband suddenly. All I can say to you is hold on to God's unchanging hand. He will help you through all of this. And as you think about all the wonderful memories and the wonderful opportunities and the blessing that you had to have Paul Gillmor in your life. To your sons and daughters, I say the same thing. I always talk to my son, and I say, "Merv, just remember all the  good times. Remember all the fun you had, all the things you learned, and cherish each and every one of them."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Member of Congress, I rise to speak to honor the life of my colleague and friend, Paul Gillmor. Paul and I served on the Committee on Financial Services together. When I first came to Congress, Paul reminded me of the big  bear, kind of a gentle bear. You don't even know he is really in the room until he kind of humbles into the room. I remember him saying on occasion, Stephanie, Congresswoman Jones, so forth  and so on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was pleased to have had the opportunity to cosponsor some legislation with him with regard to historic preservation. He and I both understood the importance of preserving historic buildings in this Nation and offered legislation that would have provided tax incentives for people to be able to shore up that legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike Paul, I was not in the legislature when I first came to Congress. The advantage of having a colleague and a friend who has had some experience in the legislature works greatly. I can remember one time at a Financial Services hearing, as usual, I was going at a witness. Later Paul said, "Now, Stephanie, just calm down a little bit. It ain't like you're in a courtroom anymore."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're all going to miss Paul Gillmor. The beauty of the United States Congress is that it is a bipartisan body where you have Democrats and Republicans who are there and who are able to argue or debate their particular issue. But the beauty also of a bipartisan body is that you have Democrats and Republicans who can get along, who understand the importance of raising the issues on behalf of their constituents, but also understand the importance of working together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I know everyone has already placed into the Record all of Paul's background, experience and things that he did to represent the great State of Ohio. Again, I stand here as a colleague and a friend to talk about my experiences with Paul Gillmor, to record them in my memory, and to smile, because at these times it is often hard to smile and lift up a time of laughter. But I call upon all of our friends and colleagues and his family to look to the good times, to look to  all the great memories, and, over time, time will heal some of the wounds.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the leader, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me thank the dean of our delegation for bringing this resolution to the floor, and thank my colleague from Cleveland, Mrs. Jones, for her enlightening remarks and lightening this up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was here earlier to announce Paul's passing to the House. I can remember the first time I met Paul Gillmor. I was a brand new State legislator. It was 1985, and it wasn't at the statehouse; it was down the street at the Pewter Mug.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, for those of us who served in the statehouse, we have all been to the Pewter Mug. That is where I got to know Paul Gillmor. He was the senate president; I was a lowly new house member, and Helen used to come over and wait on us. For those who came to the statehouse who went to the Pewter Mug, you would remember Helen, because you could never forget her, and she would never forget Paul.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I got to know Paul Gillmor. In 1986, Paul decided to run for Governor in a Republican primary, and I was on his team. As a matter of fact, it might have been one of the first political checks I actually wrote was to Paul Gillmor when he ran for Governor. Unfortunately, he didn't win that primary election, but I really got to know Paul Gillmor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He really was a public servant who enjoyed what he did, who enjoyed representing people, and someone that came to Congress right before I did. He came in 1988; I came in 1990. We have been close friends over the 17 years that we have worked here together. We worked on a number of issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul loved to understand what was happening around the world, and he certainly did his share of traveling to try to understand what was happening. But his work on the Energy and Commerce Committee, his work over in the Financial Services Committee will speak for itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But earlier this year, I think it was mentioned by the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Barton, earlier this year we lost our majority, we lost a number of seats, and Paul Gillmor took the magnanimous step of relinquishing his seat on the Energy and Commerce Committee to take a seat on the Financial Services Committee to help make room for other Members. It was that kind of kindness and consideration that I think all of us will remember about Paul Gillmor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Karen and the children, our prayers are with you. Paul was a great servant, a great friend, and someone who we will all miss.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, and I also thank our friend, the dean of the delegation, Mr. Regula.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would just add for a minute my thoughts and memories of Mr. Gillmor. I graduated from Bowling Green State University, so I knew of Mr. Gillmor before I even got into politics, because as many of the Members from Ohio know, he is a legend in northwest Ohio, especially in Bowling Green and especially with the Bowling Green Young Republicans. He was very familiar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember, as we all do, taking the little trolley back and forth from the office buildings over here, and for some reason our conversations always ended up talking about Ohio State football. Mr. Gillmor loved the Buckeyes. He loved going to the Ohio State football games. I remember being in the State senate seeing him at the Ohio State football games. That is just the kind of guy he was. He loved football, he loved his country, he loved his constituents, he loved this institution,  and he certainly will be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So from the citizens of the 17th District, we just want to thank Mr. Gillmor for his service and send our condolences and our prayers to his family and his children and his wife, Karen. And also to say, as Mr. Boehner, the minority leader said, he was a gentleman. He was a gentle man. In the midst of all the chaos of Washington, DC, his silence and his gentleness were very refreshing, and he will be missed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard words about Paul Gillmor, our friend, and one word we keep hearing over and over is "caring." He really cared. He cared about his family. You would go in his office and you would see the pictures of his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He cared about his staff. Mark Wellman, his chief of staff; Dave Oxner, great guys. They were sort of a reflection and extension of Paul. They were gentlemen. They really did not care about who got the credit. They were hard workers. I say to Mark and Dave, I know that you are grieving right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Obey mentioned that he cared about this institution. He truly did. He cared about every Member. I never heard him insult another Member. I never heard him say something unkind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He talked about issues. He felt strongly about issues. The brownfields legislation was a great example of how he was very tenacious, had very strong feelings. He did that earlier this year on the industrial loan companies when, as a small town banker, mainstream banker, he felt very strongly that small town banks were being disadvantaged. But he never said anything unkind about those who opposed his position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To his credit, I think part of that kindness, that caring, and also his capable leadership, that legislation passed the House 371-16. I think brownfields will be part of his legacy, particularly to the industrial States, the people of Ohio that he loved; as will the industrial loan company legislation, that really will help preserve small town mainstream banking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a banker. I had the privilege of appointing Paul as the ranking member of the Financial Institutions Subcommittee. I never regretted that decision. I knew that what Paul cared about was not himself or not the glory, but doing what was right for the American people. He never disappointed me. I will miss him deeply.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank  him for convening this resolution this evening and I thank the Ohio delegation for allowing me to be part of this remembrance of the life of our friend Paul Gillmor. Like everyone else, I was shocked and saddened this morning to hear the news about the loss of our friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard several people talk about Mr. Gillmor and his work on the committee. I remember last year in the 109th Congress when he was the subcommittee chairman and the work he did on persistent organic pollutants. It really was not something I had ever thought about before I came to Congress, it really wasn't something I ever campaigned on, but Paul had a way of explaining it and making it understandable and worked through a very complex issue working with both sides of  the committee dais to get meaningful legislation passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then at the end of the 109th Congress, after the election, coming back for the 110th Congress, and someone explained to me the arithmetic that happens when you lose the majority, and counting on my fingers the number of seats we had lost on the Energy and Commerce Committee and I was no longer going to be on that committee, and then later Paul came to me and said, "Doc, you are too important on that committee, so I am going to stay on Financial Services and I will take a leave from  Energy and Commerce."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You heard Ranking Member Barton mention it. You heard Leader Boehner mention it. I was the guy that he let stay on the committee by his selfless act of taking a leave of absence from a committee that he loved, committee work he loved to do. I thank him so much for giving me the opportunity to stay on the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, we welcomed him back a few weeks ago when we needed that extra vote when we were discussing energy legislation. And, sure enough, Paul was there not just to be a vote, but he brought amendments with him. He tied things up. He behaved just like the Paul Gillmor that I had remembered on the committee from the year before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, to his family, I wanted you to know, you had heard me mention before how selfless Paul was about giving up a place on the committee. I am the guy that he let stay on the committee. I will never forget that, and I will always try to live up to his expectations.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues from Ohio in expressing great shock and sadness at the passing of our friend and neighbor Congressman Paul Gillmor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As previous speakers have mentioned, Congressman Gillmor was in our district last week with the flooding. I had the opportunity to just visit with him yesterday, as Congressman Tiberi mentioned as well, at the airport before we flew down here. You just can't believe this has happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul was a husband and a father. He was a proud Republican, an Air Force veteran, as others mentioned, with Vietnam era service, and a long time congressional leader on international leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to his distinguished service in Congress, he made his mark in the Ohio legislature with an impressive 22-year career in the Ohio Senate, and as Congresswoman Pryce mentioned, three terms as senate president.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the unique opportunity to work with Paul on issues that affected our part of Ohio. I counted on him as a staunch ally in promoting the workers and the mission at Lima's Joint Systems Manufacturing Center, our tank plant in Lima, Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also shared in challenging times, including the tragic Bluffton University bus crash earlier this year, and more recently, as I mentioned, the flooding that took place and devastated many areas of both of our districts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I served with Paul's wife, Karen, in the general assembly, although she was on the senate side and I was on the house side, and got to know their family a little bit over the years. Our family's prayers are with her and the entire Gillmor family as they attempt to find peace in the midst of this tragedy.</paragraph>

Indeed, we truly realize the shortness of time and the greatness of eternity. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family, his friends and all of the people that he touched during the time he was on this Earth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative Gillmor was a friend. He was a gentleman who I had the pleasure of getting to know as a neighbor. Because we lived across the street from each other at one time, there were several occasions that we shared a ride home after a long night of votes. During those times, I was able to gain a small measure of the man and discovered him to be generous, kind, and, above all, considerate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Ohio were privileged to have known him as a public servant. The Members of Congress were honored to share him as a colleague. His friends were rewarded with his company, and his family was embraced by his love.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will miss Paul and remember our time with him and honor his memory. May God give Karen and his children an extra measure of grace during this most difficult time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am deeply saddened today by the news of the loss of my dear friend Paul Gillmor. PG, as many of us called him, was a shining example of service and leadership. As president of the Ohio senate, he led Ohio through good times and bad times with such grace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the last two decades, he fought for all Ohioans here in Congress, not just those in his own district. During his entire life, Paul Gillmor was a true leader, a gentleman and a statesman. Most importantly, he was a nice guy, a true friend to all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I was first elected, he became a mentor to me. I would always welcome his kind words on the House floor, "How is it going, kid?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as important, he was a great father and a loving husband.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the dean of our delegation, Ralph Regula, for bringing this resolution forward to honor the life of Paul Gillmor. We are all deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend, Paul Gillmor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to tell you one story from when I first got to Congress. Mr. Gillmor, as I referred to him, as many have said, had a gentle spirit and an informal way and a very accepting way. When I referred to him as "Mr. Gillmor," he corrected me and said, You're to call me Paul. You will hear, as almost everyone comes forward today and eulogizes him, as they honor him, they refer to him as he had us refer to him, and that is Paul.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One time we were having dinner and he was talking about some of his accomplishments. Brownfields is an area that is very important to me. When you look across Ohio and see the number of abandoned factory sites and the potential that they represent, Paul told about his work on the Brownfields Remediation Act that changed the laws that made it easier for those sites to be remediated, and provided tax benefits so that capital would be brought to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you go throughout Ohio today and see abandoned factory sites where buildings are being demolished and new buildings and businesses are being built, it is to Paul's credit and one of the things he was most proud of, that he was able to work to change the laws to help make it easier for their sites to be developed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He talked about the number of jobs that it brought, not just in construction but the jobs that it brought to communities, recognizing the impact on families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most recently, Ohio has been plagued by scandals arising from predatory  lending, and Paul was a leader in trying to help families and communities that had been subject to predatory lending, pulling together the Ohio delegation to talk about ways we can impact our neighborhoods and support laws that could impact families that had been subject to predatory lending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul will be remembered as an effective legislator, and as someone who cared deeply for Ohio and for this institution and for his country, and had an impact on the lives of Ohioans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for yielding on this very sad occasion. I am sad to join my colleagues as we face the very sad news regarding the loss of our colleague, Paul Gillmor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all Members of Congress, I rise to pay tribute to Paul Gillmor, who passed away suddenly today. I offer my deepest condolences to his wife, Karen, to his two daughters, Linda and Julie, and his three sons, Paul Michael, Connor, and Adam. How proud he was of his children. That was one thing that we used to chat about quite regularly. I would hear about the progress of the twins and how everybody was doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Paul Gillmor was an experienced and talented legislator who spent much of his life serving his country. His service began in the Air Force where he rose to the rank of captain as an Air Force Judge Advocate. As a true Ohioan, Congressman Gillmor then served his State in public office for more than four decades, first in the Ohio State senate where he was elected President of that body, and later here in the House where he also served ably and was held in highest  esteem by his colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More interested in policy than in seeking the limelight, Paul Gillmor focused his time here in the House squarely on the needs of his constituents. On the Energy and Commerce Committee, he was deeply involved in consumer issues, including protecting consumers from unfair credit report practices. He also worked to preserve our history by supporting and improving sites honoring our Nation's Presidents. As vice president of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, Congressman Gillmor was  the highest ranking American in this highly esteemed international organization of parliamentary members from the 26 NATO states.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Gillmor's passing is a loss for this House and for our Nation. It is, of course, a greater loss for his family. I hope it is a comfort to them, to Paul's family and friends, that so many people mourn their loss and are praying for them at this sad time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a sad day for us because we also learned of the sudden passing of our former colleague, Jennifer Dunn. She was a distinguished former Member of Congress from the State of Washington and I know we will acknowledge her service and leadership in the Congress on another occasion. But getting hit from all sides on this in one day is a great loss for the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I yield back to the distinguished gentlewoman, I also want to thank her for bringing to the attention of so many Members of Congress the passing of Congressman Vanik who served so ably in this body who passed away last week. Anyone who knows about international human rights knows that Congressman Vanik as part of the Jackson-Vanik amendment did so much to free people in the Soviet Union. He made a very big difference for Soviet Jewry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ohio has been generous to the country. We mourn the loss of Paul Gillmor and Jennifer Dunn and Charles Vanik, who lived until his 90s, so God blessed him with that long life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God did not give Paul Gillmor a long life, but he gave him a life of great quality with a beautiful family and the opportunity to serve a State he loved and a country that he was very patriotic about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of all of our colleagues, I extend my deepest sympathy to his family.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand with my colleagues today to honor the memory of Paul Gillmor. He was really a great guy. He actually ran the first time in 1988 for this esteemed institution, for the Congress, the same year I first ran. He won and I didn't. But in 1994 I did get to join him here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was one of the guys that, as other Members have said, he was just an all around good guy. He really was. You liked to talk to him. For some reason, he used to call me Mr. Steve; I don't know why he did that. So I started calling him Mr. Paul, and that is the way we referred to each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday evening after we had our votes, we had all come back into town from the August recess and we were asking each other what did you do over the break, what happened. He was telling me how he had stayed pretty close to home. He had worked with his constituents, been with his family for some time, and he wanted to know what I had done. I said I had done some of those same things, and that I had also had an opportunity to go to Darfur where there is probably one of the greatest human tragedies  that we have seen on Earth in a number of years, and he was very interested and wanted to know what we can do to help the people in Darfur. So we spent a period of time discussing that right outside those doors just last evening. I was just shocked when I learned that Paul had passed away suddenly so recently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was somebody that really I think made a difference in this institution. As has been mentioned, he loved his Buckeyes. He would talk about what they had done and how the game had been played and how he couldn't wait to go to the next game. And he loved our State of Ohio. He loved the people that he represented. And most especially, he loved his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are all going to miss Paul Gillmor, and we wish the best to his wife, Karen, and his five children. God bless you, Paul.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I rise to express my deep sadness to learn of the passing of one of my good friends and colleagues, PAUL GILLMOR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PAUL was the ranking member of the Financial Institutions Subcommittee that I chair, and I had the great privilege of working with him on so many important issues throughout the years. In fact, this morning at the hearing we were holding on the subprime mortgage crisis, I had reserved 4 minutes for PAUL to speak and he didn't come to the meeting. He was always punctual, and so we sent a staff member out to find him and found out the very, very sad news.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PAUL was a distinguished Representative representing Ohio for many years. He held some partisan positions as the minority deputy whip; but on Financial Services, he was always ready to reach across the aisle and to work in a bipartisan way for the safety and soundness of our financial institutions and protections of consumer concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He had a great deal of experience in banking, and in fact had run banks back in his home State of Ohio, so he brought the practical common sense of having known the business firsthand, and he always had valuable insights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just before we broke for our August work period, we had introduced a bill together on file freeze and negotiated various aspects that he thought was important for the bill. He was an outstanding person.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He served in Vietnam and he was a distinguished veteran. He served in the Air Force and achieved the status of captain. My brother served in Vietnam, and we shared conversations about that experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was an extremely outstanding leader in his home State of Ohio, and actually served in the State senate and headed the State senate for five terms before becoming elected to Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My heart goes out to his wife and children. I know I speak for many of my colleagues when I say that PAUL'S presence in this Chamber will be deeply, deeply missed. He was an outstanding patriot and outstanding Congressman and an outstanding spouse, husband and father. We are all deeply, deeply saddened.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is obviously with great sadness that we all honor the service of our colleague and friend, PAUL GILLMOR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul and I came to Congress the same year. We were in the 101st Congress and we were both veterans of the United States Air Force. He obviously expressed a great love for this Nation, for this institution, and I believe sincerely he brought credit upon all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This dedication was matched by his love for his family, his wife, Karen, his two daughters, Linda and Julie, and his three sons, Paul Michael, Connor and Adam. I express my deepest condolences to the family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the opportunity when I first met PAUL to talk informally with him about his background. He said he was a leader of the senate. Coming from the private sector and not understanding the full significance of what that meant, I became acutely aware of what it meant when I heard him in informal sessions or in meetings where he had a presence about him, an aplomb, and also a sincerity, in which he would express his ideas in a way that would get to the meat of the issue and cut to the chase.  And I realized during this, he could do it tactfully. He was not a partisan individual. He was bipartisan, in fact. I can't recollect on the floor him having a really partisan speech because I think it goes to when he was a leader of the senate, he understood to get things done,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another vignette is when he was in the Speaker's chair. I watched when there would be a huge din on the floor, and somehow his voice rose to such a crescendo and also a pitch that he could pierce this noise and bring order and stability to the House here. I used to watch him also with great admiration on how he did this. It was a tribute to his leadership and also his background as leader of the senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I come to the House floor to say his dedication and expertise will be greatly missed. He has had 40 years of public service. He established a long record of working for average Americans. God bless the Gillmor family, and God bless PAUL GILLMOR.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank my colleague for yielding the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm a first-year lawmaker here in Washington and came in with this new majority in a very partisan time in American political history, a time where too often we're preoccupied with political bickering, a time when we needed more people like PAUL GILLMOR on this floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PAUL befriended me. We, by chance, both flew out of the Columbus Airport to and from Washington, so we had a chance to sit and talk about nonlegislative matters, about our families, about some of the nonpolitical aspects of this job. And PAUL was one to give advice, despite the fact that we're on the opposite sides of the aisle. He provided me, as a good man would, with the wisdom he's obtained, and as a freshman, I was very grateful to him for his help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I didn't know PAUL before being elected to the House last November, but we share many mutual friends. Harry Mishel is a dear friend of mine, a former president of the Ohio senate, was a good friend of PAUL'S and spoke very highly of PAUL. And I think it's a testament to the kind of person he is that he would engender that kind of friendship and support, regardless of where one stands on the political aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One other small anecdote that I think sums PAUL up. A very good friend of mine worked in the Ohio caucus 20 years ago when PAUL was with the Ohio senate, and recently, this friend returned to Columbus and ran into PAUL who was there while on break here. And after 20 years, PAUL still remembered this man, not just his last name, but his first name, and greeted him as a friend after 20 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's the kind of man PAUL GILLMOR was. That's the kind of man I will remember, and my deepest and heartfelt condolences from not just me but the many good folks of Ohio's 18th District go out to PAUL and his family. He and they are in our prayers.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I remember PAUL said to me one time, he said, you know, that's my favorite meeting of the week because that's where we talk about the future, and PAUL GILLMOR was a future-oriented guy who loved his family, who loved his country, who loved the concept of public service. And he performed that public service well, whether it was years in the Ohio State senate or two decades in the U.S. Congress.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for PAUL GILLMOR. When PAUL GILLMOR was president of the senate, I lost an election and got appointed to the State senate that PAUL GILLMOR was president then for a few more weeks before we went in the minority, and he helped pick me. He picked me, and the newspaper read "Loser Wins." But PAUL GILLMOR set me on the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've never lost another election, thanks to PAUL GILLMOR. PAUL GILLMOR was always there, and I think his staff knows that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met a young man then in the State senate named Mark Wellman who was working for PAUL then. He works with PAUL to this day. That's the kind of loyalty people had to PAUL GILLMOR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know of no politician in Ohio today who doesn't have respect for PAUL GILLMOR and wasn't his friend. He transcended partisanship. He had his way about the things he had to get done, but it never became personal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we were in the legislature, both sides had great respect for PAUL GILLMOR, and we used to meet together and talk about things together. PAUL GILLMOR was a unique person in that respect because there's always somebody out there that's got it in for somebody, but they didn't have it in for PAUL GILLMOR because he was what I would call a true gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're SAEs and Ralph's an SAE, too, and PAUL went to Ohio Wesleyan, and I went to Ohio Wesleyan. We went there at the same time. But I would meet people when I got in the State senate, and they said, Do you know SKIP, SKIP GILLMOR? I said, No, I don't know SKIP GILLMOR. I know Senator GILLMOR, but he was SKIP GILLMOR to all the people at Ohio Wesleyan. And they loved him at Ohio Wesleyan, and they still do. One of the first calls I got today was from  people at Ohio Wesleyan saying what do we do. I said I don't know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've lost a good friend. I hope Karen and the children can review the statements that have been made about PAUL today. It's something that is not said about a lot of people. He was a good man, he was a great man, and he was a great father to his children, which is the most important thing, and we're going to miss him.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. I just want to say, too, that PAUL cared a lot about his staff. He was always a person that cared for others, and particularly his staff, and I want the members of his staff to know that we understand the great loss that they feel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I guess particularly when I left the Ohio senate, my staff person was inherited by PAUL, and we used to often talk about Celia Foraker, about Celia did this and Celia did that, because we both shared a great fondness for her. I know that PAUL felt that way about his staff here. It's a great loss to his staff to have a Member that had the caring concern that he did.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the people of Ohio have lost a dedicated public servant and genuine leader today with the passing of Congressman Paul Gillmor. As a colleague and friend in the House of Representatives, Paul was a strong voice for the needs and interests of the people he represented as well as a model of integrity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the almost 20 years he served as a Member of Congress and the two decades he spent in the Ohio State Senate, PAUL was also a veteran of the United States Air Force serving on active duty during Vietnam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a fellow member of the Republican Whip Team, I enjoyed sitting with PAUL at the weekly meetings where he always was perceptive and provided insight from his decades of legislative service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our thoughts and prayers are with PAUL's family during these difficult times.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400139" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Congressman Paul Gillmor and offer my sincere condolences to his family. My wife and I extend our sympathies to Paul's wife Karen and their 5 children. I know that no words can provide comfort during this difficult time or shine light on this period of darkness, but please know that Paul's family remains in my thoughts and prayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the pleasure to work closely with Paul as a Member of both the Energy and Commerce Committee and Financial Services Committee for nearly 10 years. I got to see first-hand his passion for public service, his commitment to the people of Ohio and the earnest way in which he approached his job. He truly loved representing his community and making a positive difference in their lives and the lives of all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 5th District of Ohio was well served with Paul Gillmor in office and he will be remembered dearly for his many years of public service.</paragraph>
