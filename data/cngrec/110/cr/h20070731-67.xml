  <narrative>AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H9253]</narrative>
  <narrative>That is certainly going to be true for the children's health insurance bill, which really is a huge step in the direction of Washington-controlled bureaucratic health care.</narrative>
  <narrative>So it is appropriate that we appreciate the nexus between this bill, the Agriculture appropriations bill, and that. One is the process was so flawed on the health care bill that we like to commend our colleagues on the other side of the aisle for bringing an appropriate process for appropriations bills. The other is that this is an attempt at fiscal responsibility, or at least a small step.</narrative>
  <narrative>I think it is important to appreciate what the original intent of the health insurance bill that was passed 10 years ago was, because we will not likely get that opportunity when that time arises later this week.</narrative>
  <narrative>The original attempt was to cover children who do not have health insurance between the level of income in their family from Medicaid to a low-income state, considered to be, in 1997, 200 percent of the poverty level. That is a noble purpose. It is a noble purpose to provide assistance for families who are unable to provide health insurance for their children.</narrative>
  <narrative>That legislation expires at the end of September. So we have a lot of time in order to be able to have an appropriate discussion and talk about what the changes ought to be as we move towards reauthorization. All of us believe that those children at the lower end of the economic scale ought to be able to have access to the finest health insurance.</narrative>
  <narrative>But the process, as my good friend from Tennessee mentioned, has been so remarkably flawed that that likely isn't going to be the case. In fact, we were given a bill late last week that was almost a ream of paper, 450-odd pages, that frankly doesn't include all that the majority plans to put into it because they haven't figured out how they are going to pay for it.</narrative>
  <narrative>But what they do know, they are going to cut Medicare to over $100 billion. Over $100 billion they are going to cut Medicare, which is why this bill is so important, because we have to figure out how we are going to pay for that. I know on this side of the aisle we are interested in being responsible in our spending and making certain we are able to cover programs.</narrative>
  <narrative>On the other side of the aisle, Mr. Chairman, it appears their desire is to raise taxes in order to pay for programs. In this instance, though, they are going to do what they alleged 10 years ago they ought not do, and that is to cut Medicare, cut Medicare to a huge degree so that literally millions of seniors across this Nation will see their Medicare program cut.</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition to that, there is a reported proposal on the other side that will increase taxes on every single American who has a health insurance policy. There will be a fee. They won't call it a tax; they will call it a fee to increase revenue to the Federal Government on every single American that has a health insurance policy.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Chairman, I don't know about you, but in my district, that is what we call a tax. In my district we don't believe that new programs ought to be put in place and charged with new taxes. We believe that the Federal Government ought to spend wisely.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</narrative>
  <chair> The question is on the motion to rise.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and the Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="MOTION TO RISE OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote, and pending that, I make the point of order that a quorum is not present.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Evidently a quorum is not present.</chair>
  <chair>Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, the Chair will reduce to a minimum of 5 minutes the time within which a vote by electronic device, if ordered, will be taken on the pending question following the quorum call.</chair>
  <chair>Members will record their presence by electronic device.</chair>
  <chair>The call was taken by electronic device.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400373" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400373" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, in 1997, a Republican-led Congress passed the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, a program that combines the best of public and private approaches to delivering vital health care coverage to low-income children across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today this program provides coverage to 6.6 million children and has lowered the insurance rate by nearly 25 percent. Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle decided not to include us in crafting the reauthorization of SCHIP. In addition, it included many other provisions affecting Medicare, without any input from the minority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation put forth by the Democrats has many problems, and I have serious reservations on how they propose to fund this legislation. Specifically, there are proposed funding streams in the bill passed out of the Ways and Means Committee that seek to take money out of end-stage renal disease programs by establishing policies that are shortsighted and ill-advised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As currently structured, this proposal takes funding from among the sickest patients in the Medicare program, those who have end-stage renal disease, and reallocates it to a massive SCHIP expansion. As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I was pleased to learn that Chairman Dingell was prepared to offer an amended version of the CHAMP Act that did not include any end-stage renal disease cuts, and, as indicated by CBO score sheets of Chairman Dingell's amendment, that  do not include entries for any end-stage renal disease provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was unfortunate that the bill was discharged from the Energy and Commerce before amendments could be offered to strike these cuts, but I wholeheartedly agree that we should not be making cuts to end-stage renal disease, which treats some of the sickest patients in Medicare, to fund SCHIP expansion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the CHAMP Act currently stands, my concerns with end-stage renal disease are twofold. First, the bill proposes to disrupt the market-based average sales price reimbursement system that Congress worked hard to pass in the Medicare Modernization Act. This average sales price payment system was first implemented in the physician setting in 2005 and the end-stage renal disease setting for all drugs in 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This system has been a great success across the board, and moving to reimbursement rates of ASP plus 6 percent has demonstrated significant savings. In fact, the Office of Inspector General estimated annual savings of $1 billion because of the shift from the old average wholesale price system to the ASP system in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Starting in 2006, the average sales price system includes drugs used to treat anemia in end-stage renal disease patients, as well as all other end-stage renal disease drugs. MedPACs have noted a decline in end-stage renal disease drug spending since the implementation of the average sales price, and when looking at erythropoietin stimulant agents, which are biologics used to treat anemia in end-stage renal disease, specifically it is clear that the ASP has resulted in a reduction in the price  of Medicare, which had previously paid for these biologics going from $10 under a statutory rate in 1994 to 2004.</paragraph>
  </speaking>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, a point of order.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman will state his point of order.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400030" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Isn't it true that the gentleman in the well should be addressing the underlying bill, and it's a violation of the rules if the remarks in the well do not address the underlying bill?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>If there are cuts in one bill based upon increased spending in another, is that financial connection enough to continue to proceed?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman must maintain an ongoing nexus between the pending question and any broader policy issues.</chair>
  <chair>The gentleman may proceed.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400373" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Starting in 2006, the average sales price system included drugs used to treat anemia and end-stage renal disease patients as well as other end-stage renal disease drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, there are provisions in the bill that propose to institute a statutory price control rate. It would be a mistake to change a system that has reduced prices for this medicine by 6.8 percent since the average sales price-based reimbursement system was implemented in January of 2006; 9 percent compared to what Medicare paid for the drug back in 1994 under a statutory price control rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This market-based system is working to drive down prices for Medicare in Congress, and Congress shouldn't try to fix something that's not broken. Most importantly, I also question how a cut in payment would affect patient care. A payment cut may create financial incentives to reduce or ration clinically beneficial drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dialysis providers may reduce their costs by providing fewer services and drugs, transferring patients to another setting of care, or discharging patients more quickly.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The legislation put forth by the Democrats has many problems, and I have serious reservations on how they propose to fund this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, there are proposed funding streams in the bill passed out of the Ways and Means Committee that seeks to take money out of the End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) program by establishing policies that are shortsighted and ill-advised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As currently structured, this proposal takes funding from among the sickest patients in the Medicare program, those that have ESRD, and reallocates it to a massive SCHIP expansion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Energy &amp; Commerce Committee, I was pleased to learn that Chairman Dingell was prepared to offer an amended version of the CHAMP Act that did not include any ESRD cuts as indicated by CBO score sheets of Chairman DINGELL's amendment that do not include entries for any ESRD provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was unfortunate that the bill was discharged from Energy and Commerce before amendments could be offered to strike these ESRD cuts, but I wholeheartedly agree that we should not be making cuts to the ESRD, which treats some of the sickest patients in Medicare, to fund SCHIP expansion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the CHAMP Act currently stands, my concerns with the ESRD provisions are two-fold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the bill proposes to disrupt the market based Average Sales Price (ASP) reimbursement system that Congress worked hard to pass in the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This ASP payment system was first implemented in the physician setting in 2005, and the ESRD setting for all drugs in 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This system has been a great success across the board and moving to reimbursement rates at ASP+6 percent has demonstrated significant savings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, the Office of the Inspector General estimated annual savings of $1 billion because of the shift from the old Average Wholesale Price (AWP) system to the ASP system in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Starting in 2006, the ASP system included drugs used to treat anemia in ESRD patients, as well as all other ESRD drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>MedPAC has noted a decline in ESRD drug spending since the implementation of ASP and when looking at Erythropoeitin Stimulating Agents (ESAs), which are biologics used to treat anemia, in ESRD specifically, it is clear that ASP has resulted in a reduction in the price Medicare had previously paid for these biologics--going from $10 under a statutory rate from 1994-2004 to $9.10 today for one of these ESAs--EPOGEN. This is a 9 percent drop which represents real savings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, there are provisions in the bill that propose to institute a statutory price controlled rate that would distort the market and ASP system by establishing a cap which restricts Medicare payment at a statutory rate of $8.75 or ASP+2 percent, whichever is less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be a mistake to change a system that has reduced prices for this medicine by 6.8 percent since the ASP-based reimbursement system was implemented in January 2006 and by 9 percent compared to what Medicare paid for the drug back in 1994 under a statutory price controlled rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This market-based system is working now to drive down prices for Medicare and Congress shouldn't try to fix something if it's not broken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most importantly, I also question how a cut in payment would affect I patient care. A payment cut may create financial incentives to reduce or ration clinically beneficial drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dialysis providers may reduce their costs by providing fewer services and drugs, transferring patients to another setting of care, or discharging patients more quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when we are looking for ways to save money, a reduction in reimbursement levels could actually result in unintended consequences, such as increasing the number of ESRD patients who are hospitalized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Published studies show that patients who are under dialyzed or who are suffering from anemia are more likely to be hospitalized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increases in hospitalization due to dialysis payment changes could end up being very costly to Medicare and taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is just bad policy rationale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also concerned with a provision that would move to a fully bundled dialysis composite rate--that is bundling drugs and other separately billable services into a composite rate--for large dialysis providers beginning in 2010, and for all other dialysis providers by 2013.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since passage of the MMA in 2003, CMS has tried to design and test a fully bundled payment system and has been unsuccessful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that CMS must be given more time to study this issue and complete the bundling demonstration authorized in the MMA that it has been working to implement to ensure that all of the complex factors that go into a bundled payment are accounted for and that patient care and access are not harmed under a bundled payment system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, bundling may create financial incentives to reduce or ration care resulting in worse health outcomes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An insufficient Medicare payment could cause facilities to close their doors or result in poor patient outcomes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This underscores the need to test a bundled payment through a demonstration first before implementing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress and CMS should be fully informed on how to protect patient access and quality before implementing bundling system-wide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I am committed to the reauthorization of SCHIP I cannot support these types of cuts to Medicare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the Democrats' SCHIP expansion in its current form.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400129" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the underlying amendment of the Agriculture appropriations bill, the amendment that is on the floor, strikes $50,050 from the Office of the Secretary of Agriculture, $50,050. We have now on this side accepted the amendment. The other side has used over 1 hour of procedural delay, which essentially has spent that $50,000 on the operation of the Capitol with no savings to the taxpayer; and I think that these people who get up and talk about fiscal responsibility ought to  learn a little bit of oratorical responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400178" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>I yield my time to Mr. Obey.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman from California pointed out, we have now probably expended in terms of salaries for the clerks, the cost of air conditioning for the Chamber, the cost of lights for the Chamber, we have probably now expended more money than would be saved by this $50,000 amendment; and so what I think this amendment is about is something very different than in fact we are hearing from our friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I think this is about is that, last year, if you take a look at the appropriation bills that have been considered so far this year, last year, approximately 86 hours were spent debating those bills. This year, we have had about 152 hours expended debating the same bills. Why is that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, there were 144 amendments offered by those on this side of the aisle then in the minority. This year, the now minority has offered 339 amendments. So it is obvious to me what is going on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think this debate is at all about either fiscal responsibility or the fact that the amendment purports to save $50,000. This is simply a device which allows the sponsors and the supporters to tie up the time of the House and eventually deny this House the ability to get its work done before it leaves for the August recess. That is what this is about. And all of the rhetoric to the contrary notwithstanding, I think every Member of the House knows that is what it is about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the beginning, it has been apparent that there are a small number of Members on the other side of the aisle who would prefer to engage in filibuster by amendment, no matter what that means in terms of the quality of the debate, no matter what that means in terms of the inconvenience to Members, and no matter what that means in terms of the ability of this House to finish its business in a timely fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let me simply say we will hear a lot of rhetoric tonight about fiscal responsibility. Keep in mind what the real debate is, and we will give all of that rhetoric the attention that it deserves, which is very little.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my amendment is pretty simple. As the previous speaker said, the debate that we have had ongoing here on the House  floor may cost taxpayer dollars.

That is why this amendment, which now I believe saves $100,000 from the USDA Administrative Account Budget, is worth supporting, simply because of the fact that the new SCHIP bill opens a whole  new open-ended entitlement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past, SCHIP has always been a program that was capped, that had an authorization. Now we have a program that has no income limits, that requires people to actually self-certify. If they say they are eligible, they are eligible. Anybody can get it. Warren Buffett's child could get SCHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More important to the fact is this, Mr. Chairman. The reason that it is important to save $100,000 from the USDA budget is it is going to cost a lot of money when this SCHIP bill passes and it pushes people out of private health insurance onto government health insurance. That is precisely what this will do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eighty-nine percent of the children in families with incomes between 300 percent and 400 percent of poverty and 95 percent of families above 400 percent of poverty have private health insurance. What this bill will do is push those children out of the private health insurance that their parents and their employers are paying for and make taxpayers pay for that health insurance. This is an enormous, enormous expansion of our government program, which takes choice away from patients on health insurance  and makes them take this government one-size-fits-all, bureaucratic-driven health care. And that is why we need to support removing $100,000 from the administrative budget from the USDA, because we have a long ways to go to save the money to pay for this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, as it left the Ways and Means Committee, was $76 billion over the budget in that it violated the majority's PAYGO by $76 billion. The bill that was brought to the Energy and Commerce Committee that wasn't reported out was $91 billion PAYGO noncompliant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is this, Mr. Chairman? Well, another reason why I think we need to save money by cutting $100,000 from the USDA's administrative budget is that they cut Medicare. Not just a little bit, but deeply. They raid the Medicare trust fund, and they cut and eviscerate the Medicare Advantage program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I bet every one of us has done a town hall meeting whereby we have heard constituents when we are talking about Medicare say: You know what? You people in Congress ought to give us the same health insurance that you have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, that is exactly what Medicare Advantage is. Just like we as Members of Congress have, just like we in the Federal employment health benefit, we have the ability to choose among providers who are competing against each other for our benefit. We get to choose among providers. We have choice. That is exactly what we are giving to Medicare beneficiaries with the Medicare Advantage program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These plans compete against each other for the beneficiary's business, and each Medicare beneficiary gets to choose traditional Medicare or Medicare Advantage plan, and that active choice has driven down prices and has driven up quality and customer satisfaction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill coming to the floor this week will cut 3 million people off the Medicare Advantage program. It will say to all those people who chose to have this plan that gives them comprehensive Medicare coverage: No, you have to have the one-size-fits-all government monopoly plan. You can't have this choice that looks like what Members of Congress have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why we need to cut $100,000 from the USDA budget, because all these deep Medicare cuts to pay for a massive expansion of a new entitlement program at a time when all these other programs are going bankrupt is a step in the wrong direction. That is why I urge adoption the gentleman's second-degree amendment, and I thank him for yielding me time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, a little while earlier when my amendment was introduced to cut the Office of the Secretary of Agriculture by 1 percent, $50,000, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee stood up and said, well, that is nothing. That is just pocket change, and it is a dilatory motion. It is meaningless. It is so insignificant in the big scope of things when we are talking about an $18 billion discretionary spending bill on the Agriculture appropriations bill that we  are dealing with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I thank now my colleague from North Carolina for doubling that 1 percent cut to a 2 percent cut. So now I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we are not talking about $50,000, we are talking about $100,000. And the chairman of the overall committee, Mr. Obey, is absolutely right. It is a small amount. But he is also right. I have several other amendments. He might call those pocket change as well and dilatory amendments. But the first thing you know when you add  those up, Mr. Chairman, you are going to get to over $1 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, on the floor of the House in this body inside the Beltway that may not be much money, but to the folks back in the 11th District of Georgia that I represent it becomes some significant money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, again, the chairman is right. We are trying to make a point here. And I hope not just our colleagues in the Chamber are listening, and I know they are, but I hope the American people are listening as well. Because we do want to make a point, and that is what we are doing with Mr. McHenry's amendment to double the cut to 2 percent on this small section, that is what we are doing in my base amendment with the 1 percent cut. We are saying, look, if you want to bring forth a bill, as  you intend to do later this week, the so-called CHAMP Act, to massively increase spending that violates your own new PAYGO rules by $70 billion, as the ranking member of the Budget Committee just pointed out; then if you want to find the money to have these massive expansions, then you need to look at every other spending bill and set your priorities straight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And let's say we're going to cut the money instead of doing it on the backs of our seniors. And that's why I say, you need a new acronym for this bill. It's not the CHAMP Act, Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act. No, it's the CHUMP Act, Children's Health Unfunds Medicare Protection,  and for our neediest seniors. And that's why we're here; absolutely, that's why we're here. We don't want you to do that. We don't want you to hurt the seniors,  the 3.5 million, a part of the 8 million that get their Medicare through that Advantage option, because most of those seniors, Mr. Chairman, most of those seniors are our poorest seniors. They're in that category of income from $10,000 to $20,000. And those are the people who you are pushing off the Medicare program of choice, their program of choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So anywhere we can find cuts, this amendment, the second-degree amendment, further amendments that we're going to offer, that's what we ought to do if we're going to have this massive increase in spending, which our side of the aisle feels like we should not do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we could go home in August, Mr. Chairman, and say, on Thursday or Friday of this last week that we were in session, before the long break, the Democrats have destroyed Medicare for 3.5 million low-income seniors, and they've said they've done it in the interest of providing health care for children. But which children are we talking about?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In their bill that's coming to the floor, with a closed rule, that we won't have an opportunity to amend, they want to cover children up to 400, maybe even more, the sky is the limit, 400 percent of the Federal poverty level, $82,000 a year for a family of four or maybe it's 500 percent or 600 percent. So what happens? Ninety percent of these children already have private health insurance. And so that's why we're here, and I support the second-degree amendment of the gentleman from North Carolina.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I too join in supporting this amendment, and the gentleman from North Carolina for doing it, for saving so much money for the American taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just prior to this we heard the chairman from the other side of the aisle, in essence, asking us in some ways to trample on our free speech rights in this House. And you know, when you do that, when you ask that we not speak on important issues here in this House for hours, for a period of time, and the other side of the aisle always points out that we're spending more time this year than we did in the past years trying to debate these issues. And I think the American public, quite honestly appreciates  that, whether it's 86 hours or 186 hours. I think the American public looks to Congress to make sure that we spend their money appropriately, and looks for us to debate those issues appropriately as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We, each Member of Congress, as we stand here, represents a little over 600,000 individuals, men, women and children, across this country in our respective districts. When we come to this floor and speak on this floor, we are representing their voices. We bring their voices from New Jersey to this floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so when the other side of the aisle says, oh, you go on too long over there in the minority, well they're saying that really to my constituents. They are complaining that my constituents' voice should be silenced. And I come to the floor right now and say, no, sir, my constituents voices will not be silenced. I will speak out when I can, where I can on behalf of the constituents of the Fifth District and the State of New Jersey as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I know that we're looking at a bill here with $18.6 billion. Right now we're looking at an amendment for $100,000. To us, and my constituents, that's a lot of money. And if it takes us an hour or two hours to debate this one amendment, to get consensus to save $100,000, well, that's a lot of money to my constituents, and they would say that hour or two hours of debate is well worth it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, maybe the other side of the aisle will disagree with me. Maybe the other side of the aisle doesn't care whether we spend 50,000, 100,000 of our hard-earned tax dollars. And maybe they will accept the amendment as they did in the past, and if they do so, the $100,000 amendment, we appreciate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But you know, in that regard, this really is a bipartisan effort then. It is really two parties coming together to solve a problem. The one party, the majority party, comes to this floor, raises our taxes, increases our spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The minority party, the Republicans, equally come to the floor, and we reach out our hand and work together. While the Democrats raise our taxes and raise the spending, we reach out a hand and say how about trying to bring that spending down just a little bit by $100,000, and by bipartisan effort we're able to get that down. So this is a bipartisan day, and I hope that we will see other amendments to increase that bipartisanship as well, as we try to rein in the spending that the other side has  brought us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And when we talk about what the other side has brought us, and one of the reasons why we need to save this $100,000, just think of what we've gone through in the last few months already and just recently in the last couple weeks. We have seen taxpayers on the American taxpayers go up by over $400 billion in one of the first bills that House passed under the majority party of their budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen just recently them raising taxes again through the farm bill. And now with this underlying bill that we'll be looking at in a little bit on the SCHIP bill, another $60 billion in taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me add just one more tax increase that maybe Members of both sides of the aisle may be forgetting about. Just a few hours ago, as I look at the clock, I came out of Financial Services Committee, where we, or the majority party, added the last piece to the puzzle with regard to another tax increase on the American public, and that's the MTI. That's the mortgage tax increase. That's a tax increase on every family in America who needs to go out and get a mortgage to buy their first home  or their second or an additional home as they move into it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every family in America who will want to get out a mortgage in the future will now have to pay an MTI, a mortgage tax increase, thanks to the majority party in the legislation that is just finally put in place. So whether it is an increase in the budget taxes or the farm bill or the SCHIP or now an MTI as far as a tax increase as well, we're working with the other side of the aisle. As they raise taxes on the American family, we work with them here and there, to bring down the spending to a level  that our taxpayers in our districts are able to abide by.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words in support of the McHenry amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to rise in support of the McHenry amendment. And I want to compliment the subcommittee chairwoman, Ms. DeLauro, for her openness and bipartisanship in preparing the ag appropriation bill and working with Ranking Member Kingston.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I asked Mr. Kingston, I said, have y'all held hearings on the bill? He said, yes, we held lots of hearings. I said, did you prepare a draft that was circulated in a timely fashion? He said, yes, we prepared a draft, circulated in a timely fashion. I said, was there an open markup where Members could offer amendments on both sides of the aisle? And he said, yes, there was an open markup. So I want to compliment you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I want to contrast that to the SCHIP bill. We've had one hearing in the Energy and Commerce Committee in which SCHIP was the focus of Mr. Pallone's subcommittee. The bill came over the transom last Tuesday night at 11:36 p.m. The markup was scheduled, I believe, at 10 a.m. the next morning. Chairman Dingell did delay that until 4 o'clock the next afternoon, and then again delayed the actual markup after opening statements a little bit further.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We didn't have any witnesses testify. We didn't have any open process. We didn't have a circulation of a draft. We got a 465-page bill at 11:36 last Tuesday evening. So that's, I mean, I'm in awe of Ms. DeLauro and the way she's operated her subcommittee, and Mr. Obey and the way he's operating the full appropriations committee, actually using the process. We're not doing that in the Energy and Commerce Committee or the Ways and Means Committee on the SCHIP bill.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H9259]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I'm told, I don't know this for a fact.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>Sure, I'll yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>The gentleman has complimented me for the way we have handled appropriations bills.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>And that's a sincere compliment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the compliment. But let me suggest that I would appreciate it, if we have conducted ourselves the way the gentleman thinks we should, then I would appreciate that he would not visit his frustrations on other legislation on the appropriations process when we have produced bills in what you readily admit is the correct fashion. If you have an argument in your own bailiwick, it would be nice if you kept it there so that the House might get its work done.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate that gentleman's comment. But my response to the distinguished chairman of the full Appropriations Committee is, you've got to pick up your buckets where you stand. And this is our only forum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm told that the Rules Committee is going to meet at midnight or 1 a.m. this morning to consider a same-day rule for SCHIP. Now, keep in mind, last Tuesday night at 11:36 p.m., after the House is through with its last vote of the day, we get a 465-page SCHIP bill that hasn't had any hearings on it, that hasn't had any witnesses on, that hasn't had a draft circulated. And now the Rules Committee is going to meet at midnight allegedly, or 1 o'clock this morning, to consider a same-day rule to  consider that bill tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I respect Mr. Obey and I respect Subcommittee Chairman DeLauro for doing the process the right way. But our only recourse, unfortunately, under the rules is to come out on this floor under the open rule to strike the requisite number of words to speak on the ag appropriation bill and then talk about the travesty that may be hoisted on the American public tomorrow in which a $227 billion cut in Medicare over the next 10 years is going to be voted on, with not one witness testifying  in favor or opposition, not one draft that's been circulated, not any process at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I support the McHenry amendment, and I also support an open process on the largest health care issue that's going to be before this Congress this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should not have the Rules Committee vote tonight at midnight to bring a same-day rule. We ought to send the SCHIP bills back to the committee, have a normal process, and then bring them to the floor later this fall where we could have an open debate in the full House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400089" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I also rise in support of Mr. McHenry's amendment, but I also want to thank my ranking member, the subcommittee chairman here. I serve on the Appropriations Committee, and Chairman Obey is correct: the committee has done a good job of making sure we had bills in front of us and opportunity for debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I also want to reiterate Mr. Barton's point. He is absolutely right. The reason we're out here today and having this discussion is because we, each one of us, as Members of Congress have really a fiduciary, very deep and profound fiduciary responsibility to be good stewards of the taxpayers' dollars. And we're here debating an appropriations bill on how to spend those tax dollars. And the Agriculture Department has, an important part of its role is the taking, they have a role directly,  for example, in the Texas Medical Center. And the nexus to this debate, Mr. Chairman, that I would certainly point out is, under this bill, the Department of Agriculture, for example, helps maintain the children's nutrition program at the Baylor College of Medicine, which I'm proud to represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Agriculture Department, a key part of their responsibility is children's health. And it is highly relevant to talk about this Children's Health Insurance Program that the Democrat majority is attempting to shove through this Congress with very little debate, very little sunlight, which is always a dangerous sign. If they won't let you read the bill and they won't let you talk about it, it is sure going to contain serious problems. And I for one am deeply concerned about the tremendous expansion  this bill proposes. The bill will, it is clear from what we have seen, take seniors off of Medicare and allow States to put illegal aliens on Medicare. The bill has no reasonable limits. The bill has no enforceable limits on age. The bill has no enforceable</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, imagine what that means in the State of California where the Governor has already advocated and the legislature has advocated providing health care coverage to illegal aliens. And I say that in the context, ladies and gentlemen, of the fact that all of us need to remember, every bill, every dollar we spend, that the Government Accountability Office has already calculated that in order to pay for the obligations of the Federal Government today, my overriding concern is that, in order to pay  for the existing obligations of the Federal Government, the GAO has calculated, Mr. Farr, that each American would have to buy $155,000 worth of Treasury bills. That's how massive the existing obligations of the Federal Government are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The existing obligations of the Federal Government are so massive that every living American would have to purchase $155,000 worth of Treasury bills, and that wouldn't even touch the national debt. That wouldn't even touch the interest on the national debt. And yet the Democrat majority has attempted to jam through a bill here that we don't even really know the ultimate cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Barton estimates that if the States expand coverage as far as they could to pick up illegal aliens and people of any age group or income group, but if Mr. Barton is correct, and I think it is reasonable that there is no real way to calculate how much this bill costs, we are adding a monstrous and inexcusable financial debt on the back backs of our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You are taking away Medicare coverage from seniors and allowing States to give it to illegal aliens. This is outrageous, it is unacceptable, it is unaffordable, and you are going to break the back of the taxpayers of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I, for one, will stand at this microphone and all of us have an obligation to stand up here like Horatio at the gates of Rome. If this is the only place that I can stand and fight, I will stand and fight here as long as it takes to protect the Treasury and the taxpayers of this country from irresponsible, irresolute spendthrift practices of the majority of this House, and I won't stand for it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise with considerable regret, and I want to speak with affection and respect for my good friend and colleague from Texas (Mr. Barton), the senior member of the Republicans on the Committee on Energy and Commerce. He complained about the process in the Committee on Energy and Commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like the House and this committee to know that he was afforded, first of all, every bit of notice that is required by the rules of the House, that the proceedings which were conducted in that committee were conducted in an eminently fair and proper way in full accord with the rules and the proprieties of the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like him to know that I am sure he can recall that we sought his counsel as to how it was we could put something together which, in fact, would give him a process which would enable us to address the problem of SCHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to remind him and this committee that SCHIP is going to expire on the 30th of September. That is an important date because at which time we are going to find that all of  the kids, 6 million of them, who have coverage under SCHIP will lose that coverage if something is not done by the Congress of the United States. It is our purpose, given the fact that there will be a recess in this body during the month of August, to see to it that we have  this measure ready for the floor in time that the business can be dealt with and that we can handle the matter in a way which will take care of these kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation was made available to my good friend and to my Republican colleagues on the committee as soon as it could be done after the necessary discussions were held to try to frame a proper piece of legislation and to address something that responsibility of a fiscal and financial character requires, and that is to deal with the pay-fors and how we will pay for the cost of this program. We have done so, and we have arranged that the payments will be a little different than the Senate bill,  but they will be sensible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, we will require that the Medicare Advantage plans pay their fair share but that they are not overpaid for the services which they are providing. Some of the less fortunate are getting 11 percent more than they are entitled to, some of the more fortunate are getting 19 percent more than they are entitled to, and some of the most fortunate are getting 30 percent more than they are entitled to. It seemed like good sense to put them in a position where they could compete honestly with  the other Medicare providers, and that is what we have done. We also have a modest increase in the tobacco tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are all issues which will be considered; and we offered my good friend and my Republican colleagues a chance to amend, debate, and to discuss this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would note for the benefit of my good friend from Texas that the rules do not require hearings and that on a number of occasions on important legislation in prior Congresses during his chairmanship and that of others of my very dear friends on the Republican side, the situation was conducted in a way in which there were no hearings and which legislation was brought directly to the committee and shot to the House floor in considerable haste. We protested this, but I have to say that, given the  exigencies of the situation, the needs and the circumstances and the fact that the kids are very liable to lose their health care benefits and their insurance under SCHIP, we saw fit to bring the matter up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House will, I hope and I think and I am informed, have this measure before us in the next little bit. We will do so with a full opportunity of everybody to debate it, to discuss where the money is coming from, what the benefits will be, and whether or not the legislation should be passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my personal feeling that we have a chance here to not only save some 6 million kids who would lose all benefits, but under the legislation which has come out of the Ways and Means Committee and which was considered in the Committee on Energy and Commerce to cover not 6 million but 11 million kids that desperately need this, which will be important.</paragraph>

I also believe that we should use as close an approximation of an open and fair process on the SCHIP reauthorization as we are using on the pending appropriations process; and I am informed by my staff that the SCHIP bill, which was 465 pages in length, was presented to minority staff at 11:36 p.m. last Tuesday evening; and I would like the distinguished chairman of the full Energy and Commerce Committee to indicate  to me if that is a true statement.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I do want to speak in favor of the McHenry amendment. I think it is a vitally important amendment that we debate on this House floor today. Maybe the dollar amount is modest; the principle is huge. This is a body that spends too much of the people's money, and it has repercussions. And no matter how intensely our friends from the other side of the aisle want to prevent us from painting a picture for the American people on where their spending is leading, we feel  compelled to speak out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, already this body is spending over $23,000 per American household. In real terms, it's one of the greatest amounts since World War II. Every appropriations bill that has come to the floor, practically every single one is spending more money than last year, way beyond the rate of inflation and beyond the ability of the family budget to pay for the excess in the Federal budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, now we have an Agriculture appropriations bill which is almost 6 percent above last year. I assure you, the American people didn't get a 6 percent raise, those who are expected to pay for it. And beyond the 6 percent increase, the bill expands mandatory spending. Now, supposedly PAYGO is supposed to apply to this, but it doesn't because we have a PAYGO loophole. And this is a big, big loophole, Mr. Chairman. And we need to pay attention to more mandatory spending. Because already, simply  with the government that we have today, before our friends on the other side of the aisle add on a massive increase in an SCHIP program that's going to be funded with tax increases and Medicare cuts, before they do that, we're already on automatic pilot to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And don't take my word for it, Madam Chair, take the word of the Office of Management and Budget, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the conservative Heritage Foundation, the liberal Brookings Institute. So there is this train wreck coming on entitlement spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a modest amendment that would reduce a little bit of spending in the Agriculture bill to take off that pressure, and instead the amendment is simply mocked. Well, we can't do that because we know if we don't pass this amendment, this modest amendment, to save money on the Agriculture appropriations bill, we know what it's leading to on SCHIP, a new permanent entitlement of almost $160 billion over 10 years. I mean, Madam Chair, this is unconscionable, unconscionable on top of the burden  that is already going to be placed upon future taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we have so many Members who come to the floor and talk about, well, we have to be here for the least of these. Well, Madam Chair, I would posit that maybe the least of these are those who do not vote and those who have yet to be born. And so that is why we need the amendment passed by the gentleman from North Carolina to save this money, to take pressure off of creating this new huge permanent entitlement in SCHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also need this amendment in this Ag bill to take the pressure off this huge cut in Medicare that the Democrat majority is now planning, as they seek to pit grandparents against their grandchildren in this massive SCHIP tax-spend-debt spiral. I mean, they're going to increase taxes, the tobacco taxes. I'm not a smoker. I used to be a volunteer in the American Cancer Society, but last I looked, it's still a legal activity. So taxes are going to fall on low- and moderate-income Americans as they  seek to take away private insurance from others and put them onto a public insurance plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're looking again at cutting Medicare Advantage plans, almost 20 percent of the people. We're going to have pressure to cut Medicare.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I also rise in support of the McHenry amendment. Clearly, we have to get some control over spending, and this Agriculture bill is no exception to this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we look at this spending bill, as we've looked at the rest of them, we're continuing to spend more money, and it's a recipe for further tax increases. Furthermore, it's going to be at the expense of seniors. Here we are, we're looking at an SCHIP bill which, in my opinion, after looking at this to the extent I've been able to look at it, appears to be very irresponsibly crafted.

    <paragraph>Looking at what we're going to go forward with as we look at health care, how are we going to pay for health care if we're putting all this money into overspending in these other bills? We have to get our priorities straight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we're going to raise cigarette taxes, a diminishing source of revenue, to pay for a program that's expanding, and then we're also going to take one-time money from Medicare Advantage to pay for an expanded program, how is it that we're going to deal with our entire Federal budget?

    <paragraph>Madam Chair, reclaiming my time, I just want to say that we're talking about an Agriculture bill, a spending bill, and we're talking about money that is going to be spent. We're talking about money that is going to be spent in this that will not be available to spend on health care issues, particularly on a number of issues affecting rural seniors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I have a rural district, it depends on agriculture, and as we go forward, we're going to hurt these seniors in these rural communities. If we cut over $200 billion in Medicare spending, I have 3,246 seniors in the Seventh Congressional District who are currently enrolled in the Medicare Advantage who are going to suffer. So I think we have to get our priorities straight as we go forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, as we look at payments for hospitals are being cut $2.7 billion; in-patient rehabilitative services, $6.6 billion in cuts; payments for skilled nursing facilities, $6.5 billion in cuts; payments for certain drugs, $1.9 billion; in-State renal disease, $3.6 billion. These are seniors who are poor in my Seventh Congressional District, and because of the spending in this Agriculture bill, they can't take care of these problems.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I appreciate very much the recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I think that the American people are probably getting a pretty good lesson on the effectiveness, or lack of effectiveness, of this Congress right now. Unfortunately for the institution, the lesson is driving home the poll numbers that show how little regard the American people have for the majority party right now. It is important that we have the opportunity to debate every one of these bills and that we have the opportunity to debate the amendments that are here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the amendment that my colleague from North Carolina has offered. I think, again, that it is important that we do that. It is also important that we have the ability to tie the amendments that are being offered to this agriculture bill to other issues. The majority party may not want to do that. However, it is very important that we do that, because these appropriations bills are all tied together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, there was a great hue and cry from the majority party about how much money was being spent by the Republicans, what profligate spenders we were. Now that the Democrats are proposing spending all this money, it is negligible. $10 million is negligible. $5 million is negligible. It is insignificant. All kinds of words like that are being used.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Every spending bill in this Chamber is connected to every other spending bill, so how can you possibly say that they are not the same? You passed this huge budget with the largest tax increase in the history of this country. The budget sets the spending. I cannot understand why we can't talk about the budget and every other spending bill that we are going to deal with in conjunction with this spending bill, because they are all tied together.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Well, I will say again that we passed one budget in this House that includes the money for all the spending bills. If there is one budget, then it would seem to me that all of the spending bills are tied to each other. Therefore, any spending bill has a connection to every other spending bill. So there is a nexus there, and talking about what is going to happen or what is being proposed in one spending bill is relevant to every other spending bill. I simply don't see how you can separate  them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is going to be especially clear to the American people that that is the case when an omnibus spending bill is brought here this fall and we are asked to vote for, again, the largest tax increase in the history of this country within the confines of a very, very large spending bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today on the McHenry amendment, which would cut $100,000 from the USDA, the Department of Agriculture. $100,000, that is the equivalent to what the out-of-pocket costs will be if you have a 10 percent cut in Medicare Advantage for poor health seniors in my State.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Certainly, if the Medicare Advantage plans are whacked in a rural district, then perhaps seniors may want to take advantage of that provision. I don't know. Because drug reimportation poses a whole set of different issues that can be problematic, if you have seen some of the polluted drugs coming in from China right now.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Madam Chairman. I will try and confine my remarks more to the McHenry amendment, which, as we know, would cut $100,000 out of the Department of Agriculture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, that $100,000 may not seem like a lot to many on this floor, but it may seem like a lot to a senior if they are going to lose their Medicare Advantage plan. But I know that is not the issue before us at this moment. The issue really is, how do you control spending in the Federal government?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think one of the ways you control spending in the Federal government is through the McHenry amendment. Because the McHenry amendment reduces Federal spending by $100,000, which may not seem like a lot to some and they may not want us to talk about how it could be used in other programs that may come before this House at a different time in a different way. But certainly, if you were going to lose your Medicare, you would be concerned about you might save $100,000 here that could be used somewhere  else so you did not have to raise taxes on, say, health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Saving $100,000 here is a good thing. It may not seem like a lot, but it is still a good thing. It reduces spending, and this government has had trouble reducing spending. We have spent a lot of time on this floor debating amounts that are even less than $100,000. I would like to see us go farther than that, because I also know in other committees there is debate going on about having to raise revenues to fund other programs.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you. I would rather cut the Secretary's budget by $101 billion as a way to save money than to cut the Medicare Advantage program because the Medicare Advantage program helps millions of Americans and thousands in my own congressional district. So as the Democrats propose to cut that program in their SCHIP bill, I believe it would be better to cut this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the McHenry amendment to cut $101,000 from the Secretary's budget because the Medicare Advantage bill will cut 3 million seniors' ability to collect their benefits through Medicare Advantage.

I don't favor cutting the funding for end-stage renal disease programs. I would much rather cut the Department of Agriculture administrative budget than do as the Democrats would in their SCHIP bill, cut $3.6 billion from the  end-stage renal disease program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems to me that the amendment of the gentleman from North Carolina to cut $100,000 from the administrative budget of the Secretary is a much-preferable method to achieve the savings that we need. In each of these instances, I believe that cutting the Secretary's budget would make much more sense than cutting the Medicare program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have constituents in my district who would much rather see us cut the Ag budget than see us cut Medicare or see us cut end-stage renal disease or than see us cut oxygen therapy as is all done in the Democrats' SCHIP bill.

  <narrative>Mr. PETRI changed his vote from "aye" to "no."</narrative>
  <narrative>Ms. KILPATRICK changed her vote from "no" to "aye."</narrative>
  <narrative>So the decision of the Chair stands as the judgment of the Committee.</narrative>
  <narrative>The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400368" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400368" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>As I understand the ruling of the Chair, it is appropriate for me to say I support the gentleman's amendment because I do not support cuts in skilled nursing facilities or cuts in rehabilitation facilities or cuts in long-term care hospitals or cuts in oxygen, or cuts in brachytherapy, or cuts in end-stage renal disease or cuts in Medicare Advantage; but that I cannot say which appear in their SCHIP bill. Is that correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> It is permissible to identify as preferable an alternative object for funding. It is not permissible to dwell on the merits of that alternative object.</chair>
  <chair>The gentleman may proceed.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400368" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>I thank you very much for your ruling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I do rise in support of the gentleman's amendment. I believe that we have to find the funding necessary for essential government programs and that cutting the Secretary of Agriculture is much better than cutting such programs as skilled nursing facilities, rehabilitation facilities, long-term care hospitals, oxygen under Medicare, brachytherapy under Medicare, end-stage renal disease funding under Medicare or Medicare Advantage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those reasons, I rise in strong support of the gentleman's amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I move that the Committee do now rise.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion to rise.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="MOTION TO RISE OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>A recorded vote was ordered.</narrative>

  <narrative>Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina and Mr. PEARCE changed their vote from "aye" to "no."</narrative>
  <narrative>So the motion to rise was agreed to.</narrative>
  <narrative>The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.</narrative>
  <narrative>PERSONAL EXPLANATION&lt;ul&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400193" topic="NOT VOTING--49">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I was absent from the House floor during today's vote on <bill type="h" number="2831">H.R. 2831</bill>, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007, which will protect women against pay discrimination and restore all employee's rights regarding nondiscriminatory pay. The legislation will reverse the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Ledbetter v. Goodyear by putting into statute widely accepted rules in employment discrimination law. I strongly support federal protections against pay discrimination; therefore,  had I been present, I would have voted for <bill type="h" number="2831">H.R. 2831</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Tierney) having assumed the chair, Mrs. Tauscher, Acting Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (<bill type="h" number="3161">H.R. 3161</bill>) making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.</paragraph>
