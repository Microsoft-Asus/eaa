  <chair>Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill (<bill type="h" number="3043">H.R. 3043</bill>) making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes, with Mrs. Tauscher in the chair.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, as we begin this debate today, I think I ought to take just a moment to explain to the Members of the House where we stand. We have, I believe, 19 amendments still pending to this bill. Four of those amendments will take at least one-half hour and perhaps significantly longer. When you add the slippage time to those debate minutes, if every Member exercises his or her right to offer the amendments that are filed, we could be here for another 8 hours on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know Members are trying to catch their planes. I will try to keep my remarks as brief as possible; I would appreciate it if everyone else would do the same. And if there are those Members who could be persuaded to forgo offering an amendment or two, that would be helpful also in terms of any Members who are trying to catch planes. I think that by now we are well aware of what people's philosophical ideas are about this bill, and I would appreciate it if Members could extend enough courtesy  to their colleagues so that our colleagues, especially those on the west coast, will be able to make their planes without staying in town overnight.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I certainly would like to echo his sentiments regarding the time available to us to complete the bill and the ability of Members to get home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just offer a modest proposal. There is a unanimous consent request, but I just ask that the authors consider the possibility that there are four across-the-board cuts proposed for the bill different percentage amounts and there is 2 hours allocated for that debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seemingly, 1 hour's worth of debate to determine whether or not there was a majority of votes in the Chamber to cut this bill across the board by 0.25 percent or 4.6 percent, seemingly 1 hour would be enough time to debate as opposed to 2. So that decision has been made, but as the chairman suggested, people may think differently as we move on through the debate about the possibility of spending less time debating those same issues.</paragraph>

  <narrative>Amendment offered by Mr. Westmoreland:</narrative>
  <narrative> At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following:</narrative>
  <narrative> Sec. __. None of the funds made available under this Act may be used by the Department of Education to publish or process the Free Application for Federal Student Aid in a language other than English.</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the order of the House of Wednesday, July 18, 2007, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, when a student decides to go to college, many families gather all their financial records and sit down to fill out the free application for Federal Student Aid, or the FISA, form.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To be eligible to receive Federal student aid, a student must meet certain eligibility requirements. Importantly, one of those requirements is that the student be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen, basically, a legal permanent resident. They also have to have a high school diploma or a GED and be enrolled or accepted at a school that participates in the Federal Student Loan Aid program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given these requirements, it would be expected that a citizen or legal permanent resident that is a high school graduate or GED holder and has been accepted as a student at an institution of higher education would be able to complete the FISA in English; however, the U.S. Department of Education clearly does not think so. I have a higher opinion of our education system than that, and I believe a student that meets these eligibility requirements will be proficient enough in English to complete  this form in English.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I learned that this free Federal student application form is available for completion in either English or Spanish, I became concerned that others don't share my opinion of the capabilities of our education system. Even more disturbing is the presumption that the Federal Government would be subsidizing the college education of an individual that does not have the proficiency in English to fill out the form to get free Federal assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, colleagues, my amendment is simple. It would prevent the Department of Education from providing or  processing the free application for student loan assistance form in any language other than English. With the requirements for obtaining student assistance, it is not an imposition to ensure that our tax dollars go to students that are clearly ready to receive and achieve a college education. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I wonder how any of us would like to have our future decided by people we have never met or never even seen on the basis of those people having a 10-minute conversation without our being present. I don't think any of us would like that very much, and yet that is what the gentleman is asking us to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman, in effect, is asking us to pass sentence on 150,000 students who applied for student financial assistance last year using the Spanish version of the application form. Those students would automatically be denied financial aid, with no demonstrable proof that they were illegal aliens, only because they felt more comfortable applying in Spanish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I want every American--I want every person who comes to this country to learn English. I hope our values are the cement that holds this country together, but I think that English is a great tool to strengthen that cement. But I really would simply suggest that, first of all, this is the wrong venue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Appropriations Committee has held no hearings on this matter. So far as I know, the gentleman has held no hearings on this matter. He may have very strong opinions; I do, too. But both of our opinions may be irrelevant when we discover what the facts are. The fact is, if something like this is going to happen, if we are going to make decisions that affect people's career possibilities just for the heck of it, it would be nice if we had thought about it rather than jumped onto the nearest  slogan masquerading as an amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would strongly urge that this House show a sense of fairness and a sense of restraint and decline to support the gentleman's amendment, at least until we have had hearings in the proper committee. That is the way we would do things if we are concerned with due process, if we are concerned with maximizing fairness rather than scoring political points.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I seek the time in opposition.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would hope that all of our colleagues would oppose this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The student loan application that is in question here, the criticism of it and the concern with it is not because it is printed in Spanish or English. The real criticism is that it is so complicated that families have an incredibly difficult time in filling out this form. Our committee has been working, Mr. Emanuel and others have been working, to try to simplify this form to make it useful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This form has more questions than if you went to the World Bank to get a loan. But to now suggest that a student may be denied access to a loan and the family may be denied access to financial support for that education solely on the basis of whether or not the parents speak English, they fill out the form right and whether or not the form is printed in Spanish, you know the old saying, I'm here from the Federal Government; I'm here to help you. This has nothing to do with the parents' status.  Nothing to do with the status. It is a question of whether or not we make some effort to reach out to these individuals to make it easier for them to fill out the forms that are necessary for their young people, their children to go on to college and have the financial resources to do that. The question of whether it's printed in Spanish or not is simply now</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we know about people trying to learn English is that in every city, in every part of this country, where there are classes to teach English, they're oversubscribed, they have waiting lists because these people understand that English is the language of this country. It's the currency of the country, it's the means by which you get ahead in this country, and that's why they want their children to learn English. To now come along and say that we're going to make it more difficult, based upon  this characteristic that has nothing to do with your qualifications for the financial assistance, with the qualifications of your child to go to school, what they've accomplished with their lives, I think is outrageous and arbitrary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd like to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Honda).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400185" topic="">
    <paragraph>As an educator and a classroom teacher and as a principal of a public school, working with youngsters who come from different language background, I find the amendment quite counterproductive and a barrier. Many parents feel embarrassed that they can't help their youngsters, and this would only enhance that. If in our system that we're looking to encourage children to go to school and pursue higher education, this would be but a barrier. And I'm sure that you don't want youngsters  to be not going to public education system and applying for these kinds of assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a thought though. And we have Fortune 500 companies in this country. And I just bought a phone. And in the instruction manuals, the instructions are not only in English but it's also in Spanish, French and German. There must be a reason why Fortune 500s do this. It's about customer satisfaction. And if this government is about satisfying those who are here in this country, who are citizens, who are taxpayers then we should be also looking at this kind of mentality.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="">
    <paragraph>I think the gentleman makes a point. This is about American citizens who are here who are paying taxes, whose children have done well enough to go on to college. They're seeking the financial resources to do that. They may not speak English. And this is a service that we provide to those individuals so that they can accurately fill out a form. They can understand the form, they can understand the liabilities that they're taking on. They can understand the qualifications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To arbitrarily come along and tell one group of citizens, based upon this question of whether or not they speak English, they will be able to have the same access to these resources as others or not seems to me to be very unfair, very un-American. It promotes a set of values that really aren't consistent with the values in this country. And it really is about whether or not the Federal Government is in the business of looking at the people they're trying to serve as customers, people who should  be served.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would hope that we would oppose this amendment. We continue to struggle to try to make this form comprehensible to those who speak English and understand English. And I think to make it more difficult now for those who don't is a very poor service to that part of American society. And I would urge opposition to this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, I wondered how the other side would answer to this, and quite interesting answers. First of all, this doesn't have anything to do with K-12. And as far as you buying your phone, Mr. Chairman, as far as somebody buying a phone that's got instructions in three or four different languages, they may be sold in different countries. I don't have any idea. But the Federal Government didn't buy that phone for you to use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, here's the thing. We're talking about student aid, free aid going to someone who is fixing to go to college that is a legal resident here, either a citizen or a legal resident. All we're  saying is if you're going to ask the American taxpayers to pay for your financial assistance, that you should be proficient enough in the language of this country to fill out the application. Now, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure that out. And we  can throw all these other little things in there about the people that won't get to apply and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It doesn't matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All this amendment says is if you're going to ask the Federal Government to help with financial aid for your college education that we hope you succeed in, and that we want you to excel in, that you can at least speak the language of this country. That's all we're saying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very simple amendment. There's been so much rhetoric over there. I guess, you know, evidently, they're taking this for something that it's not. Very simple, Mr. Chairman. Very, very simple. Do we want to make sure that our taxpayers' dollars go to students who are legal citizens of this country, who have a GED or a high school education, that are applying for financial aid to go to a college in this country to be proficient enough in English to fill the application out in English? It's  very simple.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I won't belabor this. And I know the chairman of the Appropriations Committee is trying to get as many of these amendments out of the way as you can. But I certainly hope that my colleagues, and especially all the colleagues who are interested in protecting the hard taxpayers' dollars of this country, and who are interested in getting as many students financial aid that need it, that have the best opportunity to go forward and succeed in their college education and spend the money wisely, that  they would support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair>The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.</chair>
