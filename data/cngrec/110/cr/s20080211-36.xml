    <paragraph>Mr. President, it was a great honor to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives before coming to the Senate and, during that time, to serve with Tom Lantos of California. His was an extraordinary story of a man who survived the Holocaust and came to the U.S. Congress representing a district in the State of California, rising to the rank of chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was as inspiring a speaker as one could ever hear on many topics but especially on the Holocaust and the impact it had on so many innocent people. He was, more than any other person, a leader in acknowledging the bravery and courage of Raoul Wallenberg and so many others who resisted the Holocaust and fought to save the poor victims, including many Jewish people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom Lantos and his wife Annette traveled across the world, speaking on behalf of the United States and developing strong personal relationships with many leaders overseas. He was truly a great representative of the U.S. House of Representatives and of the U.S. Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few weeks ago, we were surprised to learn that he was suffering from cancer and announced he would not be running for reelection. I didn't realize at the time how grave his condition was. His passing over the weekend brings a reminder of his service to our country, his service to the State of California, and the loss which those of us who counted him as a friend will endure in these days of mourning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am happy to join as a cosponsor of this resolution in tribute to Congressman Lantos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements relating to the measure be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
