  <speaking speaker="400162" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="995">H.R. 995</bill>) to amend Public Law 106-348 to extend the authorization for establishing a memorial in the District of Columbia or its environs to honor veterans who became disabled while serving in the Armed Forces of the United States.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 106th Congress authorized the Disabled Veterans Life Memorial Foundation to establish a memorial in Washington, D.C., to honor disabled veterans. The law specified that the memorial is to be established pursuant to the Commemorative Works Act. A memorial site located near the Rayburn House Office Building was identified, but the project is yet to advance due to security and traffic concerns raised by the Architect of the Capitol and the U.S. Capitol Police.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The foundation is in the process of negotiating a solution to that problem. However, the Commemorative Works Act specifies that the legislative authority for any memorial expires 7 years after the date of enactment, October of this year for this proposal. <bill type="h" number="995">H.R. 995</bill>, sponsored by our colleague from Illinois, Representative Phil Hare, amends the original authorization to extend authority to establish the memorial to October 24, 2015.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This extension will allow additional time to ensure an appropriate commemoration to our Nation's disabled veterans to whom we owe a tremendous obligation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Representative Hare is a new Member of this House, he is well acquainted with the sacrifices made by our Nation's veterans, both from his service in the Army Reserves and his more than 20 years as district director for our former colleague and advocate for veterans, Mr. Lane Evans. We congratulate Representative Hare for his work on behalf of this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I might add that, given the ongoing and recent scandal regarding the care and support of our current disabled veterans, this legislation, <bill type="h" number="995">H.R. 995</bill>, is timely and appropriate to honor and remind us of the sacrifice of all veterans and those that are disabled as a consequence of their service to this country. This is an obligation that is owed to them. This memorial would be a fitting reminder that we have an ongoing obligation and responsibility to their care and comfort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we strongly support <bill type="h" number="995">H.R. 995</bill> and urge its adoption by the House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="995">H.R. 995</bill> has been adequately explained by the majority and we support the extension to establish a memorial honoring our disabled veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note that the original law authorizing this memorial was authorized by our own war hero, Congressman Sam Johnson of Texas. Last year, Congressman Sue Kelly of New York introduced this extension bill, and I am happy to see that Congressman Hare is carrying on her legacy. I urge the adoption of the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for the very kind words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="995">H.R. 995</bill>, a bill to extend the authorization for the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial. I introduced <bill type="h" number="995">H.R. 995</bill> along with my colleague Congressman Mark Kirk to provide the time necessary to raise the private funds and navigate the approval process in order to bring this memorial to life in Washington, D.C. Without this bill, the charter for the memorial will expire in October of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Chairman Rahall for quickly moving this legislation through the Resources Committee; and Lois Pope, the Chair of the Disabled Veterans LIFE Memorial Foundation, who has worked tirelessly to establish this memorial since 1996. I also appreciate the efforts of Congressman Kirk and Congressman Dennis Moore to ensure the memorial is funded and dedicated by 2010, and all the other Members who have made this legislation a priority in the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are more than 3 million disabled veterans living today and millions of veterans from past and future conflicts who will be honored by this long overdue memorial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope as a member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs that this memorial will only be the beginning of our recognition of the incredible sacrifices of our veterans. This memorial cannot repay the sacrifice of our disabled veterans, but it will serve as a reminder of the debt that we owe to each and every one of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Transcending conflicts, service branches and generations, the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial will express America's lasting gratitude to the men and women whose lives were forever changed in service to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Due to its proximity to the Capitol, the memorial will remain in the sight of America's lawmakers, serving as a constant reminder of the human cost of conflict and the sacrifices of our disabled veterans. The memorial will be a setting for school groups to learn about disabled veterans, the cost of freedom and the challenges faced by those with disabilities. Most importantly, it will be a place for disabled veterans to come and know they are recognized by a grateful Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be a freshman legislator in the 110th Congress because we are changing this country's priorities. In our recently passed continuing resolution, we increased veterans health care by over $3.6 billion, and we are taking swift action to hold those who are responsible for the inexcusable conditions at Walter Reed accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has a responsibility to plan for the long-term well-being and health of our troops, and I am committed to taking care of our veterans when they are in conflict and when they return home. This bill is a critical first step in honoring the sacrifices our military men and women have made and continue to make for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass <bill type="h" number="995">H.R. 995</bill> and join me and the other 28 cosponsors to ensure this memorial is built and dedicated as soon as possible.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madame Speaker, on February 12, I joined my colleague from Illinois, Mr. Hare, in introducing <bill type="h" number="995">H.R. 995</bill> to extend the authorization of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial through 2015. This legislation will give the American Veterans Disabled for Life Foundation more time to raise the money needed to build this memorial just south of the Rayburn Building. I believe the time has come to recognize the sacrifices made by America's more than three million disabled veterans  by building a memorial for them in here in Washington, D.C.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last December President Bush signed into law a bill to transferring control of the land for the memorial from the District of Columbia to the National Park Service. Now the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Foundation needs to raise approximately $65 million to cover the cost of construction. By passing <bill type="h" number="995">H.R. 995</bill> today, we will give the foundation time to raise this money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year I joined my colleague from Kansas, Mr. Moore, in introducing legislation to authorize the minting of commemorative coins to help raise money for this cause. As we extend the authorization for the memorial today, I want to encourage my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring <bill type="h" number="634">H.R. 634</bill> to issue these coins. No federal funds will be used to build the disabled veterans memorial, but it is appropriate for Congress to do all it can to support and encourage its construction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With more than three million disabled veterans in the United States today, it is fitting that a memorial to their sacrifice be erected in Washington, D.C. It is my hope that passing Mr. Hare's legislation will bring us closer to making the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial a reality.</paragraph>
