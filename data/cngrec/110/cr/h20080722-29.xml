    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to come to the floor today for the consideration of <bill type="h" number="6226">H.R. 6226</bill>, which recognizes the achievements of Stan Lundine. I introduced this measure on June 16, 2008, and the bill enjoys support from members of the New York congressional delegation. <bill type="h" number="6226">H.R. 6226</bill> was considered in committee on July 16, 2008, and was ordered to be reported by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stan Lundine was born on February 4, 1939. He grew up in Jamestown, New York. He served his community as mayor of Jamestown, as a United States Representative, and lieutenant governor of New York. He graduated from Duke University in 1961 and from New York University School of Law in 1964.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As mayor of Jamestown from 1970 to 1976, his work implementing a labor management strategy ended long-running labor conflicts and helped Jamestown gain national attention as a model for labor-management cooperation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his time in Congress from 1976 to 1987, Stan focused on finance, banking and economic development policy. He was chairman of the Subcommittee on International Development Institutions and Finance and played an instrumental role in developing legislation that created labor-management councils and employee stock ownership plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1986, Stan became lieutenant governor of New York under Governor Mario Cuomo, where he focused on housing, economic development, technology, and job training programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Stan continues his public service through his position on the boards of directors for several not-for-profit organizations, including the Chautauqua Institution, the Robert H. Jackson Center, and the Fredonia College Foundation. He also recently served as head of the New York State Commission on Local Efficiency and Government Competitiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before the House today, <bill type="h" number="6226">H.R. 6226</bill>, would honor Stan Lundine by naming a post office in his hometown of Jamestown, New York, in his honor. I urge my colleagues to adopt this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="6226">H.R. 6226</bill>, legislation to designate the post office in Jamestown, New York, as the Stan Lundine Post Office Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stan Lundine is one of Jamestown, New York's most steadfast public servants, who served as mayor of Jamestown, as a United States Representative and as lieutenant governor of New York. A Jamestown native, Stan Lundine was elected mayor of his hometown in 1970, just 6 years after graduating from New York University School of Law. At the start of his career, he found the City of Jamestown crippled by labor strife and immediately implemented a successful labor-management strategy that would receive  national attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Realizing his success as mayor, the people of New York's 39th District elected Lundine to the House in 1976. In his five terms as a Congressman from New York, Stan Lundine continued to focus on labor-management issues and was instrumental in developing legislation that created labor-management councils throughout the country and employee stock ownership plans. While in Congress he also focused on finance and banking, serving as subcommittee chairman of the House Banking Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After a successful career in the House of Representatives, Congressman Lundine declined to seek reelection, but once again turned his attention to State government. In 1986, he was elected lieutenant governor of New York under Mario Cuomo and served his home State for another 8 years. During his tenure as lieutenant governor, he worked on housing, technology, economic development initiatives, as well as training and programming policies, until he and Governor Cuomo were defeated in 1994.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his public service to the State of New York, Congressman Stan Lundine's contributions and accomplishments stretch deep into the private sector. Putting his labor-management skills to use, he now serves as director of the National Forge Company, U.S. Investment Services, and John Ullman Associates. He also serves as executive director of the Chautauqua County Health Network, a group of four hospitals and their physicians dedicated to improving the local health care delivery system  in his community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His contributions to the country, the State of New York and the City of Jamestown are as important as they are lasting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us commemorate his 25 years of public service by naming the post office in his hometown of Jamestown, New York, the Stan Lundine Post Office Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am prepared to yield back the balance of my time and would urge the adoption of the resolution and thank the gentleman for introducing it.</paragraph>
