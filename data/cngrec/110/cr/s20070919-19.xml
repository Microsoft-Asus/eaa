    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor Montclair State University of New Jersey as they celebrate 100 years of service to the students of our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 100th anniversary of Montclair State University is a wonderful cause for celebration. However, the real celebration lies in the extraordinary success of the faculty and administration of Montclair State University in preparing some of New Jersey's finest students to be the next leaders of this country and to succeed in a global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While much has changed since Montclair State University first opened its doors as a normal school in 1908, the university has remained true to its mission of providing an exceptional educational experience to a diverse student body that is reflective of the population of New Jersey. Montclair State University has become one of the leading educational institutions in our State, quickly turning into the second-largest and the fastest-growing university in New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Montclair State University is leading the way to help develop the next generation of teachers by training promising students to be successful, innovative teachers in schools across the State. The university has also maintained an active and positive role in the local community, by bridging education and community service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I ask my colleagues to join me as I honor Montclair State University for its extraordinary success in providing 100 years of world-class education to New Jersey's students and for providing service to our communities.</paragraph>
