  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="HONORING R.C. NORTH PLUMBING &amp; HEATING INC.">
    <paragraph>Madam President, at a time when people from my home State of Maine and throughout the Nation are struggling to cope with an unrelenting climb in energy prices, I rise today to recognize a small business that sells innovative, technological solutions to families and enterprises in Southern and Central Maine. R.C. North Plumbing &amp; Heating Inc. of Naples provides energy-efficient heating and cooling equipment and expertise, which, in turn, enables Mainers to save money and decrease  their energy consumption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>R.C. North Plumbing &amp; Heating Inc., though less than 5 years old, offers years of technical experience in residential heating, cooling, and plumbing, which helps its customers remain confident that their heating and cooling systems are operating at maximum efficiency, thereby saving water, energy, and ultimately money. Furthermore, many of the products that R.C. North sells and installs are designated ENERGY STAR products by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of  Energy because of their energy efficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to providing traditional heating and plumbing services, R.C. North has a burgeoning solar division that offers customers technologies to convert the Sun's power into a safe and reliable energy source for heating water. Additionally, R.C. North participates in the Maine Solar Energy Rebate Program, founded in 2005, to encourage the growth of solar energy in Maine by providing rebates to individuals who purchase solar energy systems. The firm is also certified by the Maine Public Utilities  Commission as an installer of solar thermal heating systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Featured on OurMaine Homes, a local television program highlighting local businesses in the construction and home maintenance industry, R.C. North has received praise from fellow contractors and customers alike. The business is also an active member of the State of Maine Plumbing Heating Cooling Contractors Association and is engaged in the community as a member of the Sebago Lakes Region Chamber of Commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month, Senator Kerry and I held a hearing in the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship that focused on the devastating impacts that the rising price of home heating oil is having on homes and small businesses. During that hearing, what has long been apparent was reiterated for all to hear--namely, that without a proactive approach to stem this crisis and achieve real results, the unmistakable tsunami that is heading for Maine as winter approaches will be far worse  than we have seen. The American people have come to recognize this fact, and companies such as R.C. North Plumbing &amp; Heating have filled the demand that Americans have for energy-efficient heating and cooling systems. The company's foresight and persistence</paragraph>
