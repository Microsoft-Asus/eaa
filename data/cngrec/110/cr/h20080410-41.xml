    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, 60 years ago, outnumbered and under-equipped, the Jews of Palestine beat back five invading Arab armies to win a miraculous victory. Thus, the 2,000-year-old dream of reestablishing a state in the Jewish ancestral homeland was realized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, Israel has wrought out of barren desert and swamp a vibrant and flourishing state. It has harnessed its ingenuity to join the world's ranks of leaders in science, technology and cancer research. Israel remains a vital ally in the globe's most dangerous region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in a post-9/11 world, it is an encouraging reminder that a Democrat state can maintain its humane principles in the face of unrelenting terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today, as Hamas rockets continue to rain on Israeli communities, and former U.S. Presidents are used by Hamas as props in their propaganda war, we, in this Congress, stand to reaffirm the enduring 60-year friendship we have had with Israel.</paragraph>
