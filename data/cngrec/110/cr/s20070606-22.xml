    <paragraph>Mr. President, earlier this week in a special chamber of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, based in The Hague, proceedings began in the trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor, who is accused of crimes against humanity, war crimes, and serious violations of international  law committed during Sierra Leone's 11-year civil war. Tens of thousands died in this conflict that ended in 2002, and more than a third of Sierra Leone's 6  million people were forced to flee. His trial is expect to have significant impact across Sierra Leone but also throughout neighboring countries as his raging brutality was in no way confined by national borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For over a decade, the people of Sierra Leone and Liberia not only suffered from deprivation and displacement at the hands of Charles Taylor, but they also endured forced recruitment of child soldiers, widespread and brutal sexual violence, and horrifying murders and mutilations. Those responsible for these crimes abandoned all human decency in their quest for power and wealth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have long been a strong supporter of accountability mechanisms around the world--and in particular Sierra Leone's Special Court and Truth and Reconciliation Commission. I have worked to ensure that the United States provides appropriate financial and political support for such important institutions, which are crucial to building a framework for the rule of law in postconflict countries. I commend the court for taking its mandate seriously and for following the evidence where it led--directly  to a sitting head of state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite Charles Taylor's unwillingness to appear at the opening of yesterday's trial, the message this critical trial sends--to current and would-be corrupt, violent, and brutal leaders--is momentous: the international community will no longer stand silently by but will support efforts to break the worst cycles of violence and impunity. When the trial continues later this month in The Hague, it is essential that international fair trial standards are adhered to, that robust and transparent outreach  programs continue uninterrupted so the trial remains as accessible as possible to those most affected by the conflict and that great care is taken to ensure the security of victims, witnesses, and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I welcome the proceedings in The Hague, more needs to be done on behalf of the people of Sierra Leone and Liberia. True accountability for the horrific atrocities they endured will only be achieved when the rule of law is respected at every level in the governments of both countries and all citizens have access to justice. Great steps forward have been taken, but much more work remains. I will continue to press the United States and the international community not to desert the people of  Sierra Leone--or the region--as they work to reconcile their grievances and seek to heal from one of Africa's worst conflicts.</paragraph>
