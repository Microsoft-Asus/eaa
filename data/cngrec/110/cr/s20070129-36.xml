    <paragraph>Madam President, today I wish to congratulate the No. 1 volleyball team in America: the University of Nebraska Cornhuskers Women's Volleyball Team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Cornhuskers won their third national title with a 3-1 victory over Stanford University on December 16, 2006. Previously, Nebraska captured National Collegiate Athletic Association's Women's Division I Volleyball Championships in 1995 and 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The win moved Nebraska into a tie for second place on the list of all-time NCAA Volleyball Championships among all schools. The title was also the second for the Huskers under Coach John Cook, who led Nebraska to the 2000 title in his first season as Nebraska's head coach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nebraska ended its 2006 season with a 33-1 record. The team's .971 winning percentage led the Nation and was the second-best mark in school history. The Huskers also became just the third team in NCAA history to be ranked No. 1 for the entire season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the Cornhuskers are the first team outside of the Pacific Ten Conference to win a national title in women's volleyball since Nebraska's last title in 2000. After finishing runner-up last year, Nebraska became just the third volleyball team to ever win the National Championship season after losing in the NCAA's final match. Pennsylvania State University, Penn State, and the University of California at Los Angeles, UCLA, are the only other schools to accomplish such a feat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Attendance at the championship match, played at the Qwest Center in Omaha, NE, totaled 17,209, an all-time collegiate volleyball record. The total attendance for the entire championship session of 34,222 also set an NCAA record. The previous record was 23,978 set during the 1998 Championships in Madison, WI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On their way to winning the national title, several Huskers collected prestigious individual honors as well. Nebraska's 6-foot, 5-inch junior right-side hitter, Sarah Pavan, led the way, winning the American Volleyball Coaches Association's, AVCA, Division I National Player of the Year award and the 2006-2007 Honda Sports Award for volleyball. Pavan became the fourth Husker to win each award. Along with Pavan, sophomore outside hitter Jordan Larson was named an AVCA First Team All-American, while  junior middle blocker Tracy Stalls was a second-team selection and redshirt freshman setter Rachel Holloway was a third-team honoree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a tremendous accomplishment to win a National Championship, and the University of Nebraska's Women's Volleyball Team is to be commended for its excellence and for the pride it has instilled in all Nebraskans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution (<bill type="sr" number="44">S. Res. 44</bill>) was agreed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The preamble was agreed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:</paragraph>
