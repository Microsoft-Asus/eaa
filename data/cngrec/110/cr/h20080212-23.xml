    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to join my colleagues today in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="3532">H.R. 3532</bill> which seeks to name a postal facility in Lula, Georgia, after Private Johnathon Millican, a distinguished and heroic American serviceman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3532">H.R. 3532</bill>, which was introduced by Representative Deal of Georgia, was introduced on September 14, 2007, and was considered and reported by the Oversight Committee on January 29, 2008, by a voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure has the support of the entire congressional delegation from the State of Georgia and provides us with yet another opportunity to pay tribute to a member of our country's armed service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Johnathon Millican served his country proudly as a member of an airborne artillery brigade based out of Fort Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, where I was a few weeks ago, and it is very cold out there, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Private Millican gave his life in his service to our country when, on January 20, 2007, his unit was attacked by enemy insurgents in Karbala, Iraq. While Private Millican was only 20 years old when he lost his life in the line of duty, his service and faithful commitment to preserving the liberties and freedoms on which our Nation is built are sure to live on forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let's remember and pay tribute to the ultimate sacrifice made by Private Millican. I urge the swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a mere 20 years old, Private First Class Johnathon Millican of Trafford, Alabama, displayed wisdom beyond his years when he once said, "You don't have to love the war, but you have to love the warrior."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an honor for me to speak today about Private Millican, a true American hero who epitomizes bravery and loyalty to his country and fellow comrades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Soon after graduating high school in 2005, Johnathon Millican enlisted into the Army and was assigned to the 377th Parachute Field Artillery Regiment from Fort Richardson, Alaska. In Karbala, Iraq, on January 20, 2007, Private Millican was off duty in a communications room talking with his wife, Shannon, when an attack started. The attackers fired several rounds and a grenade into the room, and tragically, he and four fellow officers lost their lives. Private Millican had been in Iraq for just  3 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Family and friends will forever remember Johnathon Millican's dedication to the cause of freedom and his commitment to bringing that cherished freedom to the people around the world where he served. It is with gratitude for his bravery and sacrifice and for the sacrifice of those who loved him that I ask all Members to join me in naming the Lula, Georgia, postal facility located on McLeod Street in his honor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Army Private First Class Johnathon Miles Millican, dedicating the United States Post Office located in Lula, Georgia, as the "Private Johnathon Millican Lula Post Office."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty-year-old Private First Class Johnathon Millican, a Hall County, Georgia, native, was killed by insurgents in Iraq while conducting a dismounted operation in Karbala on January 20, 2007. Private First Class Millican was off duty in a communications room talking with his wife when the attackers fired several rounds into the room with an AK-47 and one of them tossed in a concussion grenade. Courageously, he covered the grenade with his body, attempting to protect his comrades from the enemy  intrusion. Private First Class Johnathon Millican was later awarded the Silver Star Medal of Honor for his courage, valor, and dedication for his fellow soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Johnathon Millican had attended Lula Elementary, East Hall Middle School, and East Hall High school in my home County of Hall. While in high school, Johnathon was active in the community, working the concessions stand at the community ballpark and coaching a 5-year-old T-Ball team. After graduating from high school in 2005, he moved to Locust Grove, Alabama, before enlisting in the Army. Johnathon was a member of the 377th Parachute Field Artillery Regiment from Fort Richardson, Alaska. Johnathon  Millican left behind his wife, Shannon; his parents, Mitchell and Angie Millican; and Mary and Ronald Lykins and sisters, Amber'le, Ashley, and Amanda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to rise today to pay tribute to this courageous young man and to join my constituents  of Lula, Georgia, in naming the "Private Johnathon Millican Post Office." This honor will serve as a lasting reminder of the true recognition that is deserving of a fallen hometown hero who sacrificed his life to save the lives of his fellow soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a copy of the letter from Mr. Milton Turner, the Mayor of the City of Lula, requesting that this post office be named the "Private Johnathon Millican Lula Post Office."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CITY OF LULA,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lula, GA, August 20, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CONGRESSMAN DEAL: This letter represents the request of the City of Lula to recognize and honor the sacrifice and contributions made by a local young man, a fallen hero, Private First Class Johnathon Millican with the recognition and honor of his service and dedication to his country the naming of the Lula Post Office located on McLoud Street. Our 20-year-old young hero (a Hall County Native), was killed by insurgents in Iraq on Jan. 20, he had covered an enemy concussion grenade  with his body attempting to protect his comrades from the enemy intrusion and was one of five U.S. soldiers killed during the attack in Karbala.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Johnathon had attended Lula Elementary and East Hall Middle School and High School only recently moving to Locust Grove Alabama before enlisting in the Army. Millican was a member of the 377th Parachute Field Artillery Regiment from Fort Richardson, Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PFC Millican was off duty in a communications room exchanging e-mails with his wife when the Jan. 20 attack started. The attackers fired several rounds into the room with an AK47 and one of them tossed in a grenade. In an earlier interview, Mitchell Millican told The Birmingham News his son was on one knee facing the door "ready to shoot" at that point and "He could just as easily have jumped behind a desk or ducked down or whatever, but he chose to cover the grenade" Mitchell Millican said</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know of your commitment to our service men and woman and know how moved you were at his loss; this honor would help to establish the true recognition deserving of a fallen hero. Also we would encourage your efforts to move forward the campaign to have the pentagon award PFC J. Millican with the "Medal of Honor" a process which we realize could take months or even years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further we hope to have the opportunity in the near future to honor Jonathon's heroics here in Hall County and depending on your guidance will await some possible timetable for suggested dedication. Please advise the city of your schedule allowing your attendance and participation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Best regards,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to express my full support for <bill type="h" number="3532">H.R. 3532</bill>, naming the Federal post office in Lula, Georgia, in honor of PFC Johnathon Millican. It is a fitting tribute to a brave solider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This recognition from the community where Johnathon spent his boyhood comes in addition to the inspiring ceremony held last July 28 at Locust Fork High School in Alabama, where Johnathon received his diploma. It was my great privilege to participate in the ceremony, in which Johnathon's wife and father were presented with his posthumous Silver Star award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Johnathon's actions during the raid on Karbala on January 20, 2007 are the embodiment of the scriptural passage that says there is no greater love for a man than to lay down his life for his friends. His valor saved the lives of his fellow soldiers, and he died defending freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time, allow me to introduce the remarks I made during the ceremony into the RECORD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The actions of Johnathon Millican embody the same scriptural passage that we've heard at funerals of many of our veterans. It is: Greater love has no man than this, that one lay down his life for his friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Johnathon's life was short, but his legacy will stand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His father shared with me a conversation he had with Johnathon just before he graduated here. Many of Johnathon's classmates were planning for college. Others had lined up a job. Still others were talking about how they were going to spend their summers, the things they were going to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Johnathon had already made another decision. He was going to enlist in the Army. The call to duty to serve his country was strong in the aftermath of 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Johnathon knew there would be personal sacrifices involved. He knew the fight would not be easy. In fact, his father reminded him that it could be dangerous. Johnathon accepted that. But Johnathon believed in the mission. From Iraq, he posted an observation on the Internet which I wish everyone in this country would observe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The quote is, "You don't have to love the war but you have to love the warrior."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One definition of warrior is "someone notable strength of spirit."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Johnathon resoundingly demonstrated those qualities this past January 20th, when insurgents broke into the government compound in Karbala.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is Johnathon's valor and our concern for all our young men and women in the field that brings us together. The Silver Star Award has given each and every one of us an opportunity to thank Johnathon and his family in a tangible way for his service and his courage. I very much appreciate each and every one of you who have come out this morning to show your love, your compassion, and your gratitude to Johnathon and his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a struggle to find the right words at a time like this. I think it's best to go to the soldiers in the field. Let me read from the email sent to me this week from Iraq by Captain Tom Morris, who was Johnathon's commanding officer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"As a commander of troops in combat, losing your soldiers is harder than losing family members. Speaking at Johnathon's memorial service was the hardest thing I ever had to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"It brings me great pleasure to know that he is being awarded the Silver Star and that there will be a memorial at his high school in his honor. I believe the most important thing to do is to tell his story to those who do not know it, especially those who attend his school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I will always remember him, especially his deep southern accent and that he was a country boy who was the toughest there was and that nothing really bothered him. I can only hope that I can be as strong, both mentally and physically, as he was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"He will be missed, but never forgotten. He was my soldier, friend, and fellow paratrooper."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Hero" is an overused word these days. It's used to describe a TV actor or football player. There is a difference between fame and worthy accomplishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason we need to tell Johnathon's story is so people, especially our young men and women and boys and girls, do understand the difference between celebrity and heroism. The students who go past the memorial here at Locust Fork High School will know that a real hero walked their halls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To conclude, a passage from Corinthians (16:13) is appropriate for Johnathon and all of the soldiers who protect us. It reads:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Be on your guard, stand firm in the faith, be men of courage, be strong."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These words apply perfectly to Johnathon, and why he is deserving of the Silver Star being presented to his family today.</paragraph>
