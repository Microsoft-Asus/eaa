  <speaking speaker="400216" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today is a day of mixed emotion for all of us who work with the House Page Program. It is time to say goodbye to 70 aspiring young individuals who have served the U.S. Congress for the last several months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives, I would like to thank you all for your hard work, your commitment and dedication to the Page Program. I know you have made your families, friends and communities back home proud, and I am certain that they will be glad to receive you back home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As difficult as it is to say goodbye, I trust that you will take with you memories, experiences and friends that will last a lifetime. Take with you also our sincere thanks for a job well done. Your hard work and your dedication have proven that you are young people with strength, courage and character. We look forward to hearing about all your many future successes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Sutton) joins me in these thoughts, but we will not say goodbye but rather farewell until we meet again. And Mr. Speaker, before I yield to other Members, I would like insert the names of the pages at this point in the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Spring 2007 House Page List</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield now to the ranking Republican member of the Page Board, the gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Capito).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank my colleague from Michigan for his leadership on the Page Board and for his deep compassion for what the Page Program has done for the youth of America historically and for this particular group today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As he said, we're not here to say goodbye; we're here to say farewell and Godspeed and good luck.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As any ending is, the ending of this year is a new beginning for you all to return to your homes, your families and have a good summer at the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm very proud of the 70 pages, 33 girls, 37 boys, that represent 26 States and one territory, and I would like to congratulate you on the completion of your Page Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I asked several pages throughout the day, have you enjoyed your time here? How has it been? And one said to me very poignantly, he said, I have enjoyed every single day. And I think that is shared across the board by the 70 bright smiling faces I see at the back of the Chamber today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It certainly has been a historic year for this Congress under the stewardship of the first woman Speaker of the House of Representatives. So, for all the female pages, it has been a source of great pride for all of us. So I thank you for your leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it's important to note that not only will we be seeing you again, we'll be seeing you in different iterations of your life, as many former pages are now Members of Congress, Senators, corporate leaders, Governors and future leaders of our States and our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I say, thank you, from the Cloak Room on the Republican side. Ms. Pat and Ms. Doris say thank you very much for all of the help you gave to them in helping us, and on the other side, I'm sure that's true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I say, good luck, make sure you don't forget us, and I won't forget the most I think vibrant day in the House of Representatives, which is the day that the President comes to give his State of the Union address, and the first thing I notice is the excitement of the pages, getting to see that for the first time, lined in the back, hoping to catch a glimpse or a handshake or a pat on the back from their President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So good luck to all of you and thank you very much, and I thank the gentleman from Michigan for yielding.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from West Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) who's been very active in supporting the Page Program.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding, and I want to say to Mr. Kildee, those of you who have been our pages and have made such an extraordinary contribution to this institution, Mr. Kildee has been on the Page Board for almost, as a matter of fact, maybe as long as I've been a Member of Congress, which is longer than, by almost a factor of two, not quite, all of you have been alive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You come to this institution with a great responsibility, in my opinion. You are extraordinary young people in high school, learning not only about government but learning about all the other skills that you will need to know to be successful and to help your country be successful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program, I think, is an extraordinarily important program because of what it does. It gives to you at a young age while you are learning the opportunity to see firsthand your democracy in action, to see those who have been selected by your parents, by your brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles and your neighbors and friends to represent them in the Congress of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You have been given this unique opportunity that a very, very small segment of your fellow cohorts, your generation, will have had, to come firsthand to see the Members, who are all human beings, who all have ideas, who all have passions and fears and visions and desires like your parents and you have and who come here on behalf of their constituents to try to do good for their country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As president of the Maryland Senate in the 1970s, I had the opportunity to run the Page Program in the State Senate, and I was always hopeful that those young people, who were your age, 16, 17 years of age, they were seniors, for the most part, you're juniors, would leave their service in this institution and in that institution with a positive perspective, with a thought that this democracy, founded so many centuries ago, still is a viable democracy that, as Winston Churchill said, is the best  of all other forms of government tried.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is, as you have seen, not perfect, but it has created one of the greatest societies that has ever existed, not the only great society but one of the greatest, and you have helped us make it function.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And sometimes you will think to yourself, well, I didn't get on the floor and speak; you're obviously not a Member; and perhaps you didn't write a great treatise on this issue or that issue and will feel from time to time, well, all I did was run this envelope from this office to that office or from the floor of the House to someplace else or, from time to time, get information for a Member who was debating something on the floor. But your service made this institution run better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Kennedy was a hero of mine, and, frankly, I got into politics because of John Kennedy. He came to the campus of the University of Maryland, talked about the difference that young people could make. He spoke on this floor at least on three occasions where he gave his State of the Union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In his inaugural address, he said to all of us that the energy, the faith, the devotion we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it, and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pages, I hope you leave from here with a better knowledge of how the people's House works and with a renewed conviction that your democracy works, perhaps, better than you thought or some had told you it did and that you will leave this place with an energy and a faith and a devotion to letting your colleagues know how well their democracy works and with the conviction that if they participate fully in this democracy that it will work even better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for your service. Thank you for what you do in your communities, in your schools and in your communities, and thank you for transmitting the knowledge you have learned to literally thousands of your friends and colleagues. Godspeed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I wonder if the gentleman would yield?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400216" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would be happy to yield.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400432" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me just say, not everyone within the sound of my voice realizes how hard these young people have worked, some of them, for the last semester, some of them for the past 9 or 10 months, but almost to a person they have been in the page school. There will be a graduation ceremony tomorrow, I understand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They get up in the wee hours of the morning and go to school in a very rigorous academic course, and then they put in a full day. On those frequent occasions when we are in session late at night, they are here with us. So we appreciate their hard work. It has been a great learning experience for them, I know; and I just want them to know how much we appreciate it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have been here during momentous times. They have seen the President of the United States, as my friend from Maryland stated. They have seen heads of state come and go in the building and witnessed debates concerning the great issues of our time, issues today concerning the very question of life itself. Issues of war and peace and billions of dollars being debated, they have been able to witness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as significantly as all of those issues, they have witnessed the orderly transfer of power that we have seen year in and year out, Congress in and Congress out in this great institution. The transfer of power not at the point of a gun, as a result of a battle, but as a result of Americans, one by one, going eventually in the millions and voting in the ballot at the ballot box.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sometimes we are delighted with that orderly transfer of power, as I was in 1994 and 1995, when I first came here as a Member of a new majority. Sometimes, as occurred last November and this past January, I was not particularly overly delighted, but it is profound, nonetheless, that we make those changes in government at the ballot box and not at the point of a gun.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1967, I had the privilege for only 1 month to serve as a page in this great Chamber for this great body. It was a life-changing experience for a young boy from Pontotoc, Mississippi; and I daresay for the young people lining the back rail and listening to our words this afternoon it has been, in so many ways, a life-changing experience for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It occurred to me during that brief stay here as a page that I might someday, if given an opportunity and if luck came through, come back here as a Member of the House of Representatives. I had that great opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But to so many of them, undoubtedly, they have no desire whatever to come back here as a Member but to go on and serve their country in other respects, in their professions, perhaps in the military, or perhaps some of you also in public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I would simply say that, in closing, they have had such a rare opportunity to serve their country in a way that so few young people have been able to do. We appreciate it very, very, very much. We wish each and every one of them Godspeed as they go back to their homes and families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for yielding the time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400216" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for his very fine words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Godspeed to you all.</paragraph>
