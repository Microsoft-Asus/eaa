    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate LTC Jean McGinnis upon retiring from military service. For more than 25 years, our Nation has been fortunate to have such an intelligent, accomplished and decorated American in our armed services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lieutenant McGinnis exemplifies selfless devotion to one's country. Born in Deadwood, SD, Lieutenant McGinnis began her service early. The New Mexico Military Institute commissioned her as a 2nd lieutenant before she even completed her bachelor's degree at Texas A&amp;M. She joined the Army Reserve as an active Guard Reserve Officer, and continued her education at Fort Eustis, VA, where she successfully passed the aviation maintenance officer course to become an Army test pilot in the UH-1 Huey helicopter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1991, Captain McGinnis was stationed in Pennsylvania at the Willow Grove Naval Air Station as the aviation operations officer for the 2/288th Aviation Regiment. Five years later, she was assigned to the Office of the Chief, Army Reserve, Program Analysis and Evaluation Division and then as a budget analyst for the Army. In 1999, Major McGinnis moved to Arlington, VA, in order to serve as a congressional liaison after training at the Command and General Staff College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout her service, Lieutenant McGinnis has gained wide recognition from her commanding officers. She has earned the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Senior Army Aviator Badge, and the Air Assault Badge and the Army Staff Badge. These accomplishments speak volumes for her dedicated service to the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with great pride that I commend Lieutenant Jean McGinnis on this wonderful accomplishment. You have served our Nation with distinction, and I wish you the best on your well-deserved retirement.</paragraph>
