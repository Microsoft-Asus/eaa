  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, many praiseworthy things have been said about Gerald Rudolph Ford over the past 2 weeks, and this is good. It is good to see so many people speak so well of a man who was often wrongly criticized in life, and it has been uplifting to watch an entire nation stop and reflect on what it means to live a good life, good to see that old virtues still have the power to inspire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, Gerald Ford didn't seek out the Presidency, and certainly he came into the highest elected position in the land in the unlikeliest of ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was recently reminded that his life didn't get off to the most promising start. Born Leslie Lynch King, Jr., in Omaha, NE, his mother and father divorced when he was 2.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His mother picked up and moved back home to Grand Rapids, where she married a paint and varnish salesman. Gerald Ford, Sr., gave Dorothy three more boys--and her first son a new name that he would carry into history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The childhood home was pleasant, but since money was tight, Junior had to mow lawns and grill hamburgers after school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The experiences of the boy had an effect on the man: Ford would later gain a reputation in Congress as a fiscal conservative, as someone who thought that Government, like any household, should live within its budget. He didn't learn this from a policy paper. He didn't need to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard that Gerald Ford was a great athlete, that he could have played with the Packers or the Lions, but he took a job as an assistant coach at Yale instead. And determined to go to Yale Law School, he convinced the faculty to let him on parttime. They did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerry Ford once said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The harder you work, the luckier you are. I worked like hell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He ended up in the top fourth of a law school class that included a future Supreme Court Justice, a future Secretary of State--and a future President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard how President Ford signed up for the Navy after Pearl Harbor; that he put duty and country first, and nearly got swept off the deck of the USS Monterey in the middle of a typhoon. It wouldn't be his last brush with an early death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we have heard a love story: that Ford came home to Michigan after the war and married a pretty young dancer named Betty Bloomer; that he started to think about politics, and that Betty wasn't worried at all about it distracting from family life. "I never thought he'd win," she said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, of course, he did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Fords moved east, and decided to stay awhile, and stayed together through it all--until last week, when Betty, older now but no less graceful, said good-bye to her husband, the President, in the same church where they said "I do" 58 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been inspired by the story of President Ford's political career--how he didn't make a name for himself with high-profile speeches or partisan broadsides; how he did his job, and did it well, in big and little things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He built a reputation as someone who could bridge the gap, who brought people together and worked problems out. Gerry Ford summed up his approach to lawmaking this way:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You have to give a little, take a little, to get what you really want. But you don't give up your principles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All this is what we have heard about Gerald Rudolph Ford's life before the President of the United States called him at home on October 6, 1973, to see if he would be willing to replace a Vice President who had resigned in disgrace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressmen all over Washington were sitting by their phones that night, hoping the call would come for them. Gerry Ford was swimming laps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And 8 months later, when the President himself resigned, Ford was there again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's a plaque at the Ford library which says that Gerald Ford may have been among the unluckiest Presidents of the 20th century. Where I come from we don't call that luck. We call it providence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Ford himself put it: 1975 was "not a time for summer soldiers and sunshine patriots. It was a year of fears and alarms." Gerry Ford was the right man for the moment because he was a good man all along.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what did he bring to the presidency? Exactly what we needed in that dark and painful hour: honesty, simplicity, and what he liked to call, "a little straight talk".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ford's sincerity may have been his greatest gift, but it almost surely cost him the greatest honor the voters could have given him. He told them plainly, just a few months after taking the oath, that the state of the Union wasn't good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He gave them bad news again the next year, an election year when most people would have been tempted to gloss over problems. The state of the Union was better, he said, but it still wasn't good enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And when he lost, he wasn't bitter. He even made a point to make sure the transition was smooth. He didn't want Jimmy Carter to face the same problems he did, he said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember those days. I was a young lawyer in Ford's Justice Department. I remember how the new President restored hope in our country, in the presidency, and in the Republican Party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember how he lost his own race for reelection but cleared the way for another great Midwesterner to win 4 years later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Nation has owed a tribute to Gerald Ford for a long time, and it is good that he has gotten it in these last days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In weaker moments, we tend to think that victory goes to the fast, the brilliant, the well-born. But in one of our Nation's weakest moments, Gerald Ford showed us leadership through the gentlemanly virtues of honesty, integrity, and plain hard work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tributes now are almost done. But the greatest tribute we can give to Gerald Rudolph Ford lies ahead. The American people have shown how much they admire leaders who are honest, straightforward, kind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the early days of a new session, we best honor the memory of our 38th President, and the Nation he loved and served so well, by making those qualities our own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Chair recognizes the Senator from Virginia.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank our distinguished majority leader and minority leader for their initiative in putting this resolution together. I, also, thank both of our distinguished leaders for including in the resolution a reference to the action by the Senate, an initiative we took in the Senate Armed Services Committee at the time that I was privileged to be chairman and the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, was the ranking member, to name one of America's future  aircraft carriers, now under construction, the USS Gerald R. Ford. This initiative then was taken into consideration by the Department of Defense, the Secretary at that time, and, indeed, the Secretary of the Navy. The Secretary of the Navy has, traditionally, responsibility</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Defense will host a ceremony on January 16th, with the Ford family and others to formally name the ship in honor of President Ford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, also, thank Jack Marsh, former Secretary of the Army and former counselor to President Ford, for his participation in the effort by the Senate to take this initiative, as well as former Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird. I collaborated with both of those distinguished gentlemen. Secretary Laird was a lifetime friend and served in Congress with, then, Gerald Ford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we go forth in our careers, we always should look back to acknowledge those who made it possible for us to achieve our goals. I am always very humbled by the many people who helped inspire me to run for the Senate and who helped me win election. Gerald Ford was right there at the beginning of my first race with sound, practical advice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the indulgence of my colleagues where I recount some of that advice: It started, I remember, in the summer of 1960. I was an advance man for then Vice President Nixon. We were on a campaign train trip through the Middle Western States, that included a stop in Michigan. This was the old-fashioned train with the observation car, where the candidate would go out on the rear platform and give a speech to the crowds that gathered in all the little towns and communities along the route. But we  had one very memorable stop, I remember the town was Muskegon, Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My job was to get the candidate, the Vice President, and some of his senior staff off the train and to the auditorium in town. In performing these tasks, I was joined by an elected Michigan official. In a moment, I will provide his name. As we entered the building, we went into a holding area. I was awaiting a cue from the master of ceremonies on stage to bring on the Vice President. He was escorted by this local official. As we were waiting, unbeknownst to us, in the balcony, some mischievous  people--I don't think it was evil, but it was mischievous--suddenly pelted us all with raw eggs. There we were, the Vice President with eggs streaming down off him. I took out my handkerchief and did the best I could to polish him up a bit, and the local official did the same. The Vice President went on the stage, fully composed, and gave an excellent speech.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I went back to the train thinking that I would be severely reprimanded and my first job in politics terminated. Well, it turns out that the local official who helped me get him up to the stage and who also helped to polish-up the Vice President joined me in the observation car, where they were serving beer. As he came in, I thanked him, but said: You know, I think this is the end of my political career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And he said: Why so?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I described my responsibility. And he then said: Well, of course, I am a local Congressman and I should bear the responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we joined each other with a beer, he said to me: You know, I think both of us will survive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was Gerald Ford, showing the magnanimity of that marvelous man and his understanding of those types of situations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank that wonderful American for his contribution to inspire me later in years to try for the Senate. He was then Vice President, and he used to counsel me on how to get started in public life. I was then Secretary of the Navy, having succeeded John Chafee, a former Member of this body, the much revered Senator from Rhode Island. And John Chafee had left the Navy Secretary's Office and ran for the Senate and was defeated in his first bid. And I was ready to plunge in and try my first  race when Ford said to me: No, you want to kind of get behind you this career in the Department of Defense, because it was a highly controversial period of history. There was much concern among the citizenry, not unlike what we see today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I took his advice. And he said: Go run the Bicentennial. I will get you appointed to that Presidential Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said: Mr. President, I don't even know how to spell the word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said: Study up on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only did he do that, but he came down as Vice President and administered the oath to me on the steps of his beloved House of Representatives. The Bicentennial was a marvelous career opportunity to learn the fundamentals of public office. I worked with him  closely, took an enormous interest, as he knew the Bicentennial would become a healing mechanism for the country in the aftermath of Watergate. He was right. I traveled with him on July 4, 1976,  in his helicopter, and we made stops along the way. I will never forget going to New York Harbor on the final day of the two year celebration. And there we were on the deck of a carrier. And he struck the ship's bell such that it triggered church bells all across the United States to celebrate that day in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we were standing there, he told me about his trip to sea in 1944. I read from his biography:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His closest call with death came not as a result of enemy fire, however, but during a vicious typhoon in the Philippine Sea in December 1944. He came within inches of being swept overboard while the storm raged. The ship, which was severely damaged by the storm and the resulting fire, had to be taken out of service. Ford spent the remainder of the war ashore and was discharged as a lieutenant commander in February 1946.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the course of the war, he was awarded the Bronze Star, and other decorations for his valiant service. But I remember when I went overseas in 1951, as a communications officer for a Marine Corps squadron. We were aboard the same class of ship. It was a small carrier. We also went through a typhoon in the South Pacific en route to Korea. It was 72 hours of memory that will never be erased, but I know what he went through because I think that typhoon was far more severe than the one our ship  experienced. So I take my hat off to this magnificent American, who was among those who made it possible for me, in many respects, to eventually be privileged to represent the State of Virginia in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the sense of Congress naming the CVN-78 aircraft carrier as the USS Gerald R. Ford be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of Michigan's great sons. Today we honor the remarkable life and lasting legacy of President Gerald R. Ford. I thank our leaders and colleagues for the wonderful tribute that will be voted on at noontime today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past week our Nation mourned the passing of a President, while Michigan mourned the loss of a family member. Throughout his decades in public service, including a quarter century representing Michigan in the Congress, Gerald Ford worked tirelessly to serve the people and the interests of our great State and his beloved country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an honor that the State of Michigan will serve as the final resting place for one of our Nation's great leaders. The funeral last Wednesday, which I was fortunate enough to attend, was truly a moving tribute to a man who cared deeply for the city of Grand Rapids, his home State of Michigan, and the country. The thousands of mourners who came to pay their respects is evidence of what he meant to us. People standing in line for hours, on into the night, and the wonderful, gracious way the  family greeted so many of those coming to show their respect for Gerald Ford was a wonderful, meaningful act to watch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would be remiss if I didn't take the opportunity to speak about Gerald Ford's family. Betty Ford's grace and strength throughout the past few weeks have stood as a reminder not only of the importance of family in the life of Gerald Ford but also how much she has given to America through her courage, her example, and her charity. Betty Ford stood shoulder to shoulder with President Ford as a true partner throughout his life, while redefining the role of First Lady and serving the country with  her own dedicated work on issues such as alcohol and drug abuse. Together the Fords raised four remarkable children--Michael, John, Steven, and Susan. It is a testimony to Gerald Ford's character that he will be remembered not only as a great leader but as a wonderful husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born July 14, 1913, in Omaha, NE, Ford moved at a young age with his mother to Grand Rapids, MI, to live with his stepfather.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While attending South High School in Grand Rapids, Ford proved himself an academic and athletic prodigy, being named not only to the honor society but all-city and all-State football teams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1931, Gerald Ford entered the University of Michigan, playing center and linebacker for the Wolverines. He played on two undefeated teams and was named the team's most outstanding player in 1934. Ford's legacy will always be felt at the university. To this day, his number 28 is one of only 5 football jerseys retired by the University of Michigan, while the School of Public Policy bearing his name will shape and produce America's leaders for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald Ford's childhood in Grand Rapids and his education both on and off the field at the University of Michigan helped forge a man whose character and actions throughout his life exemplified what is best about Michigan--hard work, loyalty, honesty, and selflessness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduating from Michigan, Ford rebuffed offers from the Detroit Lions and the Green Bay Packers in order to attend Yale University Law School. He continued his love of athletics there by serving as a boxing coach and assistant varsity football coach. In 1941, he earned his law degree from Yale, graduating in the top quarter of his class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald Ford then returned to the city he considered his home, Grand Rapids, to practice law before joining the U.S. Naval Reserve in April 1942, serving as an assistant navigator with the USS Monterey in the Pacific during World War II. Ford was discharged from the Navy in 1946 as a lieutenant commander, returning to Michigan to practice law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Entering politics with the encouragement of his stepfather, Gerald Ford ran for Congress in 1948, unseating incumbent Bartel Jonkman in the primary and going on to receive 61 percent of the vote in the general election. Gerald Ford would go on to represent the people of Michigan in Congress for the next 25 years, in 1965 rising to become the minority leader in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In late 1973, Ford was called on to serve the country in a different capacity, as we all know, being named and confirmed Vice President. Within 8 short months, he was again called on to take the mantle of responsibility he had not sought, taking the oath of office as the 38th President of the United States. Stepping into the Oval Office during one of America's greatest constitutional crises, President Ford's quiet demeanor and steady hand helped calm a nation and kept the Government moving forward  during some of its darkest days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a testament to President Ford and his time in public office, highlighted by his years in the White House, that even those who disagreed with his policy positions respected him as a person and a public servant. Gerald Ford dedicated his life to make our State and our Nation a better place to live, work, and raise a family. He was a man who understood that integrity and service are more than just words, they are ideals--ideals he learned in our wonderful Michigan and practiced every day of  his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a husband, a father, a Congressman, and our President, he led quietly by example, earning respect and friendship on both sides of the aisle through the hard work and honesty for which he was known. President Ford was a man utterly deserving of the words inscribed on a football resting on a homemade memorial outside the Ford Museum in Grand Rapids this week:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A true American and a hometown hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford, we thank you for your service. You will be missed. Our continuing prayers and support go to your family.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300023" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am very pleased the Senate is formally expressing its respect and appreciation for the life and public service of President Gerald R. Ford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No person in public service in my memory did more to restore confidence in our political institutions than President Ford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a friend and mentor to me as a member of the body, giving me sound advice and serving as a wonderful role model during my career in Congress and in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I admired him enormously. His seriousness of purpose and his common sense approach to solving our national problems were qualities that enabled him to give our nation a new sense of confidence and direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are deeply grateful that he served so ably as our Republican Leader in the House, Vice President, and President of the United States.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400629" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in memory of Gerald Ford, the 38th President of the United States. President Ford shouldered his burden with a unique sense of humility and good humor, in an office not known for nourishing those traits. President Ford's unusual combination of courage, strength, and conviction led America out of a deep crisis, healing our wounds and strengthening our Constitution in the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald Ford was a self-made Michigander who worked part-time jobs as a young man to help support his family, and later to put himself through Yale Law School. A man of many talents, he could have been a professional football player, or lived well as an attorney. But instead, he chose a life of service, first as a decorated naval officer, then a 24-year Member of Congress, leader of his party in the House of Representatives, and Presiding Officer of this Chamber as Vice President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Domestic turmoil and foreign policy challenges marked the mid-1970s, and President Ford addressed them both. History has favorably judged his actions to move the country beyond the Watergate scandal, although he paid a heavy price at the time. He also acknowledged the severe economic difficulties faced by millions of Americans and worked head-on to alleviate them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the host of domestic challenges America faced, President Ford remained a committed internationalist. He advanced the cause of peace in the Middle East, helping to end hostilities between Israel and Egypt and laying the groundwork for a peace between those two countries that endures to this day. His backing of the Helsinki Accords, while controversial, gave important support to dissidents living under Soviet rule who sought respect for their human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his life, Gerald Ford handled the responsibilities and challenges that circumstance thrust on him without losing his Midwestern openness and sensibility. To many who disagreed with him, he still came across as a comforting figure who had the Nation's best interests at heart. Central to this ability to connect with people was his self-deprecating sense of humor, summed up by the quip, "I'm a Ford, not a Lincoln."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while he may not have been a Lincoln, he certainly was not a common President. America is a better place because of him, and we all owe President Ford and his wife, Betty, a tremendous debt of gratitude.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to President Gerald Ford. His passing on December 26, 2006, was marked with a yearning for the unity he brought to our Nation over 30 years ago. I extend my sincerest and most heartfelt sympathies to his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald Ford and I were in Congress together for a brief period of time. He was a friend to me when I was a freshman Senator and throughout my career. I will always remember and appreciate his support and counsel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford came into office at a very difficult time and faced multiple tasks. He met those challenges and successfully brought the Nation through a tumultuous period in the history of the presidency. While his time in the White House was relatively short, his legacy continues to persist. President Ford's leadership and credibility worked to bring the Nation through the Watergate crisis and its aftermath. That proved to be invaluable and underscored the resiliency of our democratic government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife Nancy and I send our condolences and prayers to First Lady Betty Ford and to the entire Ford family. We join the Nation in mourning President Ford and in honoring a long life of service. May his soul rest in peace.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the 38th President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald Ford was an honest man, a modest man, and a patriotic man who cared deeply about this country. During World War II, he answered his Nation's call to duty, serving in the Navy aboard the USS Monterey in the Pacific Theatre. He later trained new naval officers for sea duty. Shortly after his discharge as a lieutenant commander in 1946, he began his storied political career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his 25 years of service in the House of Representatives, Gerald Ford earned the respect and admiration of nearly everyone in Washington. Gerald Ford's impeccable integrity made him the ideal choice to lead America at a time of considerable division.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he was nominated by President Nixon to become Vice President, he was confirmed overwhelmingly by the Senate and the House. The Senate vote was 92-3, and the House vote was 387-35.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before President Nixon submitted his nomination for Vice President, he asked the leadership of both parties who they would choose were they in his shoes. The obvious response was Gerald Ford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Gerald Ford assumed the Presidency following President Nixon's resignation, he moved quickly to bring our country together. He did this by always remaining true to his character. He also adhered to the common-sense principles that guided him throughout his career and his life. He never lost touch with his Midwestern values. And he never wavered from doing what he thought was in the best interests of the people of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford also attracted very talented employees. Among those who served in the Ford Administration were Alan Greenspan, Council of Economic Advisers; George H.W. Bush, CIA Director; James Baker, Undersecretary of Commerce; Dick Cheney, Chief of Staff; and Donald Rumsfeld, Chief of Staff and later Secretary of Defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the pleasure of working with President Ford when he appointed me  vice chair of the National Transportation Safety Board in 1976.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford was a reliable friend and invaluable counselor. I will never forget his coming to Texas to campaign with me during my first race for the Senate. President Ford was always available to offer advice and remained in close touch with those of us who were his many appointees, staff, and colleagues over the years. This is the kind of person he was. It was an honor and a privilege to consider him a friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He cared deeply for his family, for his loving wife Betty, and for his four children: Michael, John, Steven, Susan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He cared for everyone he came to know during his magnificent political career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My thoughts and prayers go out to Betty and the entire Ford family as we honor a public servant who gave tirelessly to our country. He will be missed.</paragraph>
