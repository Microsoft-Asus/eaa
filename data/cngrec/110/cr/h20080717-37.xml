    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of J. Fred Patton, a gracious contributor to the Third District of Arkansas, who passed away earlier this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than 101 years, Mr. Patton showed passion for Arkansas through his compassion for neighbors, community service and education that he provided for future Arkansans. He authored "The History of Fort Smith," now in its seventh edition, and taught Sunday school for more than six decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his life, Mr. Patton received numerous professional, civic and humanitarian awards, including the honor of being selected as one of 10 outstanding citizens in western Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma in 1989. I had the privilege to meet and get to know Fred over the years, and he truly was an amazing person who wanted the best for his community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Patton certainly will be missed. However, his legacy will live on for generations to come. I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to celebrate and honor the life of this wonderful man.</paragraph>
