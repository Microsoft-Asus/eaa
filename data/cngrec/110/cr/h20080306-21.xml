  <narrative>AIR FORCE TANKER DECISION -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1399]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, even before the Air Force announced its decision on a new tanker, serious questions were being raised about the fairness of the process and the justification of the outcome. Barely a week later, it is becoming increasingly clear that the United States Air Force has called an air strike on U.S. jobs, U.S. companies, and a level playing field. That is grounds for a reduction in rank. You can't tell Boeing you want a 767-size tanker, then change your mind, and  then deny them the ability to fairly compete with the Triple-7. As it stands, the Airbus won't even fit in our hangars. Maybe the biggest reason the Air Force has an aging tanker fleet is because it has a prehistoric process that ought to be rendered extinct like the dinosaurs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is about fairness, this is about selecting the right company to keep America strong, and it so happens the right company is Boeing. Boeing offers the best people, the best plane, and the best deal, but the Air Force shot them down with a botched decision that outsources our national defense to foreign companies. If they won't admit their mistake, Congress should do it for them. The U.S. tanker decision should be grounded because it is unsafe to fly.</paragraph>
