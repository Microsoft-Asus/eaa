  <narrative>COUNTY PAYMENTS FOR DESCHUTES COUNTY, OREGON -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2662]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. WALDEN of Oregon asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in Deschutes County, Oregon, 78 percent of the land is owned by the Federal Government. That's an area 50 percent larger than the State of Rhode Island. Yet the Federal Government has pulled the plug on its commitment to this central Oregon county, by allowing the county timber payments program to expire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A full 10 percent of Deschutes County's annual budget is comprised of county payments. Faced with the possibility of losing those funds, the county last year laid off employees and cut services in its road department. This year the county's grappling with a similar choice, lay off more employees, cut vital services, or find a balance of the two.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deschutes County Commissioner Dennis Luke said, "It's not only our roads that will take a hit. More importantly, it affects our ability to reduce the threat of wildfire, provide search and rescue services to folks who enjoy recreating on the vast stretches of federal lands."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All the while, the House has had a solution in waiting in <bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill>, a 4-year reauthorization, but its approval has been stymied by the Democratic leadership, which, for some reason refuses to allow it to come up for a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill> languishes while we name post offices, honor sports teams and rename roads. There's time for that, but not time to vote on <bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the health of rural America can find a spot somewhere tucked in among those priorities, and that the leadership will allow the House to vote to reauthorize county timber payments.</paragraph>
