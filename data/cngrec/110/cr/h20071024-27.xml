    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the achievements of one of my constituents, Mr. Deven Amin of Easton, Pennsylvania. Deven, a senior at the Blair Academy in Blairstown, New Jersey, recently raised $7,500 in local contributions for the Nyumbani Village Project in Kenya.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nyumbani Village, located a short distance from Kenya's capital, Nairobi, is a settlement where HIV/AIDS affected orphans are placed under the stewardship of elderly Kenyans in mutually beneficial family settings. Founded in 1992, the village today provides shelter, nutrition and education for roughly 160 orphans, over 100 of which are infected with HIV/AIDS, and 63 elderly adults. From infants to teenagers, these orphans represent nearly every tribe and ethnicity in Kenya.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past 2 years, Deven has twice traveled to Kenya to volunteer at Nyumbani, where he helped cultivate the village's farm, organize children's activities and assist families with various household duties. After witnessing firsthand the impact of this unique project on its many participants, Deven returned to Easton eager to share his experiences, enhance awareness of the global HIV/AIDS epidemic and generate local support for the continued development of the Nyumbani Village.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, Deven raised an astonishing $7,500 for the project through an ambitious letter-writing campaign that targeted local businesses and health care professionals. The funds gathered by Deven will be used to help construct a critical multipurpose hall in Nyumbani. This structure will provide necessary recreation space for children during times of inclement weather and serve as a gathering place for the entire Nyumbani community. Construction of the facility has been identified as a top priority  by the program's directors, who envision the settlement housing between 1,200 and 1,600 individuals in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While raising money, Deven also educated residents of the Lehigh Valley about the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS in Africa through various speaking engagements at local organizations. Recently, Deven spoke at the Palmer Township Kiwanis Clubs, and he will address an audience at a local Rotary International chapter in the near future. He also plans to host a chapel service at his high school in late November. Deven's desire to enhance local awareness of global HIV/AIDS through firsthand accounts  of his experience in Kenya is truly commendable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues today join me in recognizing the achievements of Deven Amin, whose selfless efforts will undoubtedly improve the lives of hundreds of Kenyan orphans impacted by HIV/AIDS. We are all extraordinarily proud of Deven. On behalf of myself and the people of the 15th Congressional District, I congratulate him and thank him once again for what he has done to help make this world a better place.</paragraph>
