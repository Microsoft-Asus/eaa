    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues, particularly the gentleman from Georgia, in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="3936">H.R. 3936</bill>, which names a postal facility in Cleveland, Georgia, after a fallen hero, Sergeant Jason Harkins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Introduced on October 23, 2007, <bill type="h" number="3936">H.R. 3936</bill> is sponsored by Congressman Nathan Deal, the Representative from Georgia's Ninth Congressional District and cosponsored by the entire Georgia delegation. Mr. Deal's measure, <bill type="h" number="3936">H.R. 3936</bill>, was reported from the Oversight Committee on January 29, 2008, by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This morning's postal-naming bill honoring Sergeant Jason Harkins brings to light the special story of a staunch soldier who, along with five of his comrades from the Army's 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division out of Fort Lewis, Washington, were tragically killed while serving our country nobly in the Baqubah region of Iraq. Sadly, none of the six soldiers killed in one of the deadliest attacks on the Fort Lewis unit lived to see his 30th birthday. Yet, as soldiers, Sergeant Jason Harkins and  his fellow servicemen, all of whom had entered active duty service within only the past 6 years, bravely placed their lives on the front line in allegiance and service to this great country of ours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the heart of this story is the subject of <bill type="h" number="3936">H.R. 3936</bill>, Sergeant Jason R. Harkins. Sergeant Harkins was only 25 years old and serving his second tour of duty in Iraq when he succumbed to wounds sustained from an improvised explosive device that detonated near his vehicle during combat operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of the northern Georgia town of Clarksville, Sergeant Harkins attended and graduated from the State's public school system before enlisting in the Army Reserve in 1999 and later volunteering for active duty service in December of 2002.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Described as a true God-fearing country boy, Sergeant Harkins proudly served over 3 years in the U.S. Army Reserves and is a recipient of the Bronze Star of Valor and the Purple Heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to these honors, Mr. Speaker, let us also pay tribute to the life of Sergeant Harkins and pass <bill type="h" number="3936">H.R. 3936</bill> and designate the Helen Highway Post Office Building in Cleveland, Georgia, in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to my distinguished colleague from the State of Georgia (Mr. Deal).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400099" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have the honor today to rise in support of the memory of Army Sergeant Jason Robert Harkins by dedicating the United States Post Office located in Cleveland, Georgia, as the Sgt. Jason Harkins Post Office Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Mr. Davis and the committee for bringing this bill to the floor. It is, indeed, a sad but true honor to be able to recognize Sergeant Harkins. He was a member of the United States Army 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division of Fort Lewis, Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While serving his second tour of duty in Iraq, 25-year-old Sergeant Harkins was killed by a roadside bomb along with five other members of his platoon during combat operations in Baqubah, Iraq. For his valiant service to our country, Sergeant Harkins' family was presented the Bronze Star award and the Purple Heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Sergeant Harkins was a 1999 graduate of Habersham Central High School in Georgia, served 3 years in the United States Army Reserves and was currently serving with the Stryker Brigade located at Fort Lewis when the attack occurred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Jason Harkins is survived by his wife, Emily Renee Cook Harkins of Tacoma, Washington, formerly of Gadsden, Alabama; mother and stepfather, Nancy and Allen Fritchey; father and stepmother, Bobby and April Harkins; brothers Matthew and Daniel Harkins; as well as stepsisters Katie, Clara, Nicole, Jennifer and Emily; stepbrother Scott; and several nieces and nephews.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today to pay tribute to Sergeant Harkins and to join my constituents of Cleveland, Georgia, in naming the Sgt. Jason Harkins Post Office Building. This honor will serve as a lasting reminder of his courage, valor, and the ultimate sacrifice which he paid for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to include for the Record a copy of a letter from Mayor Donald Stanley of the City of Cleveland, as well as a letter from the White County Board of Commissioners requesting and supporting this designation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>WHITE COUNTY, GEORGIA,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cleveland, GA, September 26, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CONGRESSMAN DEAL: As you are aware, recently our community suffered a tremendous loss. Sgt. Jason Harkins lost his life at 25 years of age by a roadside bomb while serving in Iraq. Weeks before his death, Sgt. Harkins went into a danger zone and saved the life of one of his soldiers. A bullet actually struck him in his helmet during the rescue. For this act of valor, his family was presented the Bronze Star Award and Purple Heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jason gave the ultimate price for our community and nation. As a memorial to him, we support the Postmaster Louise S. Nix's request to pursue the act of having our postal facility in Cleveland renamed the Jason Harkins Postal Facility. As we understand it, this would in no way change the addresses of residents, but would show respect and memorialize a White County native who died for his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We would appreciate any assistance you could give to this action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chris R. Nonnemaker,</paragraph>

As a memorial to him, the City of Cleveland would like to ask you to pursue the act of having our postal facility in Cleveland renamed the Jason Harkins Postal Facility, understanding this would in no way change the addresses of residents but would show respect and memorialize a White County native who died for his country. Renaming a postal facility is a fairly common practice for military personnel who have lost their lives. The post  office facility in most towns is the only federal building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jason entered into service on December 16, 2002. He was killed in action on May 6, 2007. Jason was 25 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jason attended White County Schools, Cleveland was his address of record, both Jason's mother, Nancy Fritchey, and father, Bobby Harkins, are residents of Cleveland and White County with roots going very deep and strong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would appreciate any assistance you could give to this action. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, born in Fort Campbell, Kentucky on September 29, 1981, SGT Jason Harkins was a 1999 graduate of Habersham Central High School. His commitment to military service began at an early age. When he was a young boy, he used to run around with toy guns and swords practicing to become the Army man his father was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Campbell served three years in the U.S. Army Reserve and was currently serving with the Striker Brigade, Second Infantry Division based out of Fort Lewis, Washington. He never wanted to be called a hero because he believed he was just an ordinary person doing extraordinary things. Campbell however, was a hero. He proved he was a hero when he survived a roadside bomb during his first tour in Iraq. He proved he was a hero when he rescued a wounded soldier while they were under fire during  his second tour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And sadly, he proved he was a hero on May 6, 2007, when he and five other men in his platoon were killed when a makeshift bomb exploded near their vehicle. Sergeant Harkins was only 25 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His decorations include the Bronze Star of valor and the Purple Heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Harkins leaves behind a large family and a wife who will always remember him as a "true country boy" who found the best in every situation and could always make those around him smile.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us pay our respects to Sergeant Jason Harkins and remember his commitment to serving this Nation by naming the post office located at 116 Helen Highway in Fort Lewis, Washington, in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time and urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.</paragraph>
