    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the 2007 recipients of the New Hampshire Excellence in Education Awards. These prestigious awards, commonly called the EDies, are presented each year to individuals and schools who demonstrate the highest level of excellence in education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The EDies were founded as a way to honor the best of the best among New Hampshire's educators. In the 14 years since, there has been a rich source of talented and successful teachers, administrators, schools, and school boards to draw from to honor at each annual event. This year was no exception.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those individuals selected have been compared against a criteria set by others in their discipline through their sponsoring organization. Schools are also chosen by experienced educators and community leaders in New Hampshire based on guidelines established by the New Hampshire Excellence in Education Board of Directors. I am proud to recognize the individuals and schools who will receive this year's awards on June 9, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I would also like to recognize the many teachers who have played such an important role in my children's lives and in my own life, as well. As I serve in the Senate, I remain proud and grateful for the excellent education I received in the public education system of the State of New Hampshire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask that the list of the 2007 New Hampshire Excellence in Education Award winners be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
