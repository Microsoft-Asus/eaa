  <speaking speaker="400285" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of Dr. Pascal Spino of Greensburg, Pennsylvania, a remarkable physician.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After serving 60 years as a pediatrician, Dr. Spino is retiring after this long career. In 1954, he founded the first well baby clinic in Westmoreland County, which provides free exams and immunizations to children up to 6 years old. In 1972, Dr. Spino started the Render Any Needy Child Help program to provide medical care for abused children. He then went on to create a Level II nursery and modern pediatric department at Westmoreland Regional Hospital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Spino has received a number of recognitions, including Dr. Spino Day in Westmoreland County, for his lifetime commitment to helping others. More than 4,000 people were in attendance, despite a downpour of rain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. Spino's career, personal sacrifice, and devotion to improving our health care system and helping children.</paragraph>
