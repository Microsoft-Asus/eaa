    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a very special American, Mayor Dorothy Geeben, for her incredible service to her community and to wish her a very happy 100th birthday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Geeben moved to the town of Ocean Breeze Park, a small community on the Indian River, in 1952, and has been a cornerstone of that community ever since. In 1960 she joined the Ocean Breeze Town Council, serving as its president for 31 years, and in 2001 she became the mayor of the town and its 1,000 residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, as Mayor Geeben celebrates her 100th birthday, she is also recognized as the oldest mayor in America.  As mayor, her duties include presiding over town council meetings and signing documents. But to the residents of her village, she is known as a friend to everyone and as the woman who always has a smile on her face. Mayor Geeben has seen her small community through a lot in the last 40 years, including two major hurricanes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to recognize such a vibrant and dedicated woman. On behalf of Florida's 16th Congressional District, I would like to express my gratitude to Mayor Geeben for her many years of service to our community, and to wish her another happy 100 years.</paragraph>
