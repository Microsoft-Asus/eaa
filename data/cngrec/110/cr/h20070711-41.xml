    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 100th anniversary of the University of Central Arkansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Central Arkansas has gone by a handful of different names over the years, but its strong commitment to higher education has remained consistent. The University of Central Arkansas had its humble beginnings in 1907 as the Arkansas State Normal School with only 105 students. The school started as an entity only to train teachers, but now that school has diversified in a way that its founders would be proud of. The University of  Central  Arkansas now has 100 undergraduate courses of study, 33 master's degrees programs, and three doctoral programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Central Arkansas enrolls students from each county in Arkansas, students from 35 States, and students from 55 foreign countries. With current enrollment of over 12,000, the University of Central Arkansas has conferred more than 52,000 degrees in its 100-year history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am glad to see another outstanding educational institution continuing to serve those who wish to advance their education. I would like to thank my colleagues from Arkansas for bringing this resolution to the attention of the House of Representatives. I urge my colleagues to resoundingly pass this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="436">H. Res. 436</bill>, a resolution congratulating the University of Central Arkansas as it celebrates the 100th anniversary of its founding on May 14. I would like to thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Snyder) for introducing this resolution in recognition of the contributions the University of Central Arkansas has made to the education of citizens of our Nation and around the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The university enrolls over 12,000 undergraduate and graduate students, 90 percent of whom are full-time students, and 54 percent of whom receive financial aid. With more than 100 degrees to choose from, students have a wide range of academic opportunities. In the 2005-2006 academic year, the university awarded 1,286 undergraduate and 324 master's degrees to its students. The university's faculty of over 600 full- and part-time professors ensures an average student-to-faculty ratio of 19 to one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Enrollment has continued to grow at the University of Central Arkansas. Total enrollment increased 8.9 percent in the spring of 2006 due in part to a 26.6 percent increase in total first-time entering freshmen. Graduate enrollment has also made impressive gains, increasing 51.5 percent over the past 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Central Arkansas is nationally recognized for its strong academic programming. This year, the magazine U.S. News and World Report ranked the College of Business Administration at the University of Central Arkansas as one of the best graduate schools in the country. Its undergraduate honors college, established in 1982, has been perceived by the State and Nation as a highly innovative, model program. In fact, numerous universities throughout the country have sought the University  of Central Arkansas' guidance in the creation of similar programs to challenge students to read, write and analyze more critically in preparation for excellence upon graduation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The university's theater program is also nationally recognized by the National Association of Schools of Theater for meeting professional standards of quality in theater education and training, as set forth by the association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Central Arkansas proudly participates in 15 NCAA Division I varsity sports and is a member of the Southland Conference. More than 300 dedicated male and female student athletes participate in the conference, which competes against schools in Texas and Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to congratulate all of the students, alumni, and past and present employees on all they have accomplished over the last 100 years at the University of Central Arkansas. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, pending before the House today is <bill type="hr" number="436">H. Res. 436</bill>, recognizing the 100th anniversary of the University of Central Arkansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every citizen of Conway, Arkansas, and Faulkner County, Arkansas, takes great pride in the long history of contribution of UCA to our Nation. Noteworthy in this year of celebration is the fact that UCA currently has more than 100 undergraduate courses of study, 33 master degree programs, and three doctoral programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Noteworthy also is the fact that UCA currently serves over 12,300 students from all 75 counties in Arkansas, from 35 States, and over 55 countries. Over 52,000 students have graduated from UCA throughout its history, including 1,008 in the spring of 2007. UCA established one of the Nation's first honors colleges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The history of UCA is an interesting one. On May 14, 1907, State Senator Otis sponsored legislation establishing the Arkansas State Normal School. Many of UCA's buildings were built during the Great Depression. After the United States entered World War II, the administration of UCA offered the military its physical plant to assist in the training of military personnel. The president of UCA, Dr. Nolen Irby, and chairman of the UCA board visited Washington and made the offer, and the military agreed.  Soon after the offer was accepted, UCA, at that time being called the Arkansas State Teachers College, became home to temporary branches of the Army Reserves, the Naval Cadets, and the Army Air Reserve. And for a short time, the headquarters of the Arkansas National Guard Unit, the 153rd Infantry, was housed on its campus. The Naval cadets and Army Air Reservists were trained in courses related to aviation and took their flying instruction at the local airport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The largest contingent on campus was the Women's Army Corps Branch No. 3. WAC Branch No. 3 was home to 1,800 women between March of 1943 and March 1944. It was one of seven temporary WAC branches in the Nation. The WACs were trained to take the place of a male who was in a noncombat position. They were housed in Bernard Hall and would arrive in classes every 6 to 8 weeks in groups of varying numbers. The first classes were the largest and numbered close to 300. Toward the end of their training  in the winter of 1943 and 1944, each class numbered less than 100.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were so many military personnel on the campus of Arkansas State Teachers College in 1943 and 1944 that the Governor of the State, Homer Adkins, wanted to change the name of Arkansas State Teachers College to MacArthur Military College. However, the president of the campus, Dr. Nolen Irby, convinced Governor Adkins that the military personnel on campus would be temporary and the college would return to normal when the war was over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While all of the military units mentioned above were training on the Arkansas State Teachers College campus, the college continued to serve as an institution of higher education and educate those students enrolled in classes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Apparently, Arkansas State Teachers College did its job well in educating military personnel. Out of 85 colleges in the Nation engaged in war-training programs, Arkansas State Teachers College ranked seventh overall. In aviation, aerology and ship recognition, ASTC was first in the Nation, and third in the Nation in navigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the distinguished alumni that have graduated from UCA: Dr. Wesley Burks was the 2005 UCA Distinguished Alumnus. He is now professor and head of the Division of Allergy and Immunology in the Department of Pediatrics at Duke University Medical School;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ray Simon, the 2006 UCA Distinguished Alumnus, is the current Deputy Secretary of Education and plays a pivotal role overseeing and managing the development of policies, recommendations and initiatives that help define a broad, coherent vision for achieving the President's educational priorities, especially No Child Left Behind;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill Stiritz, the 2004 Distinguished Alumnus, was the CEO of Ralston Purina Company from 1982 to 1997 and is still on their board;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Monte Coleman, the Distinguished Alumnus of 1999, was a football walk-on in 1975 because of very little high school ball due to an injury and went on to play 16 seasons with the Washington Redskins and was a pivotal part of three of the Redskins' Super Bowl victories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In 1996, a distinguished alumnus was Scotty Pippin. He actually graduated in December 2001. He was one of the most versatile and talented players in  basketball and was a big part of the Chicago Bulls' six NBA championship teams in the 1990s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to recognize the current president, Lu Hardin, for all the work that he is currently doing to make UCA one of the great, great institutions currently in higher education in the United States, and we all look forward to the 200th anniversary, 100 years from now.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Davis).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Kentucky for yielding, and although I'm from Illinois, it's via Arkansas, and so I'm pleased to be here this evening to join with my colleagues to recognize the tremendous accomplishments achieved and, even more importantly, the tremendous legacy created by the University of Central Arkansas. Founded as a Normal School in 1907, it has since fervently and continuously striven towards greatness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Central Arkansas is a place where knowledge is not just about completing assignments or attending classes but, rather, a place where knowledge comes to light. With a tradition of exceptional administration, faculty and students, Central Arkansas manages to simultaneously create the nurturing environment for its over 10,000 students, all the while challenging them to achieve and maintain excellence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Central Arkansas enrolls students from every county in Arkansas, from 35 States and from 55 foreign countries. With a current enrollment that exceeds 12,000 students, the University of Central Arkansas has conferred over 52,000 degrees in its 100 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague from Arkansas, Representative Snyder, mentioned many of the accomplished individuals who have attended and graduated from the University of Central Arkansas, and the one that I happen to know best is Scotty Pippin, who grew up 12 miles from where I grew up, and where, at the time that I was growing up, there wasn't a high school for Scotty Pippin in his small town of Hamburg, Arkansas. But Scotty was able to go to the University of Central Arkansas, distinguish himself as  an outstanding athlete, and then, like many others, made their way from the Arkansas delta, and places similar to it, to Chicago, where he helped to make the Chicago Bulls a namesake, not only throughout America but throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The thing about Central Arkansas that many people don't know is that it has a strong program of recruiting and helping to nurture minority students and to try and make absolutely certain that they achieve and excel. And so it is for this reason that I'm pleased to commend my colleague, Representative Snyder, for introducing this resolution, commend the University of Central Arkansas, and like Vic, I would hope that they have another 100 years of great achievement and accomplishment.</paragraph>
