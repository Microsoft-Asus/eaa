    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this afternoon we will hear from General David Petraeus on the Iraq progress report. He is going to tell us what worked, what hasn't, and what needs to be done. And Congress should listen to the general and to Ambassador Crocker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My position is that we should have been listening all along to our commanders and leaders on the ground, and the testimony from General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker should be heard without prejudice. They are men of impeccable credentials, and it is troubling that the antiwar liberals are already moving en masse to discredit and dismiss the testimony without even hearing a single word of what they have had to say.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The debate over the surge should be over. While much remains to be done in Iraq, there is evidence that the surge is working and stabilizing that country and improving the security situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the consequences of failure in Iraq are monumental. A failure in Iraq will embolden al Qaeda. They will use the nation as a launching pad for attacks. Iran will move in and fill that void. It is a monumental day in the war on terror. We should approach it with an open mind.</paragraph>
