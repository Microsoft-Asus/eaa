    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) for yielding, and a special thank you to Mr. Waxman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be here today in support of a resolution that I have reintroduced that would promote the goals and ideals of creating a day in honor of the women of America's suffragist movement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The goal of this resolution is to recognize the anniversary of the inaugural women's rights convention in Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848. The suffragists are role models who inspired an entire generation and continue to inspire generations of young American women, just as they have two young women from the State of Nevada, Hannah Low and Destiny Carroll, who started their own petition drive to pay tribute to the efforts of these great suffragists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hannah Low and Destiny Carroll presented a petition to me with hundreds of signatures from their fourth grade class in support of creating a day to recognize the achievements of our brave suffragists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot tell you how proud I am of Hannah and Destiny, and I thank them for serving as an inspiration for this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While it may seem unbelievable to us now, it was not that long ago that women did not have the right to vote in our great Nation. On July 19, 1848, the first public appeal for women's suffrage was made, and a new movement was born for equality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We owe these suffragists a debt of gratitude for their efforts in their fight to give women the right to vote and to be full participating members in our Nation's political process. I hope that recognizing the anniversary of the inaugural women's rights convention in 1848 will keep alive the memory of the struggle to win the fundamental right, the right to vote, for women. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to imagine a time when our Nation's women did not have the privilege to vote. Thankfully, we have moved past those times to where we currently have the highest number of female Members in the history of the Congress. Although I think it is very difficult for people to realize, in the history of this Congress, we have had only 249 women, and 90 of them are serving now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, the struggle for women to achieve this came at great sacrifice. The fight lasted over many decades because of dedicated perseverance of many women. These pioneers were revolutionary in their fight for equality. They worked tirelessly knowing there would be a future when women were seen as equal to men with the ability to vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The historical Seneca Falls Convention, held in 1848, was led by a group of innovative women, including Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Following the convention, they formed the National Woman's Suffrage Association and the American Woman's Suffrage Association which merged together in 1890. Through public speeches, marches, parades, pickets, arrests and even hunger strikes, the members of the associations fought their battle across the country. Their historic efforts came to fruition  on August 18, 1920, when the Congress ratified the 19th amendment of the Constitution thereby granting women the right to vote. The goal of the suffragist movement endured over 50 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Schools around the world teach their students the rich history of the movement, and it is with pleasure that we promote continued awareness through a National Suffragists Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentlewoman from Nevada for introducing this legislation. It is amazing and we would never believe that women only have had the right to vote since 1920. It obviously means we have come a long way as a result of women's suffrage. We now have a woman who is the Speaker of the House of Representatives, which represents movement and progress.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for <bill type="hc" number="105">H. Con. Res. 105</bill>, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of a National Suffragists Day. This resolution promotes awareness of the women's suffragist movement and the brave individuals who fought to make the right to vote a reality for all women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleague, Representative Berkley, for sponsoring this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The women's suffragist movement has a long history in America. Today it may seem hard to believe, but less than one hundred years ago, women did not have the right to vote in federal elections in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National Suffragists Day would honor women such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who together founded the National Woman Suffrage Association in 1869.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These two leaders, along with other courageous women such as Lucretia Mott, Alice Paul, Paulina Kellogg Wright Davis, and countless other brave Americans, fought tirelessly to achieve their God-given rights to freedom and opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have introduced legislation of my own to posthumously honor Alice Paul and raise awareness of her powerful contributions to the suffragist movement and American society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, due to the sacrifice, hard work, and diligence of women like Alice Paul, the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified in the summer of 1920, giving women the right to vote on a national level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While today's resolution honors some great Americans of the past, it also provides us with an opportunity to look at the current state of women in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have come a long way as a nation since the summer of 1920. My home state of California is represented by two female Senators. We have a woman serving as Speaker of the House of Representatives, and a very strong female presidential candidate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Still, there is much more that needs to be done. Inequalities in pay, health care discrepancies, and a lack of good and affordable childcare still haunt many women in the United States today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must remain vigilant. We must ensure that all Americans have an equal opportunity for success and happiness. With that in mind, I urge my colleagues to cast a vote for honoring and increasing awareness of suffragists in America, and support <bill type="hc" number="105">H. Con. Res. 105</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hc" number="105">H. Con. Res. 105</bill>, supporting goals and ideals of a National Suffragist Day to promote awareness of the importance of the women suffragists who worked for the right of women to vote in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a woman who has not only enjoyed the privileges and responsibilities of voting, but also of serving my country in elected office, I am extremely proud to co-sponsor this resolution honoring those women who fought for my right, and the right of all women, to participate in the process of governing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill recognizes the tireless work and innovative ideas of women in particular. Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Sojourner Truth, Carrie Chapman Catt, Maud Wood Park, Lucy Burns, and Alice Paul were visionaries in their own times, and remain inspirations to us today. These seven women each challenged a system of male dominance, and asserted the role of women in politics and governance. Many of their methods of civil disobedience and peaceful protesting were taken up by the Civil  Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s, which expanded voting rights to even more of the population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>July 19th will be the anniversary of the first women's rights convention, held in Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848. To celebrate their accomplishments and raise awareness of the importance of the suffragists who fought for and won the right of women to vote in the United States, this bill designates July 19th as National Suffragists Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, any of these women would be amazed and proud to see an America where women are not only able to vote, but they are able to run for office. It is incredibly appropriate that this body, presided over by a woman for the first time in its history, should honor their work through a day set aside to raise awareness of their struggle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am especially pleased to support this resolution because it gives much deserved recognition to one of my heroes, Sojourner Truth, the great abolitionist and suffragist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1843, deciding her mission was to preach the word of God, Sojourner Truth--the name she gave herself as a traveling preacher who speaks the truth--left New York and traveled throughout New England, calling her own prayers meetings and attending those of others. She preached "God's truth and plan for salvation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After months of travel, she arrived in Northampton, Massachusetts, and joined the Northampton Association for Education and Industry, where she met and worked with abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, and Olive Gilbert.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we know, during the 1850s, slavery became an especially issue in the United States. In 1850, Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Law, which allowed runaway slaves to be arrested and jailed without a jury trial, and in 1857, the Supreme Court ruled in the Dred Scott case that those enslaved had no rights as citizens and that the government could not outlaw slavery in the new territories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While traveling and speaking in states across the country, Sojourner Truth met many women abolitionists and noticed that although women could be part of the leadership in the abolitionist movement, they could neither vote nor hold public office. It was this realization that led Sojourner to become an outspoken supporter of women's rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1851, she addressed the Women's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio, delivering her famous speech "Ain't I a Woman?" The applause she received that day has been described as "deafening." From that time on, she became known as a leading advocate for the rights of women. Indeed, she was one of the nineteenth century's most eloquent voices for the cause of anti-slavery and women's rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was to give proper recognition to her contributions to the struggle to abolish slavery and secure equal rights for women that I introduced <bill type="h" number="4510">H.R. 4510</bill> which would direct the Joint Committee on the Library to accept the donation of a bust depicting Sojourner Truth and to display the bust in a suitable location in the Capitol. In February of this year, that legislation became law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support <bill type="hc" number="105">H. Con. Res. 105</bill>, and I urge my colleagues to join me in doing so.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, <bill type="hc" number="105">H. Con. Res. 105</bill>.</chair>
