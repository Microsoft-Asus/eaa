    <paragraph>Mr. President, almost 40 years ago, the Ramah Navajo School Board was incorporated in New Mexico as a means to provide education, health, job training, and social services to the Ramah Navajo people. This private, not-for-profit group was created in 1970 and has since strengthened the community through its involvement. As they have done for the past 15 years, the School Board organizes a fair and rodeo as a celebration of Ramah Navajo culture and the culture of New Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To name a few of the events this year, there is a Pow Wow, kid's carnival, traditional dance performances, and roping competitions. I want to recognize the Ramah Navajo School Board, Inc., and their efforts to promote these public events, specifically the landmark of the 15th annual Ramah Navajo Fair and Rodeo. These events strengthen bonds in the community with the people and their traditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of their location and separation from the contiguous Navajo Nation, the Ramah Navajo community stands on a mission of self-determination and self-reliance, setting up programs like the School Board to deal with all their people's needs. The Ramah Navajo School Board helped create the first Indian-controlled contract school in the United States, currently educating 600 students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to bring to the attention of the country how the Ramah Navajo people have kept their cultural identity strong while building on their community through events like this fair and rodeo.</paragraph>
