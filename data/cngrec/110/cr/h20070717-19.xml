    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 25th anniversary of Operation Smile, a worldwide children's medical charity headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia, that repairs cleft lips and cleft palates for children and young adults in developing countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded in 1982 by Dr. William Magee, Jr., a plastic surgeon, and his wife, Kathleen, a nurse and clinical social worker, Operation Smile has grown from humble beginnings into a worldwide children's medical charity whose network of medical volunteers are dedicated to helping improve the health and lives of children worldwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Operation Smile has helped more than 100,000 children and young adults in 30 developing countries overcome their physical irregularities. The organization now operates one of the world's largest volunteer networks, utilizing more than 5,000 medical and nonmedical professionals around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the Magees for their passion to improve the health and lives of children and young adults worldwide. Through Operation Smile, their efforts over the past 25 years have offered new life and new hope to those suffering from facial deformities.</paragraph>
