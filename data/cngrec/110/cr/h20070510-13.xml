    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we are at the point where no one should call the war in Iraq "Bush's war." It is ours, America's war. We are in this together. We Democrats need the Republicans if we are to end it without a failed Iraqi state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not just about "getting out of Iraq." It should be about redeploying out of Iraq so that we can better ensure U.S. security elsewhere, as we leave Iraq with relative stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution we will soon vote on is today's stalking horse, with merit, but with less of a strategic plan for a successful end than the last Iraqi resolution, despite times that are now more dire in Iraq and, therefore, also for us. We need both the Republicans and a new strategy so that we can successfully end this conflict for our betterment. I see the key as President Bush's statement that our commitment is not open-ended. We, therefore, now need to define how to end it, together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will vote for this resolution, but I am expressing my reservations because it lacks defining how to achieve the end of an open-ended commitment by a winning strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why we need the Republicans, and they us, to resolve the war successfully by a strategy that deliberately defines the end of our open-ended commitment so that we can then use it to exact success, diplomatically, regionally, ensuring our, and Iraqis', greater security.</paragraph>
