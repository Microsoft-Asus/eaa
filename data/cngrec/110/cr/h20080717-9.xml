  <speaking speaker="412208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my friend, Jerry Northey, on his retirement after 12 years as president of UAW Local 838, and after 36 years of working at John Deere in Waterloo. Jerry has served four terms as president of the local 838 in my hometown, making him the longest-serving president in the local's history. In fact, he served as president more than twice as long as any of his predecessors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As president of Local 838, with over 3,000 members, the largest union local in Iowa, Jerry has been a strong and effective advocate for workers. Under his leadership, the local has seen a net gain of more than 500 jobs over the life of the current contract. Thanks to Jerry's leadership, the union and John Deere have successfully settled every collective bargaining agreement since 1987.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jerry has also led corporate ventures between John Deere and the UAW, including recently coming together to raise an impressive $1 million for the Cedar Valley United Way campaign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that Jerry will be greatly missed at the local hall and at John Deere, and I would like to thank him for his tremendous service, congratulate him on his many accomplishments, and wish him the best of luck in his retirement.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
