  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to share with my colleagues a recent speech by Michael Kaiser, the president of the Kennedy Center. Mr. Kaiser is an impressive and highly respected national leader in arts policy and advocacy. Last month, he addressed the National Press Club and spoke about the importance of cultural development and exchange.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his role as the president of our national performing arts center, Mr. Kaiser serves as a cultural ambassador for the administration. He has traveled around the globe to assist cultural organizations in many countries--including Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia. Cultural diplomacy is an effective part of our Nation's outreach to other countries and cultures, and Mr. Kaiser's role is an impressive part of that effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is an articulate and visionary leader for the Kennedy Center and a  major national resource. I believe his address to the National Press Club last month will be of interest to all of us, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed at this point in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
