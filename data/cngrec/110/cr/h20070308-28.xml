  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, after waiting for months, the new Democrat majority has introduced their plan for Iraq today, and it can be summed up with one phrase, fully funded withdrawal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seeking to micromanage the war, the Democrats have come up with a plan that attaches strings to troop funding in order to seek American withdrawal from Iraq by 2008. This Democrat plan for a fully funded withdrawal could also be described as a well-equipped retreat. A fully funded withdrawal might well be added to that classic list of American oxymorons that includes plastic glass and jumbo shrimp.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since their election pledge to "fix the war," it has taken our friends on the other side of the aisle 4 months to come up with a strategy in Iraq. But even though their proposal does include funding for our soldiers in the field and our veterans here at home, their latest poll-tested approach for fighting the war in Iraq can best be described as cut and run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all the Democrats' furtive back-room efforts and tortured explanations, it is not nearly as complex as they describe. In fact, their strategy could be described by George Orwell: "The quickest way to end the war is to lose it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't need a fully funded withdrawal. We need to fully fund victory for freedom in Iraq.</paragraph>
