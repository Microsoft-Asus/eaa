    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to a proud son of Sparta, North Carolina, country singer and Grand Ole Opry legend, Del Reeves. Del Reeves passed away after a long and painful battle with emphysema on New Year's Day 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Del Reeves was born in 1933 and was named Franklin Delano Reeves after Franklin Delano Roosevelt who was nominated to be the Democratic Presidential candidate just a few days before his birth. Del was a driven individual who knew at a very young age that he wanted to be a performer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a young child, Del spoke of music on the radio and said, "I listened on the radio on Saturday nights and it was the ultimate," referring to the Grand Ole Opry. "As a child, I told my daddy I was going to sing on the Opry one day. He said, `Yeah, sure you are.' I kept my goal in mind and in '66 we achieved it." He was one of the select members of the Grand Ole Opry for 40 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Del achieved that goal and many others. From a very young age, Del would borrow his brothers' instruments, and by the time Del had turned 12 years old, he had become a local radio star on WPAQ in Mount Airy on the "Merry Go Round Show," a program which is still aired today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>But this was just a start for Del Reeves. He went on for years performing and recording numerous hits, including 55 charted hits, two of them in the top 10.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Del was just more than a performer. He attended what is now Appalachian State University and served in the Air Force at Travis Air Force Base, where he wrote a number of his songs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Del was very dedicated to his hometown and the advancement of others. He started the Del Reeves Scholarship Fund, and for 10 years came back to Alleghany for the "Del Reeves Homecoming," where he held concerts to benefit the scholarship fund he set up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am so proud that Del, a Sparta native, was successful in his performing career, yet never lost touch with his roots and never let go of his dedication to helping others. Del had a wonderful career that spanned over 40 years. Beyond being a member of the elite group of the Grand Ole Opry, Del also wrote and performed a number of hit songs and appeared in eight movies, including "Sam Whiskey," starring Bert Reynolds and Clint Walker. Del also worked in television, hosting a TV program called  the "Del Reeves' Country Carnival."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of Del's greatest hits were "The Belles of the Southern Belle," his first hit in 1963; "The Girl on the Billboard," his number one billboard hit; "Sing a Little Song of Heartache," which he wrote with his wife; and "Looking Through the Windshield," his trucker anthem released in 1965.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other notable hits that charmed and thrilled country music fans were hits such as "Women Do Funny Things to Me," "Good Time Charlie's," "Be Glad" and the "Philadelphia Fillies." In addition, Del wrote many songs for country legends such as Carl Smith, Roy Drusky, Rose Maddox and Sheb Wooly. Del enjoyed performing lighter material as well as singing ballads, and he reflected on that saying, "Under this clown's face, there's a serious guy ..... I've been clowning as long as I can  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H1173]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When asked how he would like to be remembered, he said, "I want to be remembered as a great showman and a nice guy ..... that's all I could hope for." That is exactly what Del got, as he certainly is remembered as a nice guy and a great showman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of his closest friends, J.D. Higgins, appropriately commented that on New Year's Day country music lost a tremendous entertainer, and I will miss him greatly. He will be missed by country music fans all over the world. I know he will be missed by family, friends and his numerous admirers. Del was a true inspiration who made his hometown friends and North Carolina proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Del Reeves showed his large heart and love for his hometown community by creating a scholarship fund and always coming home to perform in Alleghany. Del's contributions will serve as a lasting testimony of his tremendous talent, kindness, motivation and delightful personality. We will all miss Del Reeves but know that his timeless music will never be forgotten. He leaves quite a legacy for fans and future generations.</paragraph>
