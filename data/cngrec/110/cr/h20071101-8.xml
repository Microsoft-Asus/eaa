  <narrative>REAL SOLUTIONS FOR IRAN -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12387]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400097" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 45 years ago, President Kennedy compelled the Soviet Union to remove offensive missiles from Cuba without a shot being fired. The Soviet missiles represented a true threat, but President Kennedy knew that the consequences of war were severe and that there was a viable option short of direct military confrontation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Iranian threat, while certainly a continuing and growing concern, cannot be compared to the danger of Soviet efforts during the Cold War. The President's perceived rush toward the possibility of military conflict with Iran highlights the executive's inability to find real solutions to preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons or supplying weapons to our adversaries in Iraq. We must exhaust every economic and diplomatic opportunity before even considering a military response.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This administration has reduced our leverage around the world, but there is still time to build an international consensus around this issue. Congress has a constitutional responsibility in this debate. I hope Members will urge the President to take the moral high ground and deal with Iran through  international pressure, not unilateral action.</paragraph>
