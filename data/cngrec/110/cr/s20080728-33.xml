  <narrative>RETIREMENT OF GENERAL RICHARD CODY -- (Senate - July 28, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="7571">S7571</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, after 36 years of service to our Nation, GEN Dick Cody will conclude his military career on August 1. I salute his leadership and honor his lovely wife Vicki, for her invaluable support of her husband and our soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dick Cody began his service more than 40 years ago, leaving his family's car dealership in Vermont and reporting to West Point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has served our Nation on battlefields and bases around the world, commanding our soldiers, including the famed Screaming Eagles of our 101st Airborne Division.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Cody's service as operations officer and later vice chief of staff, reminds me of GEN George C. Marshall's service as our Army's Chief of Staff during World War II. Marshall noted that before the war, he had "time" to prepare the Army, but "no money."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After France fell to the Nazis, Marshall said he had "money, but no time." Dick Cody faced similar circumstances and deserves our gratitude for preparing our soldiers to fight the war against terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Army entered this war with significant equipment shortages. Our forces were organized to fight the Cold War rather than the vastly different global war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since September 11, 2001, with funds provided by Congress, Cody has directed the fielding of 94 new Army equipment programs worth over $100 billion. He orchestrated the Army's largest restationing and construction program in 70 years. He directed the most sweeping transformation of our Army since the dawn of mechanized warfare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He oversaw the conversion of our Reserve components to a critical part of our operational forces, and supervised the addition of 65,000 new soldiers to our forces. He has also been instrumental in ensuring our wounded soldiers receive the treatment and care which they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vicki Cody supported her husband, and his soldiers, throughout their 33 years of marriage. She cared for our military families during training missions and deployments, often while her own husband was serving far from his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dick and Vicki raised two sons, Clint and Tyler, both U.S. Army captains, with six combat deployments between them. When young Dick Cody left Vermont, and Cody Chevrolet, he truly started a new "family business."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation is grateful for his leadership, and we wish him and Vicki all the best as they begin a new chapter of their lives.</paragraph>
