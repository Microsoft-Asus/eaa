  <speaking speaker="400054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, for the last 8 weeks, a group of Republican Senators, led by Senator Vitter, have come to the floor to talk about health care. Thus far Senators VITTER, THUNE, ISAKSON, and DEMINT have spoken about health care particularly the choice we are facing this November in electing our next President. I don't think there has ever been such a clear difference in opinions between parties on an issue that issue is health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One side would like the Government to run health care. The other side would like to give individuals and families the resources to access their own health care that they can control and take with them from job to job. In a nutshell--big government v. individual and family choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week I am responsible for talking about the most tangible area we see this dichotomy--Medicare. Under Medicare, beneficiaries either have fee-for-service or Medicare Advantage. The Government sets prices and makes coverage decisions under fee-for-service. Multiple private sector companies offer comprehensive coverage under Medicare Advantage. But the best example of individual choice and private sector competition is seen under Medicare's drug benefit--Part D. Let me first talk about Medicare  Advantage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2008, Medicare Advantage plans are offering an average of approximately $1,100 in additional annual value to enrollees in terms of cost savings and added benefits. Some examples of extra benefits available through Medicare Advantage plans are; No. 1, coordination of care; No. 2, special needs services; No. 3, predictability in out-of-pocket costs; No. 4, reduced cost-sharing for Medicare covered services; and No. 5, vision and dental benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Competition in the Medicare Advantage Program has created significant value for beneficiaries. Medicare Advantage enrollees typically benefit from reduced cost-sharing relative to FFS Medicare. All regional PPO enrollees have the protection of a required catastrophic spending cap and a combined Part A and B deductible. Sixty-seven percent of plans have coverage for eye glasses. Eighty-three percent have coverage for routine eye exams. Eighty-six percent cover additional inpatient acute care stay  days. Ninety percent waive the 3-day hospital stay requirement for skilled nursing facility care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Medicare Advantage plan enrollees also receive basic Part D prescription drug coverage at a lower cost than stand-alone Part D plans can provide. Enrollees in Medicare Advantage plans that include Part D coverage save money on drug coverage in two ways: No. 1, Medicare Advantage plan drug premiums for basic coverage in 2008 were, on average, about $6 less than average Part D premiums for basic coverage; and No. 2, the Medicare Advantage payment structure allows Medicare Advantage with Part  D to use rebates to further reduce Part D premiums. On average, Part D premium savings from rebates was more than $16 per month in 2008. In 2007 it was reported that 99 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have access to Medicare Advantage plans with zero added premiums, while 86 percent have access to plans that would cover prescription drugs with a zero premium through Medicare Advantage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some say Medicare Advantage is not needed because Medicare meets all the needs of the beneficiaries, but if this was true, millions of seniors would not purchase supplemental Medigap coverage to add benefits and pick up some costs. If Medicare Advantage plans were no longer available to those currently enrolled, 39 percent of the beneficiaries would go without supplementary coverage because they could not afford it. According to the NAACP, Medicare Advantage plans have been able to provide low  income beneficiaries more comprehensive benefits and lower cost-sharing than if they just had Medicare alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Medicare Advantage enrollees report on their experience in Medicare Advantage plans through the Consumer Assessment of Health Plan Survey, CAHPS. Scores from CAHPS are consistently high. Eighty-six percent of respondents give their plan a rating of 7 or higher, on a scale of 10. Ninety percent of respondents indicated that they usually or always received needed care. And 88 percent of respondents indicated that they usually or always received care quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said earlier, the greatest example of individual choice and private sector competition is found in Medicare Part D. The overall projected cost of the drug benefit is $117 billion lower over the next 10 years than was estimated last summer due to the slowing of drug cost trends, lower estimates of plan spending, and higher rebates from drug manufacturers. Compared to original Medicare Modernization Act projections, the net Medicare cost of the new drug benefit is $243.7 billion, or 38.5 percent,  lower over the 10-year period, 2004 to 2013.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ninety percent of Medicare beneficiaries in a stand-alone Part D prescription drug plan, PDP, will had access to at least one plan in 2008 with lower premiums than they were paying in 2007. In every State, beneficiaries had access to at least one prescription drug plan with premiums of less than $20 a month. The national average monthly premium for the basic Medicare drug benefit in 2008 is projected to average roughly $25. Seventeen organizations will offer stand-alone prescription drug plans  nationwide in 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beneficiaries had a wide range of plans from which to choose--some that have zero deductibles and some that offer other enhanced benefits, such as reduced deductibles and lower cost sharing. There also are options that cover generic drugs in the coverage gap for as low as $28.70 a month; nationwide, beneficiaries in any State can obtain such a plan for under $50 a month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consumer satisfaction with the Part D benefit is very high: Wall St Journal/Harris Interactive, December 2007--87 percent satisfied; VCR Research/Medicare Rx Network, November 2007--83 percent satisfied; KRC/Medicare Today, October 2007--89 percent satisfied; and 90 percent of dual eligible beneficiaries and 85 percent of beneficiaries with limited incomes are satisfied. Both the KRC and VCR survey show that satisfaction is increasing 10 to 12 percent over the past 2 years and that 65 percent  to 77 percent say that their Medicare plan is saving them money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our experience with the Medicare Advantage and Part D drug plan shows one thing--competition and choice works. Under Part D we have true competition--private plans bidding against one another and driving down the price of drug benefit packages to seniors. Seniors can go onto Medicare.gov and select the plan that best suits their needs for drugs, copays, pharmacy locations, and the overall premium. As I described earlier--premiums are more reasonable than we predicted and satisfaction is very  high--competition and choice works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under Medicare Advantage we have competition-lite. Plans compete for beneficiaries, but Medicare Advantage reimbursement is tied to Medicare fee- for-services rates in an area. People love to talk about how Medicare Advantage plans are reimbursed too much, but unfortunately that rally cry is based off a study that did not compare apples to apples. If you compare the cost of delivering Part A and B services alone, Medicare Advantage plans are only paid  2.8 percent more than Medicare FFS. I am comfortable paying 2.8 percent more because seniors have more choices, they receive more comprehensive benefits, and their care is coordinated under Medicare Advantage plans. Medicare Advantage plans actually match treatments with diseases and maintenance care with chronic conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Coburn and I want to move Medicare Advantage from competition-lite to full competition. We will be introducing a bill in the coming weeks that will force Medicare Advantage plans to truly compete against each other on price. Medicare Advantage plans already compete on service and quality under our bill they will have to taken lessons from Part D drug plans and compete on price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you have been listening from the beginning, you hopefully understand how effective competition and choice have been in two parts of the Medicare program. And you understand why I want that same robust health care competition and choice for every American. Every American deserves access to quality, affordable health care of their choice and competition between health care plans will help achieve that goal.</paragraph>
