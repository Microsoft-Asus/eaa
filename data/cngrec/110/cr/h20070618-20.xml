    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 142nd anniversary of Juneteenth Independence Day. On June 19, 1865, MG Gordon Granger and Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, with the news of the Emancipation Proclamation and the end of the Civil War. News of President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, did not reach the frontier areas of the United States, especially the Southwest, for almost 2 1/2  years. General Granger's General Order No. 3 on June 19, 1865, is recognized  as the day that all slaves in the United States were finally freed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Juneteenth has become recognized as a State, regional, and national event that honors the freeing of slaves in the United States. As Americans, we must never forget how precious freedom is. Juneteenth is the day that all Americans of all races, creeds and ethnic backgrounds can celebrate freedom and the end of slavery in the United States. Its historical significance should be regarded as a means of understanding the past and more effectively facing the challenges of the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the sponsor of <bill type="hc" number="155">H. Con. Res. 155</bill>, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation and urge President Bush to issue a proclamation observing Juneteenth Independence Day with appropriate ceremonies, activities and programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to imagine a time when national news took months and sometimes years to disseminate throughout the country. Today we get immediate news updates through various outlets. But it was over 2 years after President Lincoln gave the historical Emancipation Proclamation that the slaves of Galveston, Texas, learned that their long-deserved freedom had been won. It was on that date, June 19, 1865, when Union soldiers made their way southwest to spread the joyful news of their  Civil War victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every year on June 19, commonly known as Juneteenth Independence Day, African Americans in the Southwest and around the Nation celebrate their emancipation, their culture and the historic significance of the civil rights struggles. It is critical that we educate our children not only of American history and the Civil War, but the tradition of Juneteenth Independence Day. By taking time to celebrate these anniversaries, we honor the richness, diversity and heritage of all races that form our great  Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>June 19th is a time to acknowledge a period of history that helped shape our Nation and continues to influence our society today. It is with great honor that I support the passage of House Concurrent Resolution 155.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Idaho for his remarks and comments and for his support of this resolution. I also would just note that I attended a Juneteenth celebration in the neighborhood where I live on Saturday, and,  of course, they had speeches, poems, readings and historical proclamations that people did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To make sure that all Members of the House and of the Senate have an opportunity to participate in an observance, Senator Barack Obama and I are sponsoring an observance on tomorrow in the Gold Room in the House Office Building, and certainly would welcome all to attend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this concurrent resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for <bill type="hc" number="155">H. Con. Res. 155</bill>, "Recognizing the Historical Significance of Juneteenth Independence Day."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As someone who has spent more than a quarter of a century serving the people of Maryland's Fifth Congressional District in the House of Representatives, I have developed a profound appreciation for the hard work that goes into creating the laws of our land. However, it is not the passage of legislation or signing ceremonies with the President that I will remember most when my time here is done. Rather, it is seeing the way that our work positively impacts the lives of those we serve out in the  real world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why Juneteenth Independence Day holds such special significance for me. Because Juneteenth isn't a celebration of the Emancipation Proclamation itself, it is a commemoration of the day that Abraham Lincoln's historic decree finally accomplished what it was designed to do--abolish slavery in the United States forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Emancipation Proclamation took effect on January 1, 1863, it ended slavery in the Union states, but did nothing to outlaw the cruel and barbaric practice in the states loyal to the Confederacy. It wasn't until 2 1/2  years later--when Major General Gordon Granger landed at Galveston, Texas, with news that the Civil War was over, the United States was whole once again, and that all slaves in every part of our nation were now free--that the spirit of abolition was finally fulfilled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That day was June 19, 1865--and today, we mark the 142nd anniversary of the moment that freedom, equality and the unabated pursuit of happiness were extended to all citizens of the United States, regardless of race, religion or ethnicity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pride to join my colleagues in Congress--as well as Americans from all walks of life--in commemorating our country's oldest celebration of the abolishment of slavery, and in honoring all of the achievements and contributions of African Americans throughout our nation's history.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support <bill type="hc" number="155">H. Con. Res. 155</bill>, legislation commemorating a monumental day in the history of liberty, Juneteenth Independence Day. Juneteenth marks the events of June 19, 1865, when slaves in Galveston, TX, learned that they were at last free men and women. The slaves of Galveston were the last group of slaves to learn of the end of slavery. Thus, Juneteenth represents the end of slavery in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope all Americans will take the time to commemorate Juneteenth. Friends of human liberty should celebrate the end of slavery in any country. The end of American slavery is particularly worthy of recognition since there are few more blatant violations of America's founding principles, as expressed in the Declaration of Independence, than slavery. I am particularly pleased to join the recognition of Juneteenth because I have the privilege of representing Galveston.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Illinois for introducing this resolution, which I am proud to cosponsor. I thank the House leadership for bringing this resolution to the floor, and I urge all of my colleagues to honor the end of slavery by voting for <bill type="hc" number="155">H. Con. Res. 155</bill>.</paragraph>
