    <paragraph>S&#xC1;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in speaking out against the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement. This is not a choice between trade and protectionism. It is a choice between fair trade, which can benefit working families across the Nation, and unfair trade, which benefits the wealthiest few at expense of the rest of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot support, and I urge my colleagues not to support, this Bush-negotiated Peru Free Trade Agreement. It uses the same North American Free Trade Agreement model that has already failed working families here and abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I feel like I am at a used car lot and the dealer is trying to sell the American people a beat-up old lemon with a new paint job. Well, we learned with NAFTA that there are no refunds for the American people when they are sold a bad bill of goods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's learn from our mistakes and reject this Peru FTA junker. The American people deserve trade that works for working families, and the Peru FTA won't give us that. Vote "no" on the Peru FTA.</paragraph>
