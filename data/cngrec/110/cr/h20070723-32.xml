  <speaking speaker="400371" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me first express my appreciation to our colleague from the great State of New York (Mrs. Gillibrand) for introducing this important and timely resolution. I know the gentlelady from New York would like to be here, and if I speak very slowly may yet get here before we conclude, but whether she is here in person, she is certainly here in spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The little village of Lake Placid lived up to its name on two spectacular occasions in the last century. The 1932 Winter Olympics and the 1980 Winter Olympics were two of the most exciting events of our time, featuring the most beautiful backdrops in the history of the games.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The organizing committee of the 1932 Olympics faced an uphill battle, raising money for the games in the middle of the Great Depression. But symbolizing the American spirit of generosity, Dr. Godfrey Dewey donated land owned by his family to be used for the all-important bobsleigh run. In fact, the Winter Olympics that year became a real distraction from the Great Depression for all the residents of the State of New York, and, in fact, the entire world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In those 1932 Games, Eddie Eagan became the only Olympic athlete ever to win a gold medal in both the Summer and Winter Games. A great, versatile athlete, Eagan had already earned gold as a lightweight boxer in the 1920 Summer Games. At Lake Placid in 1932, he was part of the four-man bobsleigh team that triumphed in first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution takes the opportunity to congratulate and celebrate Lake Placid upon the 75th anniversary of the games it hosted in 1932. This town deserves full congressional credit for the efficiency and grace with which it represented the United States during the Games of 1932 and, again, in 1980.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Lake Placid outdid itself in 1980, when it had new facilities and a renewed spirit to host thousands of people for those Winter Games. Those Games became famous for the unbelievable Miracle-on-Ice conquest, when the United States hockey team, a group of amateurs and college kids, captured the hearts of the Nation by upending the Soviet Union's intimidating hockey machine in a dramatic 4-3 semifinal victory. They went on to win the gold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lake Placid's involvement with the Olympics has grown larger than just those two games. Lake Placid maintains world-class Olympic facilities and  serves as one of the United States Olympic Committee's three national training centers. The small town in Upstate New York continues to host international sporting events, as well as some 2.2 million tourists every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage Members to support the resolution recognizing Lake Placid's historic place in Olympic history and encouraging the USOC to select this idyllic town for future bids in the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games so long as they are not in competition with an applicant from the State of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong and unqualified support of <bill type="hr" number="521">H. Res. 521</bill>, no Indiana exceptions, at least not today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Representative Gillibrand, as my colleague from California did, for this important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For close to a century, Lake Placid has been central to America's participation and achievements in international sports. It's the only site in North America to have hosted more than one Winter Olympics, both in 1932 and in 1980.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, in 1980, and if you haven't seen the movie, it was the site of one of America's greatest moments, when the U.S. national hockey team defeated the heavily favored Soviet Union. Walt Disney films recently created an extraordinary motion picture remembering that miracle on ice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was not only a victory for one hockey team over another, but for millions it symbolized the triumph of freedom over tyranny and seemed to be a part of setting into motion in 1980 what we would see with the collapse of Soviet communism in 1991. It forced you out of that, so in a very real sense, Lake Placid is important in the history of freedom as well as in the history of sport. Indeed, countless Americans actually remember where we were in that glorious moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lake Placid's contributions to international sports continue to this very day. It's the home of one of the U.S. Olympic Committee's three national training centers and regularly hosts international sports competitions, bringing together athletes from across the globe to celebrate the excellence of sports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Perhaps above all, Mr. Speaker, Lake Placid is an example of what a society can accomplish. This small village in New York with a population of less than 2,700 not only is a venue for grand-scale sporting events but also welcomes over 2 million visitors every year. This resolution recognizes Lake Placid's place in Olympic history, encourages Americans to visit that village's state-of-the-art Olympic facilities, and further encourages the U.S. Olympic Committee to select Lake Placid to represent  the United States in the future for the Olympic or Para-Olympic games.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend my distinguished colleague from New York again, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mr. McHugh, for introducing this important resolution. I urge its adoption.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentlelady from New York (Mrs. Gillibrand).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412223" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I've offered <bill type="hr" number="521">H. Res. 521</bill> to celebrate Lake Placid's prominent place in Olympic history. This year marks the 75th anniversary of the 1932 Olympic Games and the beginning of Lake Placid's storied history in American hearts and minds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the midst of a worldwide depression, 252 athletes from 17 countries participated in the 1932 Winter Olympic Games held at Lake Placid. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose home is just a few hours south of Lake Placid in Duchess County, officially opened the third ever Winter Olympic Games and the first one ever held in the Western Hemisphere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite fierce competition from around the world, Lake Placid was once again chosen to host the Winter Olympic Games 48 years later, in 1980. This time, 1,072 athletes from 37 nations participated in the Games, and the question, "Do you believe in miracles?" forever became ingrained in the American consciousness. The American hockey team's victory over the Soviet Union permanently linked Lake Placid with one of the greatest triumphs, and prideful moments, in American sports history, with the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lake Placid, a small village in the Adirondacks, is the only location in North America to have hosted the Winter Olympic Games more than once. Their success is phenomenal, when one considers that fewer than 2,700 residents live in the village.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm so incredibly fortunate to represent the citizens of Lake Placid and Essex County. Every year, Mayor Jamie Rogers and the villagers of Lake Placid welcome over 2.2 million visitors from all 50 States and countries all over the world. Lake Placid has been one of my favorite vacation places since I was a child, and I still enjoy taking my son there every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly encourage all Americans to visit the state-of-the-art Olympic facilities in Essex County. The New York State Olympic Regional Development Authority, or ORDA, operates the various venues used in the 1932 and 1980 Olympic Games. Athletes from around the world come to Lake Placid to train and compete at these facilities, in addition to sports enthusiasts, young and old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Lake Placid is the home of one of three U.S. Olympic Committee's national training centers, an honor that allows upstate New York to mold the next generation of gold medal winners. The facilities at Lake Placid allow every American to step into the shoes of a professional athlete. It's thrilling to skate at the Herb Brooks Arena where the miracle on ice took place, or skate at the Olympic Speed Skating Oval where America's speed skater, Eric Heiden, won an unprecedented five gold  medals in 1980.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Visitors can try out the ski-jumping complex or sharpen their bobsled and luge skills. The beautiful Adirondack Mountains offer cross-county or alpine skiing on Whiteface Mountain, one of the top resorts in all the Nation, all with spectacular pristine views.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lake Placid admirably hosted the Olympic games twice in the past. I hope the U.S. Olympic Committee will consider having Lake Placid represent the United States in a future bid for the Winter Olympic Games.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the Village of Lake Placid as they celebrate the 75th anniversary of the 1932 Winter Olympic Games. I thank everyone in the House of Representatives for supporting this resolution that honors Lake Placid's continued distinguished place in American Olympic history.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join the gentlelady from New York, Ms. GILLIBRAND, in support of <bill type="hr" number="521">H. Res. 521</bill>, Celebrating the 75th Anniversary of the 1932 Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid, New York. This was truly a great moment in the history of sports. The beautiful Lake Placid-Wilmington region played host to athletes from around the globe and the event put the USA on the map of winter sports. The graceful Norwegian figure skater Sonja Henie won the second of her three gold  medals. American speed skater Jack Shea won two gold medals, a first for Olympic competition. The United States won 12 medals in all, the most in the competition. Ever since, the spirit and beauty of competitive winter sports have remained on display in Lake Placid, which played host to the United States' memorable 1980 hockey victory over the Soviet Union, and in countless skiing, skating, sledding and other events. We can all be proud of Lake Placid's rich history.</paragraph>
