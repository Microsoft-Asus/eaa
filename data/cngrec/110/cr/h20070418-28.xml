  <speaking speaker="412224" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, April 12, 32-year-old Utica police officer Thomas Lindsey was shot and killed in the line of duty during a routine traffic stop in Utica, New York, my hometown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A 5 1/2 -year veteran of the Utica police force, Tom served for more than a year with an elite squad tasked with handling special assignments. Tom was the kind of guy that, as a teenager, he traveled to Mexico one summer just to build churches. And prior to his tenure as a Utica police officer, he served our Nation honorably as a U.S. Marine as an embassy guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former district attorney, I had the distinct privilege of working hand in hand with the dedicated men and women of the Utica Police Department. This loss affects those brave men and women and their families hardest of all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom put his life on the line in the Marines and as a police officer, and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect his country and the community. Losing someone like Tom is a great tragedy, but in this tragedy there is a lesson. We must learn from the way Tom lived his life and his commitment to public service, his community and his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My prayers are with Tom's mother, Carmella Lindsey-Schisler, his girlfriend, Lisa, and his family and coworkers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope everyone can take a moment today to thank the men and the women in their local police departments who serve them so well.</paragraph>
