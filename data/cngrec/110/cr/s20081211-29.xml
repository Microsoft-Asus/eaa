  <narrative>AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY CRISIS -- (Senate - December 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10927">S10927</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, to all those within the sound of my voice, we have tried very hard to arrive at a point where we can legislate for the automobile industry. People have worked very hard. I believe everyone is working in good faith. I am terribly disappointed that we are not able to arrive at a conclusion, but I want to say in the most emphatic manner how much I appreciate Senator Chris Dodd. He has worked going into months now.  We had  the housing crisis, we had the bailout of the financial industry, and now the automobile industry. This man has worked day and night for months. Chris Dodd is one of America's great legislators. He has been here a long time. He is a veteran of the House and the Senate, and so I admire his patience and perseverance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His counterpart, Senator Shelby, and I served together in the House, and he hasn't been heavily involved in these negotiations, but I like Richard Shelby very much. One thing about Senator Shelby, you never have to guess where he stands on an issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last several days--and maybe I will be criticized by some on my side, but I doubt that--I have been extremely impressed with Bob Corker of Tennessee. Now, we weren't able, based on his good work, to arrive at something on which we could get enough Republicans to agree, but he did some wonderful work, and I think the work he did is going to pay dividends next year because even though this is a real loss--my personal feeling--for the country, that we are not going to be able to  do something, I think the manner in which we have proceeded, led by Senator Corker on the Republican side, has been extremely good. I repeat, I think it is going to work well next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a lot of work to do. We have issues like this we will be dealing with next year, and I think we have come to a point in the legislative process in the Senate that we have to start working together and not have one side say yes and one side say no. So I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle also recognize what Senator Corker has tried to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I certainly have no problem with others who disagreed with the approach we have taken, with the White House. This is not our proposal. We have worked with President Bush. President Bush is President of the United States--and everyone knows, you can read my book as to how I felt about the White House and what has happened--the White House has been extremely available. Josh Bolten and others in the White House have worked very hard with us to come up with an agreement, and we did, working with  the House Banking Committee, the Senate Banking Committee, as I have indicated, led by Senator Dodd. But we have not been able to get this over the finish line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So although we have worked and worked--and we could spend all night tonight, tomorrow, Saturday, and Sunday--we are not going to get to the finish line. That is just the way it is. There is too much difference between the two sides. All of us on this side of the aisle are in favor of the proposal that has been negotiated with the White House and the two banking committees, but we are not going to be able to vote on that more than likely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The procedure now that we have in the Senate is that 1 hour after we come in tomorrow morning, we can vote on cloture. And what are we voting on? It is a bill that we took from the calendar to be an instrument--it is a tax instrument because a lot of what we are doing with this banking matter involves the Finance Committee--and we would take that and move to proceed on that--cloture on that--and then as soon as we got cloture on that, we would amend it with our proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have indicated, we know we don't have 60 votes. There is no need to play around with that and cause undo hardship. So I have spoken to my friend, the distinguished Republican leader, and what we propose is that at about 10:30 or so tonight we will vote on cloture, just to show everybody where we are. Everybody should understand when this vote is over tonight--and I don't think we are going to get 60 votes--it is over with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I dread looking at Wall Street tomorrow. It is not going to be a pleasant sight. Millions of Americans, not only the auto workers but people who sell cars, car dealerships, and people who work on cars, are going to be directly impacted and affected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned earlier today, Christmas is approaching. This will be a very bad Christmas for a lot of people as a result of what takes place tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want my colleagues to know that I have expressed my opinion as to what I think should happen. There are many people who have been involved in this on the other side of the aisle who in good faith disagree with what I said, and I accept that and appreciate that. But I think the time for talking is over. We should vote and move on to something else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am happy to yield to my distinguished colleague, Senator McConnell.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this has been a challenging exercise for everyone involved on both sides. We all remember a couple of months ago we were called upon to rescue the American financial system. At the end of the day, after a few fits and starts, 74 out of 99 Senators present thought it was a good idea to do that. It was a vote we all proudly cast from our individual seats and most of us supported it. It was a broad, bipartisan vote, supported by the two Presidential candidates  as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we have moved into a very tricky and challenging area, and that is sort of industry-by-industry rescue. We have had before us the whole question of the viability of the American automobile manufacturers. None of us wants to see them go down, but very few of us had anything to do with the dilemma they have created for themselves. So the question was: Is there a way out? The administration negotiated in good faith with the Democratic majority a proposal that was simply unacceptable to the vast  majority of our side because we thought it, frankly, wouldn't work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Into this breach stepped the junior Senator from Tennessee who, I must say, has made an extraordinary impact in a very small amount of time. I am hard pressed to think of another Member who has been here such a short period of time who has made such an impression on colleagues on both sides of the aisle by mastering an extraordinarily complicated subject and being able to explain it in a way that is understandable. He has diligently pursued an agreement that could pass, that could enjoy broad  support on both sides. He has made great progress in that direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sticking point we are left with is the question of whether the UAW is willing to agree to a parity pay structure with other manufacturers in this country by a date certain. I understand their reluctance to do that, and so far, in the discussions Senator Corker and Senator Dodd and others have had, they have not been willing to give a date specific by which parity could be achieved. It is upon that issue that we have reached an impasse for the moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this stage I share the view of the majority leader that we should go ahead and have the vote on cloture to the measure he outlined. We can have it at 1 o'clock this morning or we could move it up and do it now. I will be happy, I say to my friend, the majority leader, to try to get the vote we could have at 1 o'clock at 10:30 or 10:40, if he wishes me to. I think that would probably end the discussion, at least for today. We all know we will be involved in this discussion in the future, but  that will probably end it for today.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="7005">H.R. 7005</bill> occur at 10:40. I ask consent that Senator Dodd, who has spent so much time on this, be given 10 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there is anyone who wishes to respond to that, they would have 10 minutes to do so.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>I say to my friend, I have to reserve the right to object for the moment. I think I have one Member with whom I have to check to see if he can get this done in the next few moments. I can think of no reason this would not be a good idea, but for the moment, I am going to have to object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>So we don't lose any time, let's move to Senator Dodd, and when you come back we will move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks for everyone's patience.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the distinguished majority leader and my colleagues. This has been a long ordeal. I know many of the conversations I have had over the last several days have been wondering when, if ever, we might come to a conclusion of what has been a lengthy process over the last 2 weeks  now since this matter emerged. Prior to the Thanksgiving recess, the majority leader and others invited the automobile industry  to present plans by December 2 to the Congress on how they might restructure their industry in a way that would allow us to step forward and try to preserve them and allow them to exist for a few more weeks while a broader plan could be devised that would allow them to possibly survive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues may know, over the last several weeks we have had a number of hearings on the matter. The Presiding Officer at this point is a member of my committee, along with others who have been very diligent in sitting through long hearings, on an average of 5 or 6 hours apiece, to listen to all of the various ideas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Republican leader pointed out, it is a very complex subject matter to be asking this institution, in a matter of days, to try to understand with all of the ramifications of it. Given the precarious nature of it, I think we all appreciate at this juncture that we are looking at least one, maybe two, of the three automobile manufacturers that have existed for almost a century in our country--at a time of great economic peril, when the confidence and optimism in our country is at risk--we  run the risk over these days of watching this industry disappear. The blow to the American conscience and confidence and capability is beyond economic terms, if that occurs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I pray this evening that will not happen. No one can say with absolute certainty it will. But we have been warned. We have been cautioned by those whose jobs it is to analyze this industry who have told us that could happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tonight we will go home for the holiday recesses, but for the literally hundreds of thousands of people whose jobs depend upon this industry, this will not be a joyous season, wondering whether their jobs, their livelihoods, their homes, their children's futures are at risk because we were incapable of coming up with an answer to provide a period of time here to allow intelligent, solid, good, hard-working people to put together a plan to save the American automobile industry. It is disheartening  to me, to put it mildly, that we were unable to come to that agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say very candidly, Bob Corker is someone I have come to appreciate immensely. He is a member of my committee. We have worked very well together over this last year on many complicated issues, and I appreciate immensely his effort, as he did again this evening, to try to come to a conclusion where we could at least agree on something to move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were three major issues my friend from Tennessee brought to me. I will not go into great detail in this limited time. I will wait until tomorrow, if time permits, to go into a longer discussion. Of the three issues, we agreed on two almost immediately. On the third, involving the parity with compensation of the domestic automobile industry and those of the foreign competitors doing business here, we could not come to closure. The issue simply came down to this. There was no debate, by the  way, from the United Auto Workers or anyone else that we ought to achieve parity in those wages or benefits. The question was the timing of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are in a deep recession. People are being laid off. The Bank of America announced today 35,000 people will be laid off. Industry after industry is dropping its employees. The idea that you are going to have new hires replace the active employees in a time such as this is difficult, to put it mildly. So the notion somehow that within days or weeks after March 31 of this year that this would mandate--mandate parity between those wages of domestic companies and foreign companies was the stumbling  block.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President of the United States, the other body, Democrats and Republicans as well as the autoworkers, the heads of these companies, came together and for 8 days we negotiated an agreement. It was painful. It is not perfect by a long shot. But it allowed us to get to next year to begin to work on this in a way that might make it possible for this industry to survive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tonight, regretfully, despite the efforts of the White House, people here, people in the other body obviously, workers as well as managers, we have stumbled this evening, unable to make this closure on this issue to allow us to go forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am deeply saddened, but more than saddened I am worried this evening of what we are doing with an iconic industry. None of us here was going to write a check without conditionality. This bill I have drafted along with others is some 36 pages long and filled with conditions, establishing a czar--chosen by this President of the United States, not the coming one--to oversee this and say you must meet these obligations if you are going to survive. His determination will determine whether the industry  can go forward. If the czar were to say you have not complied, bankruptcy would entail, chapter 11 and, candidly, chapter 7. It would be nothing more than a liquidation of this industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we ought to try to avoid that. I thought most of us felt that was a bad outcome. I know my friend from Tennessee believes that, as I do. The outcome of that will cost the American taxpayers billions of dollars, by the way, and that is very well where we may end up this evening. I regret it deeply. I am saddened by it, worried about it, that in the midst of deep and troubling times we are now going to add to that substantially by walking away from an issue of whether we could agree that parity  between these wages and benefits could be achieved without slamming it down in such a way as to make it difficult for us to achieve the result.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Out of the three issues, we agreed on two and three-quarters but were unable to come to closure on this one which, frankly, in my view, was not an economic issue but a political one, because we are not demanding this of dealers, of suppliers, of anyone else. The only group we have asked this of is the workforce. No one else in this bill is required on a date certain to meet any other obligations, only this one. Yet we fully understand economically how hard that could be, to demand that kind of  accountability and not trust a czar or a leader working with the industry and others to reach that agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the majority leader I say thank you, and to your staff, the Banking Committee staff, my friend Bob Corker, the Members of the House, Republicans and Democrats, to the White House, which has been tremendously helpful in these last few days on trying to put this together without all of us agreeing. Yet, despite all of that, this evening we will not get cloture. This will fail. We will go home. I am afraid our country is going to be in deeper trouble because of this issue. I regret that  deeply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the majority leader.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412248" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to express my deep gratitude to Chris Dodd for all the work he has done over the last week, to Senator Durbin who joined us in meetings, and to all the people who have been involved in trying to reach an agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to say this is a highly technical matter. It involved volunteer employed benefit accounts, it involved bonds, it involved all kinds of discussions that were technical in nature. We had the United Auto Workers representative in the room. We had three companies in another room. We were talking to bondholders on the phone. We were certainly talking to our colleagues. We are about three words, three words away from a deal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What my colleagues wish to see is a date certain when something is going to occur. We offered any date in the year 2009, any date.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Any day. Just when will we actually get there? I think what we have offered is incredibly reasonable. I think there is a way for us to get there. I still do. There are an awful lot of bright people in this room. This is an important issue. We have solved everything substantially, and about three words keep us from reaching conclusion tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, we offered any date in 2009. We were not able to get a definitive day. And I think there is still a way to make this happen. By the way, I want to say, if this happens, this is so much better than what is before us on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These companies are going to be able to go forward with only one-third of the debt level they now have--one-third. They are going to be able to pay half of their VIVA, $21 billion to GM, half of it in stock, so it is not cash. Those companies will be stronger than they have been in 40 years if we are able to reach this agreement or they will be in Chapter 11 because there are date-certain things that have to occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very responsible piece of legislation, and I think people on both sides have acted responsibly. But we are three words--maybe two, maybe four, somewhere in that range--away from having what I believe is a landmark piece of legislation, landmark, historic, that would actually allow those companies to go ahead with strength they have not had in my lifetime. I regret that, but I thank all of those who have been involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Alabama.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300089" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have a few minutes, but first I wish to commend my colleague and fellow member of the Banking Committee, Senator Corker, for his work in this regard, trying to forge a compromise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, I think most of you know where I stand on bailouts. I do not think they work. I do not believe this one would ever work. But these companies could be saved. These companies could be saved. I have said I think they are bloated, the management is bloated. These companies either have already failed or are failing. That is a shame. These are not the General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler I knew. But all of us in America will benefit by competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come from the South, where we have a growing automobile industry, but there are 300 million people in this country, the largest automobile market in the world. There is no reason for General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler not to be competitive, but they are not going to be competitive, folks, as long as they are operating under this business model. Whether they get money soon or next year or what, it is going to be probably a lot of money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I want to tell the American people tonight, bailouts generally do not work. And this is a huge proposed bailout. I fear it is just the downpayment on more to come next year. So I would vote no on this tonight.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Michigan.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, first let me say that this is not a bailout this evening, this is a bridge loan of $14 billion to stop us potentially, if one of the companies goes under, from over $150 billion in taxpayer funds that we will be spending, including assuming the taxpayers' cost for 775,000 pensions in a bankruptcy that will go into the pension guarantee fund. So we are talking about a small bridge loan in a global credit crisis where every other country in the world has stepped up  to help their auto industry because they understand it is critical to their national defense, they understand it is critical to their economy, and they are trying to create the middle class we have had in America. In America, if this goes down tonight, we are saying we do not care about the backbone of the economy which has been and will continue to be manufacturing. Somebody has to make something in this country. We cannot all push paper on Wall Street. Somebody has to make something.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reality is, this is a tough bill. I wish to thank our leaders, Senator Reid for his patience and diligence and leadership, and Senator Dodd for his incredible patience, his staff being involved. It placed one more crisis on the doorstep of Senator Dodd to have to deal with. I appreciate Senator Corker stepping up to try to work this out and certainly Senator Voinovich and Senator Bond. Senator Levin and I have worked closely with  them. But the reality is this: If we walk away this evening and do not vote to proceed with this bill, we are saying it is okay for a major auto company in America to go bankrupt, for 2.5 million people in this economy to lose their jobs. Over what? We have a tough bill</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, what my Republican colleagues have said is that the only way we are going to do this, the only way we are going to do this, is the workers have to negotiate first with the Republican Party, with the Republicans. As long as the workers were willing to take all of the cuts the Republican Party thinks they should before the negotiation, they would be willing to step up and save the backbone of manufacturing in this country and 2.5 million jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have tried everything. We have negotiated with the White House in good faith. I appreciate that. They have kept their deal. We have negotiated with every party that wanted to come forward, including today, all day, focusing with Senator Corker. But the reality is, we are in a position where evidently the only thing that matters to the majority of those on the other side of the aisle is that workers get paid too much in this country--somehow, workers get paid too much in this country--and  unless we sock it to the workers, they are not willing to allow a $14 billion bridge loan to be able to save an industry and save an--</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, can we have order? I would like us to at least give the courtesy of listening to the Senator since we are not going to give her the courtesy of the vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there are those who think they can play games with this and there are no consequences. This is not, tonight, about Democrats and Republicans. It is not about auto executives versus workers. This is about the economy of this country. We are in serious trouble, ladies and gentlemen. If one of our auto companies goes down, we are going to pick up the paper and begin to see the suppliers of this country go down. And they supply not only the folks in my State, they supply  Toyota, Nissan, and Honda. They supply the Army. The same folks who make the axles for the trucks that our brave men and women are driving in Iraq and Afghanistan today make the axles put on our trucks and our cars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reality is, our national defense and our economy and the middle class of this country are hanging in the balance by this vote. Shame on us if we walk away cavalierly thinking that we can do this another time. Now is the time. People are watching, not just in Michigan but all across the country, businesses large and small, families in their homes, retirees who have done nothing but work hard their whole lives and now want to know their pensions or their health care, as part of something they  worked for all of their lives, is protected. This is about whether we are going to make a commitment to the middle class and a commitment to American manufacturing. You cannot walk away from the American auto industry and not affect every part of manufacturing in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not too late. I know we assume the votes are not there, but the votes can be there. There are enough votes in this room. There are enough votes in this room to give them the chance, just the chance to restructure. And if folks do not believe in the end that what they have come up with, 3 months from now, is good enough, then that is it. But don't 2.5 million people and the major auto presence and manufacturing in this country deserve 3 months, 3 months of time to be able to restructure,  for advanced manufacturing in the future? If we do not do that, we are going to change our dependence on foreign oil for a dependence on foreign automobiles. We will be asking other countries to send us their tanks, send us their automobiles, send us their trucks for our defense. That  makes no sense. People of good will know better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask my colleagues to join with us in voting for the future and the economy of this country.</paragraph>
