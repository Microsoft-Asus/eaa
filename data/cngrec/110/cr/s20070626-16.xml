    <paragraph>Madam President, at 2:15, the amendment was 10 minutes away. We called a few minutes ago and it is now 5 minutes away. I don't know how time is kept in the legislative office, but I understand that people have made minor changes and that has caused the need to reprint part of the amendment. I wish to waste as little time as possible. I think it will be a few more minutes, so maybe we can adjourn subject to the call of the Chair, and as soon as it gets here, I will let everyone know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess subject to the call of the chair.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:54 p.m., recessed subject to the call of the Chair until 5:38 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mr. SALAZAR).</narrative>
