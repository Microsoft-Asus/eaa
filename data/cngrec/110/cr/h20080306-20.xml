    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I wonder in view of the truncated schedule that we have had this afternoon, if anyone on the majority side knows if we might be bringing up the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the FISA Act, the bipartisan Senate bill that was passed  that we certainly have time to deal with this afternoon. I wonder if anyone might be able to let us know if we are bringing that up this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, continuing to reserve, I know it certainly is an important issue. We have had communications from 25 State attorneys general.</paragraph>
