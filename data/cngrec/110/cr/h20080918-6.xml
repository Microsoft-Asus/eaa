    <paragraph>Our prayer is offered this morning by Pastor Chuck Coffelt, my pastor from my home church, the United Methodist Church of Gillett, Arkansas. He pastors a community where they still know when you are born and they care when you die, where happiness and sorrow are shared by the community and where a helping hand is offered when needed. We are delighted to be joined this morning online by the Gillett School and their mascot, the Wolves, to show support for our special community.</paragraph>
