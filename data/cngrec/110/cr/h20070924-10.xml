  <narrative>HATEMONGER SPEAKS AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10700]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the University of Hate has a new branch campus and it is called Columbia University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madman, maniac, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is speaking today at Columbia. The Iranian President believes in the murder of the Jewish people in Israel. He is a hater of Americans. He is sending money, arms, and ammunition to Iraq that is used to kill American troops. Not the kind of person that deserves a U.S. audience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Columbia doesn't care. The University said that they would have even invited warmonger Hitler to speak on their campus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the university does have some people that they refuse to allow on campus. This is the same university that, in 1969 during the Vietnam War and peacenik movement, banned the ROTC from campus. And in spite of current law and a Supreme Court ruling, still bans the ROTC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Columbia University clearly shows a pattern of being anti-American by promoting forums to warmongers and by preventing the U.S. military ROTC program on campus. Maybe the university should just relocate to Tehran. And in the meantime, the U.S. taxpayers have no business sending American money to the University of Hate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
