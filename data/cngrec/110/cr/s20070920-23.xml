    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a colloquy with my friend the distinguished Senator from Colorado, Mr. KEN SALAZAR, who I have the pleasure of serving with as cochair of the Senate Democratic Hispanic Task Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, I would like to spend a moment talking about the landmark 1947 discrimination case Mendez v. Westminster, which established the legal precedent on which Brown v. Board of Education was based. It is an extremely important piece of our civil rights history, but sadly, it is often overlooked. Senator Salazar and I would like to remedy that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me illustrate the importance of this case. I want you to picture two students, both equally bright, eager to learn, and full of possibility. One student sits in a beautiful new school building surrounded by the best books, a good heating system, and a clean cafeteria. The other sits in a dilapidated old shed with torn and tattered books that are far too old. The heat doesn't work because there's no furnace, and the cafeteria doesn't exist. As you all know, this was what occurred in towns  throughout our country for far too long before Brown v. Board of Education ruled that separate was inherently unequal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sylvia Mendez, a victim of separate but equal before Brown v. Board of Education, was only 8 years old when she and her brothers were prohibited from attending a Whites-only school in Westminster, CA, in Orange County. Her father, along with five other Mexican-American fathers whose children were forced to attend subpar, segregated schools, challenged school segregation in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, claiming their children were victims of unconstitutional discrimination. This historic  court battle ultimately ended school segregation in California and set in motion the legal process that would eventually end school segregation in America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Like my colleague Senator BOB MENENDEZ, I believe it is critical to recognize the contributions that Sylvia Mendez and her family have made to the advancement of civil rights. The Mendez family's struggle for equality is a reminder to me that we must continue to fight for equal and quality education for all our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, many young Hispanic students today attend schools that are lacking in resources, equipment, and highly qualified teachers. Nationally, Latinos are four times more likely to drop out of high school than their White counterparts and only 1 in 10 Latinos has obtained a 4-year college degree. Reforms to our education system are clearly needed to address these disparities and continue the legacy of Sylvia Menendez.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Education is a critical pathway to realizing the American dream. It is what allows every child to transcend the barriers of race, class, background, or disability to achieve their potential to be what they choose in life. A wise historian once said that, "Education is the means by which we exult our successes and remedy our failures and the process by which we transmit our civilization from one generation to the next."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We take this moment to recommit ourselves to uphold the legacy of Sylvia Mendez and her brothers. This is what Hispanic Heritage Month is all about.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank Senator KEN SALAZAR for the work he does on the Senate Democratic Hispanic Task Force on behalf of Latinos. My colleague understands, like I do, that we must not only celebrate the accomplishments of Latinos but turn to the future in to ensure that Latinos are protected by our laws and able to achieve the American dream. Sylvia Mendez, who has become a premier civil rights advocate and leader as a result of this case, is a clear example of what it means to achieve  that dream.</paragraph>
