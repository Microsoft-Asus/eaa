    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to salute the House of Representatives for passing <bill type="h" number="980">H.R. 980</bill>, the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, more than ever, public safety employees are being stretched to capacity. With the deployment of our National Guard to Iraq, our local communities are being asked to respond to emergencies with often depleted resources and manpower.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our local first responders represent the highest in public service. By providing them with collective bargaining rights, we can help these patriotic men and women secure adequate equipment, ensure workplace safety, and promote pay and benefits that will allow us to recruit the best and brightest to these important professions. This legislation represents an effort to put words into action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, our Nation's firefighters, police officers, and EMS personnel do right by the American people every day, keeping our families and communities safe. It is high time that we honor their service by enacting this legislation and providing them with the Federal resources they need to do their job.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
