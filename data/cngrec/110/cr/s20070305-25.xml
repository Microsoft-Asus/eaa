    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the lifetime contributions of Dr. Lawrence Thomas Geraty as he retires as president of La Sierra University in southern California. Dr. Geraty's strengths as a churchman, educator, academic, and administrator provide an example for us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Geraty has been a college and university president for the past 22 years, first taking on this role at Union College in South Lancaster, MA, in 1985. For the past 14 years he has served as president of La Sierra University in Riverside, CA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Growing up as a member of a Seventh-Day Adventist missionary family, Lawrence Geraty gained a broad perspective of the world, living abroad or attending educational institutions in China including Hong Kong, Burma, Lebanon, England, Germany, France, and Israel. He earned his bachelor's degree from Pacific Union College, then graduated from the Theological Seminary at Andrews University. Following his graduation, he served as a pastor in Santa Ana, CA, for a brief period of time. Thereafter, he  joined Andrews Theological Seminary as a faculty member. After serving at Andrews, he went to Harvard University to study Hebrew Bible and Biblical archaeology, earning his Ph.D. with distinction and completing examinations in 10 languages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After receiving his Ph.D. Dr. Geraty returned to Andrews Theological Seminary to work as Professor of Archaeology and History of Antiquity. For the next 13 years, Dr. Geraty served as an educator and scholar in Jamaica, Jordan, Costa Rica, Trinidad, Europe, and Australia. During this period, he was a founding director of the Institute of Archaeology at Andrews University, led a series of major archaeological expeditions in the Middle East, and worked as the curator of the Horn Archaeological  Museum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Geraty has had led a prominent career in academia. He was the recipient of a Fulbright fellowship. He served as an adviser on archaeology to former Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan. He served as vice president of the American Center of Oriental Research in Amman, Jordan from 1982 to 2002. He represented the U.S. Office of Education in a delegation of administrators to study minority education in China. He has published roughly 50 scholarly journal articles, edited 8 books and provided contributions  to over 30 books.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his tenure as president of La Sierra University, the university has seen tremendous growth and has played an integral role in the growth of inland southern California and our Nation. Between 1993 and 2006 university enrollment nearly doubled. In 2002, a biotechnology laboratory opened. In 2004, U.S. News and World Report distinguished La Sierra University for its successes in student diversity. And this year, Dr. Geraty had the great distinction of being named "Citizen of the Year" by  the Greater Riverside Chamber of Commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his time as president of La Sierra University, Dr. Lawrence Geraty has provided our Nation with a role model of leadership and citizenship. His commitment continues to leave a legacy of service to academia, scholarship, education, his community and our Nation, and I applaud his lifetime of service as he retires.</paragraph>
