  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - September 10, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11283">S11283</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning the Senate will immediately proceed to executive session for an hour's debate regarding three noncontroversial--we hope, at least--District Court nominations. The time is equally divided and controlled between Senators LEAHY and SPECTER or their designees, and Members can expect votes on these nominations to occur at approximately 11 a.m. this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once the nominations have been confirmed, Senator Barrasso will be recognized to give his maiden speech, and he will be recognized for up to 30 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to Senator Barrasso and others, sometimes these maiden speeches bear fruit. I remember my first speech. I was speaking on the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights, and presiding, as is the Senator from Virginia today, was Senator David Pryor from Arkansas, who was chairman of the IRS Subcommittee of the Finance Committee. Also listening to this speech, fortuitously, was Senator Grassley, who was a member of the Finance Committee--not a senior member but someone who was active. When  I finished my speech, talking about the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights making it a more level playing field between the taxpayer and the tax collector, Senator Pryor had written a note, given it to a page, and he said to me he liked what I was trying to do and would help me. I also got a communication from Senator Grassley that he wanted to work on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, to make a long story short, Mr. President, because of their involvement, I had to do very little. That legislation passed, and it was landmark legislation. It was not because of my ability to communicate as much as who was listening. So I say to Senator Barrasso: You never know what is going to happen with your maiden speech.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once he has completed his speech, the Senate will proceed to the Transportation Appropriations bill. Senators MURRAY and BOND are managers, and they are prepared to finish that legislation this week. There should be votes prior to 5:30 or 6 o'clock tonight. After that, we will have no votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tomorrow should be a very long, productive day because at 1 o'clock on Wednesday we can have no more votes. We can do more Senate business, but because of the Jewish holiday there will be no more votes after that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on September 17, which is a week from today, there will be no votes but there will be work. I indicated to the distinguished Republican leader and others that we are going to do what we can to see if we can get the DC-Utah congressional thing worked out, the Voter Rights Bill. What we are working on now is to get some type of consent to have a cloture vote on that sometime next week. That hasn't been resolved yet but we are working on it. I have kept Senator Lieberman  involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week, also, we are going to move to the authorization bill for Defense, which has to be completed. We  need to complete this appropriations bill this week, because as soon as we complete the Defense authorization bill, we need to move to Defense Appropriations. That is what we have to complete before the end of the work period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are other things we have to do. We have to have some extension or some agreement on what we are going to do with the farm bill. We have SCHIP that we need to work on prior to the end of this month. So we have a tremendous amount of work to do. Last week was a very productive week. We had to work a couple of late nights, but it was worth it. So that should set us up for this week and give us an idea of what we are going to do next week.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would ask one question of my good friend, the majority leader. I didn't hear him indicate whether--and maybe he doesn't know yet--the Iraq debate will occur in the context of the DOD authorization bill or separate from that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am going to try to work with the minority leader to see what we can work out as to whether we want to have the Iraq votes intertwined with Defense authorization or whether we do not. I have Members telling me on the Defense authorization bill that they are going to offer an amendment to close Guantanamo and offer habeas corpus, so it is going to be a contested piece of legislation. We have to complete that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some who believe we would be better off having the Iraq matters separate and apart from Defense authorization. I have to work that out first with Senators Levin and McCain. My initial report from them is that they would rather have them separate, but I will work with the minority leader and we will try to finish deciding what we are going to do by Wednesday or Thursday of this week.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am going to make some remarks in my leader time. I would ask the Chair if this is the appropriate time to do that.</paragraph>
