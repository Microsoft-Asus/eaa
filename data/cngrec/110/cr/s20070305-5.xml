    <paragraph>Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 3 p.m. During this time, Senators are permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. It is my understanding there are a number of Members on both sides who will be here to take up that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At 3 p.m., the Senate will resume consideration of the 9/11 legislation, <bill type="s" number="4">S. 4</bill>. We have been told a number of Members want to offer amendments. I hope that is the case. So I look forward to them coming to the Senate Chamber today to offer those amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, the Republican leader's staff and my staff, along with the relevant committee staff, were negotiating a time when the Senate would vote on the collective bargaining amendment. I understand that has been offered by Senator DeMint. The proposal is for the amendment to be voted on at 2:30 on Tuesday. We hope that can be accomplished sometime early this afternoon as to whether we will be able to lock in this agreement. I will be in a position at that time to announce our vote  schedule, which is at 5:30 today. However, Members are alerted that a vote or votes could occur at 5:30 today. I will provide more information as the day proceeds.</paragraph>
