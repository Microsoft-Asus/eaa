    <paragraph>Mr. President, California and the entire Nation lost a remarkable leader yesterday with the passing of my friend, Congressman Tom Lantos. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>From his leadership as chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs to his founding of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, Congressman Lantos went about his work with a dignity and a seriousness that transcended politics. In a time of bitter divisions, he earned the respect of colleagues from both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a survivor of the Holocaust, Congressman Lantos brought to Congress a profound personal commitment to human rights. We will remember not only his courage and his optimism, but also his deep affection for his adopted country. He leaves behind a legacy of hope and inspiration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal level, it was an honor to call Tom a colleague and a friend. I was proud to work with him on so many important issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember working with him to secure funding to build a tunnel to bypass a section of Route 1 that was so frequently closed by landslides that it was known as "Devil's Slide." It took years, but they broke ground on the tunnel in November. And it is a fitting tribute to the passion with which he served his constituents that there is a bill before the State senate to name that tunnel in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Lantos was a true statesman, and we will miss him. My heart goes out to his family during this time of grief. They are in our thoughts and in our prayers.</paragraph>
