    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of my constituent, Army Specialist Carla Jane Stewart of the 250th Transportation Company based in El Monte, California. Specialist Stewart was killed in action on January 28, 2007 in Tallil, Iraq, when her military convoy vehicle overturned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Carla was born in La Canada Flintridge, California to an Armenian American family. Her father, Edmond Aprahamian, a former Marine, and her mother, Emmy Aprahamian, are proud parents who will cherish the memory of their daughter who chose to enlist in the U.S. Army at the age of 35. After completing her basic training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, she told her family and friends that if her unit was not deployed to Iraq, that she would volunteer to go. As it turned out, the 250th was deployed  to Iraq last year and is due to return home in March.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Carla learned mechanical drafting alongside her father. Her family and friends have spoken with reverence of her distinctive commitment to duty, her dedication to her unit, her love of country and family. According to her father, Carla always had a smile. She was a small woman; her unit called her Stewart Little, but she was gutsy and in every other way giant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It takes a special commitment to volunteer for military service in a time of war, and even greater devotion to country to do so at the age of 35, a time when most of us have put aside thoughts of abandoning the comfort of home to take up arms in the fight for liberty and freedom. Specialist Carla Jane Stewart did both, and on behalf of the United States House of Representatives, we honor her memory.</paragraph>
