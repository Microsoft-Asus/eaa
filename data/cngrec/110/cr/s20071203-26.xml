    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the 100th anniversary of the Roseville Fire Department in Roseville, CA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In November 1907, a group of downtown merchants in the railroad community of Roseville came together and formed the Citizens Volunteer Fire Department after devastating fires destroyed and threatened many of their businesses. The department opened under the leadership of fire chief W.B. Musson, who was joined by assistant fire chief W.T. Butler and 16 volunteer firefighters to protect the town of approximately 6,000 residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the city of Roseville was incorporated in 1909, the department was officially named the "Roseville Fire Department" and for over 50 years worked out of two fire stations and added a third in 1961. In 1947, after 40 years as a volunteer fire department, the Roseville Fire Department hired a full-time firefighting team to protect the rapidly growing city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the Roseville Fire Department has 130 employees serving over 100,000 residents with 8 fire stations, a 3-acre training facility, a technical rescue team, a hazardous materials team and emergency medical technicians at every fire station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the firefighters and community celebrate the Roseville Fire Department's centennial anniversary, I would like to congratulate and thank all of the brave men and women of the Roseville Fire Department who have proudly served their community over the past 100 years.</paragraph>
