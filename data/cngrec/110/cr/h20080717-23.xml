    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I speak on behalf of the 12 to 14 million immigrants here in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the memory of Lance Corporal Jose Gutierrez will always remain in our hearts. Gutierrez, an undocumented immigrant who came here as an orphan from Guatemala, graduated from high school despite many obstacles. While in community college, he enlisted as a marine to show his patriotism and love for this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 31, 2003, Gutierrez became the first combat casualty of the war of Iraq. His belief in the American dream of a better life is a testament of what many others who come to this country wish to have. Gutierrez will forever be a symbol of patriotism, hard work, and commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, his sacrifices are lost in the hateful anti-immigrant rhetoric. Every day, 12 to 14 million immigrants work from sunset to sundown to reach the American dream--all positively contributing to America's economic health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to keep in mind these contributions and make a firm commitment to work towards comprehensive immigration reform.</paragraph>
