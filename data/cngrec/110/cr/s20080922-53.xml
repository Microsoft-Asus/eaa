  <narrative> Resolved, That the Senate designates September 25, 2008, as "National First Responder Appreciation Day" to honor and celebrate the contributions and sacrifices made by all first responders in the United States. &lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution today that will designate September 25 as National First Responder Appreciation Day. Last year I introduced this resolution with my good friend and colleague Senator Robert Casey and I am pleased Senator Casey has joined me again in honoring our first responders. I am also pleased to be joined by Senators Akaka, Bennett, Brown, Chambliss, Clinton, Coleman, Crapo, Domenici, Durbin, Enzi, Hutchison, Inhofe, Kennedy,  Landrieu, Leahy, Lieberman, Mikulski, Murray, Pryor, Rockefeller, Sanders, Stabenow, Stevens, Voinovich, Whitehouse and Wicker in this important recognition of our men and women who keep us safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The contributions that our Nation's 1.1 million firefighters, 900,000 police officers, and 890,000 emergency medical professionals make in our communities are familiar to us all. Their heroics can be seen every night on our TV screens, read about in our papers, and heralded by the survivors of every modern disaster. From the wildfires in Colorado and California, the tragic events at Virginia Tech, and the horrific damage of Hurricanes Katrina, Gustav, and Ike, our first responders regularly risk  their lives to protect property, uphold the law, and save the lives of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The duty of a first responder is never without risk and requires the courage to place the safety of others ahead of one's own. It is courage that compels a firefighter to rush into a burning building, a police officer to charge into an active shooter, and an emergency medical professional to perform precision lifesaving procedures in the most hazardous conditions imaginable. While all of these brave Americans know the risks involved, some make that ultimate sacrifice to save another, at the cost  of their own life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every year over 100 firefighters and nearly 200 police officers are killed in the line of duty. And while some may not consider a career in the emergency medical services dangerous, EMS workers actually have an occupational fatality rate comparable to that of firefighters and police officers. I know I speak on behalf of all Americans when I express my sincerest appreciation for their service and sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we recognize our first responders for their sacrifices, we also acknowledge their everyday contributions that make our communities throughout America a safer place. In addition to battling fires, firefighters reach out through fire prevention and public education, like teaching our children about fire safety and proper emergency response. In addition to arresting criminals, police officers encourage communities to stay involved in crime prevention and cooperate with law enforcement to help  make our neighborhoods safer and more livable. If we or our loved ones experience a medical emergency, EMTs are there at a moment's notice to provide lifesaving care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In many ways, our first responders embody the very best of the American spirit. With charity and compassion, these brave men and women commit themselves to preserving the highest standard of life we all enjoy in this great Nation. Through their actions they have become heroes to many, through their examples they have become role models to us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While various cities and towns have recognized the contributions made by their local first responders, there exists no national day to honor and thank these courageous men and women. The time has come to give our first responders the national day of appreciation that they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Designating September 25 as National First Responder Appreciation Day provides an opportunity for this institution and the people of the United States to honor first responders for their contributions, sacrifices, and dedication to public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting passage of this worthwhile resolution.</paragraph>
