  <speaking speaker="300084" topic="SENATE RESOLUTION 191--ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL GOAL FOR THE UNIVERSAL DEPLOYMENT OF NEXT-GENERATION BROADBAND NETWORKS TO ACCESS THE INTERNET AND FOR OTHER USES BY 2015, AND CALLING UPON CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY, ENACT LEGISLATION, AND ADOPT POLICIES TO ACCOMPLISH THIS OBJECTIVE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important policy matter facing our Nation. Many of us in this body have for years called for a national broadband policy. Today, I am formally proposing the establishment of that national policy. I will propose that we take two steps: establish a goal, and develop a strategy to meet the goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although broadband services are expanding and more consumers are subscribing to broadband, our Nation is falling behind the rest of the world in the deployment next generation broadband infrastructure. Broadband as we know it will be obsolete and we must begin to examine how the United States can remain a leader in communications technology. As a nation, we must have a thoughtful national policy to make sure all Americans have the communications infrastructure that they need to learn and compete  in a global environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A national broadband policy is critical to the future of our country. Having a very robust broadband network available to all Americans would provide a tremendous social and economic benefit. The latest phrase in the broadband lexicon is "exaflood." It refers to the flood of new, high bandwidth applications that are now available to those with a fast connection. The number of broadband applications now available is almost unimaginable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last year, social networking Web sites, such as YouTube and MySpace, have become integral parts of our society. But, expanded connectivity would allow doctors to diagnose remotely medical conditions, music students to study with an instructor hundreds of miles away, and scientists to monitor ocean floor vents from their offices on shore. This is the real potential of broadband to transform our lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who have a fast enough pipe to use those applications will enjoy a huge benefit, both social and economic. As we all recognize, creating next generation broadband networks is crucial to our international competitiveness. It is not news that the United States is lagging many other nations in terms of penetration of current-generation broadband, for example, cable modems and digital subscriber lines. Perhaps more worrisome is that we are also falling behind in terms of next-generation broadband  technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Japan, tens of millions of people have access to a direct fiber connection, and 100 megabit connections are commonplace. Korea has been the leader in DSL for years, and now it also is extending fiber all the way to the home. The same is happening in Europe--100 megabit connections are becoming routine in these countries, and it is crucial that the United States not fall behind again. We must have a policy that ensures the deployment of a strong broadband network for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first step in going somewhere is to know where you are going, and the same is true in public policy. We need a goal. And the goal should be an ambitious, yet achievable one. The second step is to decide how to achieve that goal. We need a roadmap. And, we need it now. By the end of 2007, we should establish a national goal and pass a series of policy actions designed to achieve our national goal. There will likely be multiple parts to the plan, and we will likely need to modify those parts  over time. But if we do not have a plan, we cannot expect to accomplish our goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today I am introducing a resolution calling for two things: A national goal of 10 megabits per second universally available in the United States by the end of 2010, and 100 megabits by the end of 2015. As I said, that is ambitious, but achievable. A number of different wireline and wireless technologies are today capable of delivering five megabits or more, and their efficacy is constantly increasing. Ten megabits by 2010 is achievable. And by 2015 we can do much better and achieve true next  generation speeds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we do our work, by 2015 we can become a true "100 Megabit Nation." Today, speeds of 30 megabits or higher are available to millions of Americans due to the healthy competition developing between telephone companies and cable television companies, complemented by many forward-thinking real estate developers and municipalities. These entities are beginning to offer "triple play" services, voice, video and data, requiring them to deploy new technologies delivering very fast speeds. Having  general availability of 100 megabits is achievable by 2015 if we push the technology envelope. We can do it, and we should resolve today to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second part of my resolution says that by the end of this year, 2007, we will develop a strategy for achieving our national goal. I will suggest policy actions for inclusion in that strategy, and many of you will as well. I think we should have tax incentives to push the private sector beyond their current deployment plans, we should offer low-interest loans for the same purpose, we should reform the Universal Service Fund to encourage broadband deployment, we should free municipalities to  deploy as they see fit, we should ensure the wise use of wireless spectrum, and the list goes on. There will be new proposals to deal with new challenges and new opportunities. We should develop the first U.S. national broadband policy by the end of 2007, and we should revisit it every year thereafter to modify it as necessary. That is what my resolution calls for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I invite my colleagues to join me in this call for a national broadband goal and strategy. We have talked about it for years. Now it is time to take action. We owe this to our constituents and the country. We must act to provide them with the benefits that a powerful broadband network can bring, and we must begin today.</paragraph>
