  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this week, the Democrats will bring to the floor their budget, fiscal year 2008, that they passed out of committee. This budget promises to do two things: Raise taxes and increase spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My Republican colleagues and I will put forth a substitute that uses common sense to balance the budget in 5 years. It lowers spending, reforms unsustainable entitlement programs, and encourages economic growth without raising taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a result of the Republican supported tax policies passed in 2001 through 2005, every taxpayer who paid income taxes this year will get tax relief. My Republican colleagues and I believe government should limit taxing and spending and ease the burden on the economy. Let the country grow. The difference between the two budgets are plain and simple: The Democrats trust government, the Republicans trust people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the fiscally responsible Republican substitute when it is brought to the floor later this week.</paragraph>
