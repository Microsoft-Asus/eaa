    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in roll call 348, which I just missed a minute ago, the COPS Improvements Act of 2007, I am a strong supporter of that bill. That bill provides, we believe, 165 police positions in my home State of Maine. I certainly intended to vote for that bill and would have had I been in the Chamber at that moment.</paragraph>
