    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I would like to note that I am here for the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) and if she does come in, I will relinquish my duties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in the meantime, Mr. Speaker, this bill, <bill type="h" number="3068">H.R. 3068</bill>, as amended, is the result of two oversight hearings held by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee that examined the role of Federal Protective Service, FPS, in providing security for our Nation's public buildings. There was evidence of serious allegations of wrongdoing, chaos, and irregularities in contracting employment of private security guards who protect Federal employees and facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation intends to preserve the security of the country's most sensitive buildings. Due to the security needs of a Federal building, it is surprising that an individual with a felony conviction would hold a contract for security services in a Federal building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill codifies the commonsense approach to providing security for Federal buildings. Specifically, this bill directs the Secretary of Homeland Security not to award any security guard contracts through the Federal Protective Service to any company that is owned, controlled, or operated by a convicted felon. The bill would ensure that contractors are capable, responsible and ethical as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Contract security officers are a critical component of Federal strategies to protect the safety and security of Federal employees, visitors to Federal buildings and the surrounding community. Given the critical role these guards play in Federal security, this bill will hold owners of companies who provide security to Federal buildings to the highest standards. I urge all Members to vote for <bill type="h" number="3068">H.R. 3068</bill>, as amended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I don't have any other speakers and I am going to talk about the bill, but I know it is Ms. Norton's bill and she may want to say something before I do. I would reserve the balance of my time and would like to speak after her if that is all right.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri, and particularly thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania in my absence for assuming the responsibility because I was at a hearing on Blackwater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3068">H.R. 3068</bill>, as amended, the Federal Protective Service Guard Contracting Reform Act of 2007, ensures that Federal Protective Service guard contractors are "capable, responsible, and ethical," and those are the words of the regulation. I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for facilitating early consideration of this bill, and for the leadership on both sides, including the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management Ranking Member Graves for  understanding its importance and for their efforts in support of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Protective Service Guard Contracting Reform Act prohibits the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security from contracting with any security guard service that is owned, controlled or operated by an individual who has been convicted of a felony. The bill would eliminate proxy operation by felons who are relatives, spouses or others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3068">H.R. 3068</bill>, as amended, is a result of two oversight hearings Mr. Graves and I held that examined the role of the Federal Protective Service in providing security for the Nation's public buildings. There was evidence of serious allegations of wrongdoing, chaos and irregularities in the contracting and employment of private security guards whose mission it is to protect Federal employees and facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our subcommittee worked closely with appropriate Department of Homeland Security officials to eliminate the backlog in payments to guards and to correct FPS mismanagement that risked the security of Federal employees and visitors. FPS guards, like guards employed by the Federal Government, these security guards are used on our most sensitive buildings, including here in the Nation's Capital and the National Capital region where your most secure facilities are located.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, it was surprising to learn that an individual with a felony conviction would hold a contract for security services in a Federal building, especially here, but frankly anywhere in the United States in the post-9/11 climate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was clear that this bill was necessary when our subcommittee learned at a hearing in June that an FPS security guard contractor had failed to pay 600 D.C. area Federal security officers and to make other important benefit payments to pensions, health benefits and the like. Our subcommittee intervened when an action by the FPS and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a division of DHS where FPS is placed, was reported to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The effects on the security of employees, visitors and the Federal agencies alike could not be ignored in today's post-9/11 climate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are indebted to the contract security officers who continue to work to protect Federal workers, the visiting public and the work sites, as well as to their unions. As a result of the subcommittee's June hearing, we learned that an individual who had served 5 years in prison for money laundering and fraud was a de facto owner of a private security business despite Federal law barring felons from owning companies that do business with the Federal Government. In fact, it was the felon, not his  wife, who came forward to defend the company after it failed to pay the 600 D.C.-based guards despite receipt of funds for payment from the FPS. His testimony concerning his operational control of the company was nothing short of a case study in evasion of existing law by taking advantage of obvious loopholes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>His company has, of course, since been dismissed. <bill type="h" number="3068">H.R. 3068</bill>, as amended, strengthens existing requirements and prohibits all proxy ownerships by felons, including control or operation by an individual who has been convicted of a felony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3068">H.R. 3068</bill>, as amended, reminds us that we must not lose sight of the mission of private contract guards who serve the Federal Government to guard Federal employees and sites as vital as nuclear plants and military posts against terrorism and crime. The example of unpaid contract guards and apparent misuse of Federal funds that had been directed to pay them demonstrated why these contractors must be required to have a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics. <bill type="h" number="3068">H.R. 3068</bill>, as amended,  codifies this important requirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400158" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3068">H.R. 3068</bill>, introduced by Subcommittee Chairwoman Norton, adds an additional level of security to our Federal buildings by prohibiting the Federal Protective Services from awarding contracts to convicted felons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to commend Chairwoman Norton for her commitment to the security of Federal buildings, government employees and visitors. She probably has more than anybody else in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The protection of the employees and visitors at Federal buildings remains a high priority. This legislation will increase the standards of safety and security for Federal properties across this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Protective Service serves as one of the first lines of defense for our Federal buildings. We entrust the security of Federal courthouses and buildings and their employees and visitors to FPS personnel. From day-to-day security screening, to protection from riots and terrorist attacks, the FPS force plays a vital role in facilitating the work of the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Protective Service employs more than 1,000 trained employees and more than 15,000 contract security guards. <bill type="h" number="3068">H.R. 3068</bill> prohibits FPS from contracting with security firms that are owned or operated by convicted felons. It's a very simple measure. The security of Federal buildings must be managed by those that have the best interests of the American people in mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will ensure the integrity of the forces protecting our Federal buildings, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="3068">H.R. 3068</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think this is a fantastic idea, and again, I want to applaud Chairwoman Norton for the work that she's done on this, again, to push it through.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his kind words to me and for his work with me on the committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3068">H.R. 3068</bill>. This bill represents an important step in ensuring the safety of Federal employees and all those who work in and visit our Federal buildings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Delegate of the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), chair of the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management, for bringing this issue to the attention of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and for quickly developing and advancing, in a bipartisan manner, a remedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 18, 2007, the committee held a hearing entitled "Proposals to Downsize the Federal Protective Service and Effects on the Protection of Federal Buildings". The hearing probed the Department of Homeland Security's plans to cut the presence of Federal Protective Service, FPS, officers nationally. The reliance on contract security guards to protect Federal buildings is a troubling trend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3068">H.R. 3068</bill> prohibits the award of contracts to provide guard services under the contract security guard program of the FPS to any business that is owned, controlled, or operated by an individual who has been convicted of a felony. The bill directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to promulgate regulations within 6 months to implement the provisions of this act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill offers a common sense way to ensure that security contracts that provide an essential service are awarded only to contractors who are "capable, responsible, and ethical" as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support this bill and urge its passage.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brady) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="3068">H.R. 3068</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
