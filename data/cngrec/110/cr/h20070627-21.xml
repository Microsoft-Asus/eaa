  <speaking speaker="412213" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, like the majority of my constituents, I believe that any and all attempts to enact immigration reform must not include amnesty for lawbreakers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My constituents are tired of empty promises from Washington, DC, and we must address our Nation's immigration problems in a way that produces real results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Americans are divided on what immigration reform should entail, but on one point almost all Americans agree. We must secure our borders. With a secured border, we can build on solutions to strengthen our country and maintain our heritage of embracing legal immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to create a work permit program that meets the evolving needs of today's agriculture industry. Serious reform is also needed to bring an end to the massive amount of bureaucratic red tape in our immigration system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The crafters of the immigration bill currently being debated in the Senate are misguided on how to fix America's immigration problem. And on behalf of the American people, I urge my colleagues to secure our borders and enact commonsense immigration reforms.</paragraph>
