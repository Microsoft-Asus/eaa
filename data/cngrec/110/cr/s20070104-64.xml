  <speaking speaker="300025" topic="TITLE II--LOBBYING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2007">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in cosponsoring <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>, a bill to provide greater transparency in the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The recent elections sent a clear message to Congress that the American people have lost confidence in their government. Without the support of the people, we cannot tackle the difficult issues that this Congress must face. This bill, then, is a critical part of restoring the people's trust by reforming ethics and lobbying rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to remember that the conduct of most Members and their staffs is beyond reproach. Likewise, it is important to recognize that lobbying--whether done on behalf of the business community, an environmental organization, a children's advocacy group, or any other cause--can provide us with useful information and analysis that aids, but does not dictate, the decision-making process. Unfortunately, in the minds of many Americans, "lobbying" has come to be associated with expensive  paid vacations masquerading as fact-finding trips, special access to Members and staff that an ordinary citizen could never hope to have, and undue influence that leads to decisions made in the best interest of the lobbyist and his or her client instead of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> which is nearly identical to a bill that was the product of bipartisan efforts by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration and that was passed by this Senate just last year--includes a number of important provisions that will help to restore the public image of the United States Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> bans gifts from lobbyists. This is clear, brightline rule that diminishes the appearance of impropriety that gifts can create.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> requires greater disclosure of the sponsors of and the purposes for earmarks included in a bill so that the people can know where tax dollars are being spent and why.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> eliminates floor privileges for former Members who are seeking to lobby other members. They will enjoy no more access to Senators and Congressmen than any other citizen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> will eliminate the practice of anonymous holds in the Senate so that we can bring debate into the open and not simply kill a bill with a secret hold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> will require enhanced disclosure of the activities of groups lobbying Congress so that the public can easily find out which interests are trying to influence the decisions we make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> will slow the revolving door between the Hill and the private sector by limiting the ability of departing Members and staff to lobby their former colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill, I also believe strongly that it would be improved by the addition of an independent Office of Public Integrity within the Legislative Branch. This Office would be able to conduct nonpartisan investigations of possible ethics violations. These investigations would help to promote public confidence in the enforcement of any laws that we pass to enhance congressional ethics. During debate on this bill last year, an amendment that Senator LIEBERMAN,  Senator MCCAIN, and I offered to create this Office was defeated. However, I hope my colleagues have taken the lessons of the recent elections to heart and that the idea of an Office of Public Integrity will be approved this year. To that end, I am also cosponsoring Senator MCCAIN's lobbying reform package, which he has introduced today and which contains a number of the provisions of <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> as well as creating an independent Office of Public Integrity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I once again commend my colleagues on recognizing the importance of this issue by making it our first priority in the 110th Congress. I urge the Senate to work quickly to get this legislation finished so that we can move on from the task of governing ourselves and get down to the business of governing our Nation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="Introducing S. 22. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to establish a program of educational assistance for members of the Armed Forces who serve in the Armed Forces after September 11, 2001, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="22">S. 22</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of a bill that I am introducing, entitled the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007. This bill is designed to expand the educational benefits that our Nation offers to the brave men and women who have served us so honorably since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a veteran who hails from a family with a long history of military service, I am proud to offer this bill as my first piece of legislation in the United States Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of us know that our country has a tradition--since World War II--of offering educational assistance to returning veterans. In the 1940s, the first G.I. bill helped transform notions of equality in American society. The G.I. bill program was designed to help veterans readjust to civilian life, avoid high levels of unemployment, and give veterans the opportunity to receive the education and training that they missed while bravely serving in the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To achieve these goals, the post-World War II G.I. bill paid for veterans' tuition, books, fees, and other training costs, and also gave a monthly stipend. After World War II, 7.8 million veterans used the benefits given under the original G.I. bill in some form, out of a wartime veteran population of 15 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last several decades, Congress subsequently passed several other G.I. bills, which also gave educational benefits to veterans. However, benefits awarded under those subsequent bills have not been as generous as our Nation's original G.I. bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, veterans' educational benefits are administered under the Montgomery G.I. bill. This program periodically adjusts veterans' educational benefits, but the program is designed primarily for peacetime--not wartime--service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, now our Nation is fighting a worldwide war against terrorism. Since 9/11, we have witnessed a sharp increase in the demands placed upon our military. Many of our military members are serving two or three tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. In light of these immense hardships, it is now time to implement a more robust educational assistance program for our heroic veterans who have sacrificed so much for our great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007 does just that. This bill is designed to give our returning troops educational benefits identical to the benefits provided to veterans after World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new benefits package under the bill I am introducing today will include the costs of tuition, room and board, and a monthly stipend of $1,000. By contrast, existing law under the Montgomery G.I. bill provides educational support of up to $1,000 per month for four years, totaling $9,000 for each academic year. This benefit simply is insufficient after 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, costs of tuition, room, and board for an in-state student at George Mason University, located in  Fairfax, Virginia, add up to approximately $14,000 per year. In addition, existing law requires participating service members to pay $1,200 during their first year of service in order to even qualify for the benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me briefly summarize some of the reforms that are contained in the bill I am introducing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, these increased educational benefits will be available to those members of the military who have served on active duty since September 11, 2001. In general, to qualify, veterans must have served at least two years of active duty, with at least some period of active duty time served beginning on or after September 11, 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next, the bill provides for educational benefits to be paid for a duration of time that is linked to time served in the military. Generally, veterans will not receive assistance for more than a total of 36 months, which equals four academic years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, as I mentioned a moment ago, my bill would allow veterans pursuing an approved program of education to receive payments covering the established charges of their program, room and board, and a monthly stipend of $1,000. Moreover, the bill would allow additional payments for tutorial assistance, as well as licensure and certification tests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, veterans would have up to 15 years to use their educational assistance entitlement. But veterans would be barred from receiving concurrent assistance from this program and another similar program, such as the Montgomery G.I. bill program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, under this bill, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs would administer the program, promulgate rules to carry out the new law, and pay for the program from funds made available to the Department of Veterans Affairs for the payment of readjustment benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I note that the benefits I have outlined today essentially mirror the benefits allowed under the G.I. bill enacted after World War II. That bill helped spark economic growth and expansion for a whole generation of Americans. The bill I introduce today likely will have similar beneficial effects. As the post-World War II experience so clearly indicated, better educated veterans have higher income levels, which in the long run will increase tax revenues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, a strong G.I. bill will have a positive effect on military recruitment, broadening the socio-economic makeup of the military and reducing the direct costs of recruitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps more importantly, better-educated veterans have a more positive readjustment experience. This experience lowers the costs of treating post-traumatic stress disorder and other readjustment-related difficulties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States has never erred when it has made sustained new investments in higher education and job training. Enacting the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007 is not only the right thing to do for our men and women in uniform, but it also is a strong tonic for an economy plagued by growing disparities in wealth, stagnant wages, and the outsourcing of American jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President I am a proud veteran who is honored to serve this great Nation. As long as I represent Virginians in the United States Senate, I will make it a priority to help protect our brave men and women in uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored that the Senate Majority Leader has agreed to join with me to be a defender and advocate of our veterans. The Majority Leader has included the concepts of the bill I introduce today in his leadership bill designed to rebuild the United States military. Additionally, I plan to work closely with Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman AKAKA--and all of my Senate colleagues--to statutorily update G.I. benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together we can provide the deserving veterans of the 9/11 with the same program of benefits that our fathers and grandfathers received after World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask that the bill I introduce today--the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007--be printed in the RECORD along with this statement.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="Introducing S. 23. A bill to promote renewable fuel and energy security of the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="23">S. 23</bill>] Mr. President, over the past several years, our national energy security has deteriorated rapidly. Petroleum and natural gas prices have gone up and appear to be staying up. Almost daily, we hear projections of increases in electricity prices around the country. The environmental impacts of energy use, especially from autos and power plants, are still a major health concern. The evidence of climate change is absolutely clear and very ominous, especially in the disappearance of glaciers,  the break up of polar ice sheets and the increasing intensity of storms. We know that combustion of fossil fuels is the primary contributor of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases emissions that drive this global warming. Despite these negative consequences, our dependence on petroleum is rising steadily, and we are importing over 60 percent</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen waxing and waning concerns about our national energy economy now for over 30 years. Many of us have believed all along that we should be doing more to promote energy efficiency and to accelerate the development and use of clean, domestic renewable energy, but during most of that time, cheap energy supplies have lulled us into relatively minimal actions. Over the past three years, however, there has been an increasingly acute awareness of the dire nature of our overall energy situation.  It is now clear that our energy situation is a serious threat not only to our economy but to our national security. We can no longer postpone action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I am joined by my esteemed colleagues, Senator Lugar of Indiana, Senator Dorgan of North Dakota, Senator Biden of Delaware, and Senator  Obama of Illinois, in introducing the Biofuels Security Act of 2007. This bill directly addresses one of the most critical pieces of a sound national energy transition policy. It charts a clear path forward for significantly increasing our national use of renewable fuels over the  next 24 years, reaching a total of 30 billion gallons per year by 2020, and 60 billion gallons per year by 2030. That latter figure represents about one-third of our nation's current annual fuel use for highway transportation. The production of the two most common forms of biofuels, ethanol and biodiesel, is expanding rapidly. We have reason to believe that this provision will provide strong impetus to increasing</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also will ensure that the vehicles to use these renewable fuels are readily available by requiring auto manufacturers over time to produce and sell increasing numbers of dual-fuel vehicles--that is, vehicles that can be fueled by gasoline or gasoline/ethanol blends. Because the turnover of vehicles on the highway takes many years, our bill requires the fraction of dual-fuel vehicles to increase from 10 percent in 2008 up to 100 percent in 2017 and beyond. In order to assure availability  of alternative fuels, our bill requires installation of increasing numbers of E-85 pumps by major oil companies at fueling stations that they own or license under their brand. These pumps will dispense E-85, a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline, which is a very</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I urge my Senate colleagues to join us in taking action to boost the transition to a cleaner, more resilient, and more secure energy economy. I request support for this bill and its rapid enactment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="Introducing S. 24. A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to require a health advisory and monitoring of drinking water for perchlorate; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="24">S. 24</bill>] Mr. President, I am introducing a bill that would require that tap water be tested for perchlorate, and would ensure the public's right to know about perchlorate in their drinking water. I am pleased that the senior Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, and the senior Senator from New Jersey, Mr. LAUTENBERG, have joined as original cosponsors of this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This toxin is a clear and present danger to California's and much of America's health, and EPA needs to get moving and protect our drinking water now. But until a perchlorate tap water standard is set, something must be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, my perchlorate monitoring and right to know bill will require that: EPA first swiftly set a health advisory for perchlorate that protects pregnant women, infants and children; second, that EPA order monitoring of drinking water for perchlorate until an enforceable standard is set; and, third, that the public be told about perchlorate and its health effects, if it is detected in their drinking water supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Drinking water sources for more than 20 million Americans are contaminated with perchlorate. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) says that perchlorate contamination has been found in water and soil at almost 400 sites in the U.S., with levels ranging from 4 parts per billion to millions of parts per billion. Perchlorate has polluted 35 States and the District of Columbia, and is known to have contaminated 153 public water systems in 26 States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we know, perchlorate can harm human health, especially that of pregnant women and children. Therefore, all citizens whose tap water system contains perchlorate have a right to know about that contamination, and about its potential health consequences. Only if their water is tested, and only if all systems are obligated to disclose the contamination and its health effects, will we be assured that the public is given the information that they deserve to protect themselves and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>EPA's original 1999 rule for monitoring of tap water for unregulated contaminants ordered testing for perchlorate. Just last year, on August 22, 2005, EPA proposed to extend the requirement that perchlorate be monitored in drinking water. However, on December 20, 2006, the Administrator reversed himself and signed a final rule removing perchlorate from the list of contaminants for which monitoring is required under the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation. I was shocked by this action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of this new rule, Americans will not be assured of up-to-date information on whether their tap water is contaminated with this toxin. Until EPA sets a tap water standard for perchlorate, at the very least we should know if it's in our drinking water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill will ensure that EPA acts swiftly to require water systems to test for and to inform the public about this threat to our health and welfare. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300061" topic="Introducing S. 25. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to establish requirements for certain petitions submitted to the Food and Drug Administration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="25">S. 25</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today on the first day of this new Congress to introduce the Citizen Petition Fairness and Accuracy Act of 2007. This legislation will help speed the introduction of cost-saving generic drugs by preventing abuses of the Food and Drug Administration citizen petition process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consumers continue to suffer all across our country from the high--and ever rising--cost of prescription drugs. A recent independent study found that prescription drug spending has more than quadrupled since 1990, and now accounts for 11 percent of all health care spending. At the same time, the pharmaceutical industry is one of the most profitable industries in the world, returning more than 15 percent on their investments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One key method to bring prescription drug prices down is to promote the introduction of generic alternatives to expensive brand name drugs. Consumers realize substantial savings once generic drugs enter the market. Generic drugs cost on average 63 percent less than their brand-name equivalents. One study estimates that every 1 percent increase in the use of generic drugs could save $4 billion in health care costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why I have been so active in pursuing legislation designed to combat practices which impede the introduction of generic drugs. The legislation I introduce today, which I first introduced last year with Senator Leahy in last Congress, targets one particularly pernicious practice by brand name drug companies to impede or block the marketing of generic drugs--abuse of the FDA citizen petition process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>FDA rules permit any person to file a so-called "citizen petition" to raise concerns about the safety or efficacy of a generic drug that a manufacturer is seeking FDA approval to bring to market. While this citizen petition process was put in place for a laudable purpose, unfortunately in recent years it has been abused by frivolous petitions submitted by brand name drug manufacturers (or individuals acting at their behest) whose only purpose is to delay the introduction of generic competition.  The FDA has a policy of not  granting any new generic manufacturer's drug application until after it has considered and evaluated any citizen petitions regarding that drug. The process of resolving a citizen petition (even if ultimately found to be groundless) can delay the approval by months or years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, FDA officials have expressed serious concerns about the abuse of the citizen petition process. In 2005, FDA Chief Counsel Sheldon Bradshaw noted that "[t]he citizen petition process is in some cases being abused. Sometimes, stakeholders try to use this mechanism to unnecessarily delay approval of a competitor's products." He added that he found it "particularly troublesome" that he had "seen several examples of citizen petitions that appear designed not to raise timely concerns  with respect to the legality or scientific soundness of approving a drug application, but rather to delay approval by compelling the agency to take the time to consider the arguments raised in the petition, regardless of their merits, and regardless of whether the petitioner could have made those very arguments months and months before."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And a simple look at the statistics gives credence to these concerns. Of the 21 citizen petitions for which the FDA has reached a decision since 2003, 20--or 95 percent of them--have been found to be without merit. Of these, ten were identified as "eleventh hour petitions", defined as those filed less than 6 months prior to the estimated entry date of the generic drug. None of these ten "eleventh hour petitions" were found to have merit, but each caused unnecessary delays in the marketing  of the generic drug by months or over a year, causing consumers to spend millions and millions of dollars for their prescription drugs than they would have spent without these abusive filings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the expense these frivolous citizen petitions cause consumers and the FDA, under current law the government has absolutely no ability to sanction or penalize those who abuse the citizen petition process, or who file citizen petitions simply to keep competition off the market. Our legislation will correct this obvious shortcoming and give the Department of Health and Human Services--the FDA's parent agency the power to sanction those who abuse the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill will, for the first time, require all those who file citizen petitions to affirm certain basic facts about the truthfulness and good faith of the petition, similar to what is required of every litigant who makes a filing in court. The party filing the citizen petition will be required to affirm that the petition is well grounded in fact and warranted by law; is not submitted for an improper purpose, such as to harass or cause unnecessary delay in approval of competing drugs; and does  not contain any materially false, misleading or fraudulent statement. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services is empowered to investigate a citizen petition to determine if it has violated any of these principles, was submitted for an improper purpose, or contained false or misleading statements. Further, the Secretary is authorized to penalize anyone found to have submitted an abusive citizen petition. Possible sanctions include a fine up to one million dollars, a suspension or permanent revocation of the right of the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While our bill will not have any effect on any person filing a truly meritorious citizen petition, this legislation will serve as a strong deterrent to attempts by brand name drug manufacturers or any other party that seeks to abuse the citizen petition process to thwart competition. It will thereby remove one significant obstacle exploiting by brand name drug companies to prevent or delay the introduction of generic drugs. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="Introducing S. A bill to authorize the implementation of the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will bring to a close 18 years of litigation between the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Friant Water Users Authority and the U.S. Department of the Interior. It is identical to the bill that we introduced in the waning days of the 109th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This historic bill will enact a settlement that restores California's second longest river, the San Joaquin, while maintaining a stable water supply for the farmers who have made the Valley the richest agricultural area in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without this consensus resolution to a long-running western water battle the parties will continue the fight, resulting in a court imposed settlement. To my knowledge, every farmer and every environmentalist who has considered the possibility of continued litigation believes that an outcome imposed by a judge is likely to be worse for everyone on all counts: more costly, riskier for the farmers, and less beneficial for the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Settlement provides a framework that the affected interests can accept. As a result, this legislation has the strong support of the Bush Administration, the Schwarzenegger Administration, the environmental and fishing communities and numerous California farmers and water districts, including all 22 Friant water districts that have been part of the litigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In announcing the signing of this San Joaquin River settlement in September, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior praised it as a "monumental agreement." And when the Federal Court then approved the Settlement in late October, Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne further praised Settlement for launching "one of the largest environmental restoration projects in California's history." The Secretary further observed that, "This Settlement closes a long chapter of conflict and uncertainty  in California's San Joaquin Valley . . . and open[s] a new chapter of environmental restoration and water supply certainty for the farmers and their communities."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I share the Secretary's strong support for this balanced and historic agreement, and it is my honor to join with Senator Boxer and a bipartisan group of California House Members in introducing legislation to approve and authorize this Settlement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation indicates how the settlement forged by the parties is going to be implemented. It involves the Departments of the Interior and Commerce, and essentially gives the Secretary of the Interior the additional authority to: take the actions to restore the San Joaquin River; reintroduce the California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook Salmon; minimize water supply impacts on Friant water districts; and avoid reductions in water supply for third-party water contractors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the major benefits of this settlement is the restoration of a long-lost salmon fishery. The return of one of California's most important salmon runs will create significant benefits for local communities in the San Joaquin Valley, helping to restore a beleaguered fishing industry while improving recreation and quality of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation provides for improvements to the San Joaquin river channel to allow salmon restoration to begin in 2014. Beginning in that year, the river would see an annual flow regime mandated by the Settlement, with pulses of additional water in the spring and greater flows available in wetter years. There is flexibility to add or subtract up to 10 percent from the annual flows, as the best science dictates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A visitor to the revitalized river channel in a decade will find an entirely different place providing recreation for residents of small towns like Mendota, and a refuge for residents of larger cities like Fresno.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation I am introducing today includes provisions to benefit the farmers of the San Joaquin Valley as well as the salmon. In wet years, Friant contractors can purchase surplus flows at $10 per acre-foot for use in dry years, far less than the approximately $35 per acre-foot that they would otherwise pay for this water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to recirculate new restoration flows from the Delta via the California aqueduct and the Cross-Valley Canal to provide additional supply for Friant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's legislation also includes substantial protections for other water districts in California who were not party to the original settlement negotiations. These other water contractors will be able to avoid all but the smallest water impacts as a result of the settlement, except on a voluntary basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the restoration of flows for over 150 miles below Friant Dam, and reconnecting the upper River to the critical San Joaquin-Sacramento Delta, will be a welcome change for the more than 22 million Californians who rely on that crucial source for their drinking water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, restoring the San Joaquin as a living salmon river may ultimately help struggling fishing communities on California's North Coast--and even into Southern Oregon. The restoration of the San Joaquin and the government's commitment to reintroduce and rebuild historic salmon populations provide a rare bright spot for these communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to congratulating the parties for making a settlement that will enable the long-sought restoration of the San Joaquin River, I am mindful of and remain committed to progress in implementing and funding the December 19, 2000, Trinity River restoration record of decision and the Hoopa Valley Tribe's co-management of the decision's important goal of restoring the fishery resources that the United States holds in trust for the Tribe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Support of this agreement is almost as far reaching as its benefits. This historic agreement would not have been possible without the participation of a remarkably broad group of agencies, stakeholders and legislators, reaching far beyond the settling parties. The Department of the Interior, the State of California, the Friant Water Users Authority, the Natural Resources Defense Council on behalf of 13 other environmental organizations and countless other stakeholders came together and spent  countless hours with legislators in Washington to ensure that we found a solution that the large majority of those affected could support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In November of last year, California voters showed their support by approving Propositions 84 and 1E that will help pay for the Settlement by committing at least $100 million and likely $200 million or more toward the restoration costs. Indeed, this Legislation includes a diverse mix of approximately $200 million in direct Water User payments, new State payments, $240 million in dedicated Friant Central Valley Project capital repayments, and future Federal appropriations limited to $250 million.  This mix of funding sources is intended to ensure that the river restoration program will be sustainable over time and truly a joint effort of Federal, state and local agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to emphasize that the Federal funding in the bill is for implementation of both the Restoration Goal to reestablish a salmon fishery in the river, and the Water Management Goal to avoid or minimize water supply losses supplied by Friant Water Districts. It is critical to recognize that these efforts are of equal importance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of the day, I believe that this agreement is something that we can all feel very proud of, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to move quickly to approve this legislation and provide the Administration the authorization it needs to fully carry out its  legal obligations and the extensive restoration opportunities under the settlement.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300061" topic="Introducing S. 28. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to require the use of generic drugs under the Medicare part D prescription drug program when available unless the brand name drug is determined to be medically necessary; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="28">S. 28</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Generics First Act. This legislation requires the use of available generic drugs under the Medicare Part D prescription drug program, unless the brand name drug is determined to be medically necessary by a physician.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everywhere I go in Wisconsin, I see how prescription drug costs are a drain on seniors, families, and businesses that are struggling to pay their health care bills. They want help now and we can respond by expanding access to generic drugs. Generics, which on average cost 63 percent less than their brand-name counterparts, are a big part of the solution to health care costs that are spiraling out of control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The private and public sectors, as well as individuals, are seeking relief from high drug costs, and Senate Special Committee on Aging has heard some remarkable success stories from some who have turned to generic drugs. Last year, General Motors testified that, in 2005, they spent $1.9 billion dollars on prescription drugs, 40 percent of their total health care spending. Their program to use generics first, when a generic drug is available, saves GM nearly $400 million a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, millions of seniors exceeded the initial $2,250 Medicare drug benefit and fell into the "donut hole," where they had to pay the full price of their drugs. Using less expensive, but equally effective, generic drugs will keep seniors out of the "donut hole" longer and help them survive the gap in coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Generic drugs approved by the FDA must meet the same rigorous standards for safety and effectiveness as brand-name drugs. In addition to being safe and effective, the generic must have the same active ingredient or ingredients, be the same strength, and have the same labeling for the approved uses as the brand drug. Generics perform the same as their respective brand name product.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Modeled after similar provisions in many state-administered Medicaid programs, this measure would reduce the high costs of the new prescription drug program and keep seniors from reaching the current gap in coverage or "donut hole" by guiding beneficiaries toward cost-saving generic drug alternatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know generic drugs have the potential to save seniors thousands of dollars, and curb health spending for the Federal Government, employers, and families. And every year, more blockbuster drugs are coming off patent, setting up the potential for billions of dollars in savings. This legislation is one piece of a larger agenda I'm pushing to remove the obstacles that prevent generics from getting to market, and making sure that every senior, every family, every business, and every government  program knows the value of generics and uses them to bring costs down. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="Introducing S. 29. A bill to clarify the tax treatment of certain payments made to homeowners by the Louisiana Recovery Authority and the Mississippi Development Authority; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="29">S. 29</bill>] Mr. President, at the end of the 109th Congress, I learned that the Internal Revenue Service had a tax surprise for citizens in my state of Louisiana and in Mississippi who are trying to rebuild after Katrina. This tax surprise will set back our recovery and discourage our citizens from coming home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me explain to my colleagues what I am talking about. Both Louisiana and Mississippi have established programs to help families rebuild their homes and their lives after Katrina and Rita. Congress appropriated the money for these initiatives--more than $10 billion in all, and we are very grateful for the assistance. The Louisiana program is called the "Road Home" and it is administered by the Louisiana Recovery Authority (LRA). The program is now starting to get going. Homeowners are eligible  to receive grants from the Road Home of up to $150,000 to help them rebuild or repair their homes. Rental properties are also eligible. Grants can also be used to buy out homes. The Louisianians who were displaced by the storms want to go home and the Road Home program will get them there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the IRS has dug a big pothole in the middle of the Road Home by making some of these payments taxable. The way this tax surprise works is by requiring that any hurricane victim who claimed a casualty loss deduction for damage to their home on their tax return for 2005 will have to reduce that loss by the amount of any payment from the LRA. So if they had their taxes reduced in one year and received a Road Home grant the next year, they have to essentially eliminate any benefit of the earlier  casualty loss deduction. Their taxes will go up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now I realize that under normal circumstances, when a person's home burns down, the roof caves in, or they are a victim of theft, they can take a casualty loss deduction, provided it meets certain requirements. The loss must exceed ten percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income, with a per loss floor of $100. In some circumstances, taxpayers are permitted to include a current-year casualty loss on an amended prior year return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Immediately after Katrina, we enacted the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act (KETRA) that suspended the ten percent floor for casualty losses incurred in the Hurricane Katrina disaster area, including those claimed on amended returns. The purpose of the change in KETRA was simple: we wanted to put money in the hands of Katrina victims as quickly as possible. We essentially encouraged taxpayers to take this casualty loss, even by amending a past return. The IRS would then provide them with a refund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was a very helpful proposal in the days immediately following Katrina, Mr. President. Hurricane victims needed that money. If you had lost your home, that money could help you pay for a place to live. Many hurricane victims lost their jobs and needed this money to see them through until they started working again. They used the money to begin the rebuilding of their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress encouraged people to take the new deduction by changing the law. Now the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>IRS wants to take it back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I fully understand the policy behind what the IRS is doing. Casualty loss deductions are normally reduced by the amount of any insurance or other recovery they make on the loss. In fact, at the time the taxpayer makes the deduction he or she is supposed to reduce the amount of the loss by any insurance recovery they reasonably expect to receive. If you receive a larger payment than you expected at a future time, you must claim it on your income tax return when you receive it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is that this policy will encourage people to leave Louisiana. If you took the casualty loss on your return, and you receive a $150,000 Road Home payment to rebuild your house, you will have a tax consequence. But if you took the casualty loss and sold your house to the LRA for the $150,000 payment, it is treated like a home sale and there is no tax. This policy creates a disincentive to recovery. The Road Home will become the Road Out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has done a tremendous job passing legislation to encourage investment and the rebuilding of the Gulf Coast. At the end of the last session we passed a tax extenders bill that contained a two-year extension of the bonus depreciation for investment in the most seriously damaged areas in the GO Zone. That investment is supposed to attract businesses and people to Louisiana and the Gulf. The IRS's actions will only keep people away. We should not put road blocks in the way of the Road Home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I am introducing legislation to eliminate this road block to our recovery and to clarify that Road Home payments are not to be taxed. The hurricanes in 2005 were remarkable events causing unprecedented damage. As Congress has done in the past, we must continue to respond in unprecedented and innovative ways. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="Introducing S. 41. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide incentives to improve America's research competitiveness, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="41">S. 41</bill>] Mr. President, back in 1962, Marshall McLuhan wrote, "The new electronic interdependence recreates the world in the image of a global village." Certainly, 40 years later, that concept is truer than ever. As we prepare for the future in this global village, we need to affirm America's leadership role in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States accounts for one-third of the world's spending on scientific research and development, ranking first among all countries. While this is impressive, relative to GDP, though, the United States falls to sixth place. And the trends show that maintaining American leadership in the future depends on increased commitment to research and science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Asia has recognized this. Asia is plowing more funding into science and education. China, in particular, understands that technological advancement means security, independence, and economic growth. Spending on research and development has increased by 140 percent in China, Korea and Taiwan. In America, it has increased by only 34 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Asia's commitment is already paying off. More than a hundred Fortune 500 companies have opened research centers in India and China. I have visited some of them. I was impressed with the level of skill of the workers I met there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China's commitment to research, at $60 billion in expenditures, is dramatic by any measure. Over the last few years, China has doubled the share of its economy that it invests in research. China intends to double the amount  committed to basic research in the next decade. Currently, only America beats out China in numbers of researchers in the workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I am pleased to introduce the Research Competitiveness Act of 2007. This bill would improve our research competitiveness in four major areas. All four address incentives in our tax code. Government also supports research through federal spending. But I am not addressing those areas today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, my bill improves and simplifies the credit for applied research in section 41 of the tax code. This credit has grown to be overly complex, both for taxpayers and the IRS. Beginning in 2008, my bill would create a simpler 20 percent credit for qualifying research expenses that exceed 50 percent of the average expenses for the prior 3 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And just as important: The bill makes the credit permanent. Because the credit has been temporary, it has simply not been as effective as it could be. Since its creation in 1981, it has been extended 11 times. Congress even allowed it to lapse during one period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The credit last expired in December of 2005. After much consternation and delay, Congress passed a two-year extension just last month, extending the credit for 2006 and 2007. These temporary extensions have taken their toll on taxpayers. In 2005, the experts at the Joint Committee on Taxation wrote: "Perhaps the greatest criticism of the R&amp;E credit among  taxpayers regards its temporary nature." Joint Tax went on to say, "A credit of longer duration may more successfully induce additional research than would a temporary credit, even if the temporary credit is periodically renewed."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, there are three different ways to claim a tax credit for qualifying research expenses. First, the "traditional" credit relies on incremental increases in expenses compared to a mid-1980s base period. Second, the "alternative incremental" credit measures the increase in research over the average of the prior 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both of these credits have base periods involving gross receipts. Under the new tax bill enacted last month, a third formula was created, which does not rely on gross receipts and is available only for 2007. My bill simplifies these credits by using this new credit only, known as the "Alternative Simplified Credit," based on research spending without reference to gross receipts. The current formulas hurt companies that have fluctuating sales. And it hurts companies that take on a new line of  business not dependent on research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new, simpler formula in my bill would not start until 2008. That start date would give companies plenty of time to adjust their accounting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The main complaint about the existing credits is that they are very complex, particularly the reference to the 20-year-old base period. This base period creates problems for the taxpayer in trying to calculate the credit. And it creates problems for the IRS in trying to administer and audit those claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new credit focuses only on expenses, not gross receipts. And it is still an incremental credit, so that companies must continue to increase research spending over time. Further, this bill adds a mandate for a Treasury study to look at substantiation issues and ensure that current recordkeeping requirements assist the IRS without unduly burdening the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A tax credit is a cost-effective way to promote R&amp;E. A report by the Congressional Research Service finds that without government support, investment in R&amp;E would fall short of the socially optimal amount. Thus CRS endorses Government policies to boost private sector R&amp;E.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, American workers who are engaged in R&amp;E activities benefit from some of the most intellectually stimulating, high-paying, high-skilled jobs in the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My own State of Montana has excellent examples of this economic activity. During the 1990s, about 400 establishments in Montana provided high-technology services, at an average wage of about $35,000 per year. These jobs paid nearly 80 percent more than the average private sector wage, which was less than $20,000 a year during the same period. Many of these jobs would never have been created without the assistance of the R&amp;E credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My research bill would also establish a uniform reimbursement rate for all contract and consortia R&amp;E. It would provide that 80 percent of expenses for research performed for the taxpayer by other parties count as qualifying research expenses under the regular credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, when a taxpayer pays someone else to perform research for the taxpayer, the taxpayer can claim one of three rates in order to determine how much the taxpayer can include for the research credit. The lower amount is meant to assure overhead expenses that normally do not qualify for the R&amp;E credit are not counted. Different rates, however, create unnecessary complexity. Therefore, my bill creates a uniform rate of 80 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second major research area that this bill addresses is the need to enhance and simplify the credit for basic research. This credit benefits universities and other entities committed to basic research. And it benefits the companies or individuals who donate to them. My bill provides that payments under the university basic research credit would count as contractor expenses at the rate of 100 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current formula for calculating the university basic research credit--defined as research "for the advancement of science with no specific commercial objective"--is even more complex than the regular traditional R&amp;E credit. Because of this complexity, this credit costs less than one-half of 1 percent of the cost of the regular R&amp;E credit. It is completely underutilized. It needs to be simplified to encourage businesses to give more for basic research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American universities have been powerful engines of scientific discovery. To maintain our premier global position in basic research, America relies on sustained high levels of basic research funding and the ability to recruit the most talented students in the world. The gestation of scientific discovery is long. At least at first, we cannot know the commercial applications of a discovery. But America leads the world in biotechnology today because of support for basic research in chemistry and  physics in the 1960s. Maintaining a commitment to scientific inquiry, therefore, must be part of our vision for sustained competitiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Translating university discoveries into commercial products also takes innovation, capital, and risk. The Center for Strategic and International Studies asked what kind of government intervention can maintain technological leadership. One source of technological innovation that provides America with comparative advantage is the combination of university research programs, entrepreneurs, and risk capital from venture capitalists, corporations, or governments. Research clusters around Silicon Valley  and North Carolina's Research Triangle exemplify this sort of combination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Academies reached a similar conclusion in a 2002 review of the National Nanotechnology Initiatives. In a report, they wrote: "To enhance the transition from basic to applied research, the committee recommends that industrial partnerships be stimulated and nurtured to help accelerate the commercialization of national nanotechnology developments."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To further that goal, the third major area this bill addresses is fostering the creation of research parks. This part of the bill would benefit state and local governments and universities that want to create research centers for businesses incubating scientific discoveries with promise for commercial development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stanford created the nation's first high-tech research park in 1951, in response to the demand for industrial land near the university and an emerging electronics industry tied closely to the School of Engineering. The Stanford Research Park traces its origins to a business started with $538 in a Palo Alto garage by two men named Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard. The Park is now home to 140 companies in electronics, software, biotechnology, and other high tech fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, the North Carolina Research Triangle was founded in 1959 by university, government, and business leaders with money from private contributions. It now has 112 research and development organizations, 37,600 employees, and capital investment of more than $2.7 billion. More recently,  Virginia has fostered a research park now housing 53 private-sector companies, nonprofits, VCU research institutes, and state laboratories. The Virginia park employs  more than 1,300 people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The creation of these parks would seem to be an obvious choice. But it takes a significant commitment from a range of sources to bring them into being. To foster the creation and expansion of these successful parks, my bill will encourage their creation through the use of tax-exempt bond financing. Allowing tax-exempt bond authority would bring down the cost to establish such parks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Foreign countries are emulating this successful formula. They are establishing high-tech clusters through government and university partnerships with private industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back in 2000, a partnership was formed to foster TechRanch to assist Montana State University and other Montana-based research institutions in their efforts to commercialize research. But TechRanch is desperately in need of some new high-tech facilities. It could surely benefit from a provision such as this. I encourage my Colleagues to visit research parks in their states to see how my bill could be helpful in fostering more successful ventures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A related item is a small fix to help universities that use tax-exempt bonds to build research facilities primarily for federal research in the basic or fundamental research area. Some of these facilities housing federal research--mostly NIH and NSF funded projects--are in danger of losing their tax-exempt bond status. Counsel have notified some state officials that they may be running afoul of a prohibition on "private use" in the tax code, because one private party has a superior claim to  others in the use of inventions that result from research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The complication comes from a 1980 law. In 1980, Congress enacted the Patent and Trademark Law Amendments Act, also known as the Bayh-Dole Act. The Bayh-Dole Act requires the Federal Government to retain a non-exclusive, royalty-free right on any discovery. In order to foster more basic research through Federal-state-university partnerships, we need to clarify that this provision of the Bayh-Dole act does not cause these bonds to lose their taxexempt status. And my bill directs the Treasury Department  to do so. I understand that the Treasury Department is aware of this significant concern. Whether or not Congress enacts my legislation, I hope that the Treasury Department will clarify the situation soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fourth major area that my bill addresses is innovation at the small business level. Last year, representatives of a number of small nanotechnology companies came to visit me. They told me that their greatest problem was surviving what they called the "valley of death." That's what they called the first few years of business, when an entrepreneur has a promising technology but little money to test or develop it. Many businesses simply do not survive the "valley of death." I believe that  Congress should find a way to assist these businesses with promising technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nanotechnology, for instance, shows much promise. According to a recent report, over the next decade, nanotechnology will affect most manufactured goods. As stated in Senate testimony by one National Science Foundation official last year, "Nanotechnology is truly our next great frontier in science and engineering." It took me a while to understand just what nanotechnology is. But it is basically the control of things at very, very small dimensions. By understanding and controlling at that dimension,  people can find new and unique applications. These applications range from common consumer products--such as making our sunblocks better--to improving disease-fighting medicines--to designing more fuel-efficient cars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, to help these small businesses convert their promising science into successful businesses, my bill would establish tax credits for investments in qualifying small technology innovation companies. These struggling start-up ventures often cannot utilize existing incentives in the tax code--like the R&amp;E tax credit--because they have no tax liability and may have little income for the first few years. They need access to cheap capital to get through those first few research-intensive years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The credit in my bill would be similar to the existing and successful New Markets Tax Credit. The New Markets Credit has provided billions of dollars of investment to low-income communities across the country. In my bill, entities with some expertise and knowledge of research would receive an allocation from Treasury to analyze and select qualifying research investments. These investment entities would then target small business with promising technologies that focus the majority of their expenditures  on activity qualifying as research expenses under the R&amp;E credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In sum, my bill would boost both applied and basic research. It would boost research by businesses big and small. And it would foster research by for-profit and non-profits alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>McLuhan's quote about the global village was taken by many at the time as a wake-up call to a changing world. Since then, many more leaders in this village have emerged. Let us work to see that the next big technological advance is discovered here in America. Only through continued commitment to research can We ensure that it is.</paragraph>

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide health care practitioners in rural areas with training in preventive health care, including both physical and mental care, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="53">S. 53</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural Preventive Health Care Training Act, a bill that responds to the dire need of our rural communities for quality health care and disease prevention programs. Almost one fourth of Americans live in rural areas and frequently lack access to adequate physical and mental health care. As many as 21 million of the 34 million people living in underserved rural areas are without access to a primary care provider. Even in areas where providers  do exist, there are numerous limits to access, such as geography, distance, lack of transportation, and lack of knowledge about available resources. Due to the diversity of rural populations, language and cultural obstacles are often a factor in the access to medical care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Compound these problems with limited financial resources, and the result is that many Americans living in rural communities go without vital health care, especially preventive care. Children fail to receive immunizations and routine checkups. Preventable illnesses and injuries occur needlessly, and lead to expensive hospitalizations. Early symptoms of emotional problems and substance abuse go undetected, and often develop into full-blown disorders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An Institute of Medicine (IOM) report entitled, "Reducing Risks for Mental Disorders: Frontiers for Preventive Intervention Research," highlights the benefits of preventive care for all health problems. The training of health care providers in prevention is crucial in order to meet the demand for care in underserved areas. Currently, rural  health care providers lack preventive care training opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Interdisciplinary preventive training of rural health care providers must be encouraged. Through such training, rural health care providers can build a strong educational foundation from the behavioral, biological, and psychological sciences. Interdisciplinary team prevention training will also facilitate operations at sites with both health and mental health clinics by facilitating routine consultation between groups. Emphasizing the mental health disciplines and their services as part of the  health care team will contribute to the overall health of rural communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Rural Preventive Health Care Training Act would implement the risk-reduction model described in the IOM study. This model is based on the identification of risk factors and targets specific interventions for those risk factors. The human suffering caused by poor health is immeasurable, and places a huge financial burden on communities, families, and individuals. By implementing preventive measures to reduce this suffering, the potential psychological and financial savings are enormous.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="Introducing S. 54. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to provide for coverage of services provided by nursing school clinics under State medicaid programs; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="54">S. 54</bill>] Mr. President, today I introduce the Nursing School Clinics Act. This measure builds on our concerted efforts to provide access to quality health care for all Americans by offering grants and incentives for nursing schools to establish primary care clinics in underserved areas where additional medical services are most needed. In addition, this measure provides the opportunity for nursing schools to enhance the scope of student training and education by providing firsthand clinical  experience in primary care facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Primary care clinics administered by nursing schools are university or nonprofit primary care centers developed mainly in collaboration with university schools of nursing and the communities they serve. These centers are staffed by faculty and staff who are nurse practitioners and public health nurses. Students supplement patient care while receiving preceptorships provided by college of nursing faculty and primary care physicians, often associated with academic institutions, who serve as collaborators  with nurse practitioners. To date, the comprehensive models of care provided by nursing clinics have yielded excellent results, including significantly fewer emergency room visits, fewer hospital inpatient days, and less use of specialists, as compared to conventional primary health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill reinforces the principle of combining health care delivery in underserved areas with the education of advanced practice nurses. To accomplish these objectives, Title XIX of the Social Security Act would be amended to designate that the services provided in these nursing school clinics are reimbursable under Medicaid. The combination of grants and the provision of Medicaid reimbursement furnishes the financial incentives for clinic operators to establish the clinics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to meet the increasing challenges of bringing cost-effective and quality health care to all Americans, we must consider a wide range of proposals, both large and small. Most importantly, we must approach the issue of health care with creativity and determination, ensuring that all reasonable avenues are pursued. Nurses have always been an integral part of health care delivery. The Nursing School Clinics Act recognizes the central role nurses can perform as care givers to the medically  underserved.</paragraph>

Higher taxes that families had been told not to worry about are brought back because of the Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT. It is a monster that really cannot be improved. It cannot be made to  work right. It is time to draw the curtain on this monster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am pleased to join with my friend CHUCK GRASSLEY, and our fellow Committee colleagues, Senators SCHUMER, KYL, and CRAPO to introduce legislation today that will repeal the individual AMT. Our bill simply says that beginning January 1, 2007, individuals will owe zero dollars under the AMT. Further, our bill provides that individuals with AMT credits can continue to use those credits up to 90 percent of their regular tax liability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we don't act, in 2007, the family-unfriendly AMT will hit middle-income families earning $61,000 with three children. What was once meant to ensure that a handful of millionaires did not eliminate all taxes through excessive deductions is now meaning millions of working families, including thousands in my home State of Montana, are subject to a higher stealth tax. It is truly bizarre that we've designed a tax that deems more children "excessive deductions" and punishes duly paying your State  taxes. Already, 5,000 Montana families pay a higher tax because of the AMT. But this number could multiply many times over if we don't act soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only is the AMT unfair and poorly targeted, it is an awful mess to figure out. The National Taxpayer Advocate has singled out this item as causing the most complexity for individual taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, repeal does not come without cost and that cost is significant even if we assume the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts aren't extended. We are committed to working together to identify reasonable offsets. Certainly, I don't think we want a tax system unfairly placing a higher tax burden on millions of middle-income families with children. But it doesn't serve those families either if our budget deficit is significantly worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like Frankenstein's monster, the AMT brings a most unpleasant reaction from those whom it encounters. It is time we end this drama and repeal the AMT.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="Introducing S. 56. A bill to provide relief to the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada for settlement of certain claims against the United States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="56">S. 56</bill>] Mr. President, almost twelve years ago, I stood before you to introduce a bill "to provide an opportunity for the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada to have the merits of their claims against the United States determined by the United States Court of Federal Claims."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That bill was introduced as Senate Resolution 223, which referred the Pottawatomi's claim to the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims and required the Chief Judge to report back to the Senate and provide sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to enable the Congress to determine whether the claim of the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada is legal or equitable in nature, and the amount of damages, if any, which may be legally or equitably due from the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seven years ago, the Chief Judge of the Court of Federal Claims reported back that the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has a legitimate and credible legal claim. Thereafter, by settlement stipulation, the United States has taken the position that it would be "fair, just and equitable" to settle the claims of the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada for the sum of $1,830,000. This settlement amount was reached by the parties after seven years of extensive, fact-intensive litigation. Independently, the  court concluded that the settlement amount is "not a gratuity" and that the "settlement was predicated on a credible legal claim." Pottawatomi Nation in Canada, et al. v. United States, Cong. Ref. 94-1037X at 28 (Ct. Fed. Cl., September 15, 2000) (Report of Hearing Officer).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill I introduce today is to authorize the appropriation of those funds that the United States has concluded would be "fair, just and equitable" to satisfy this legal claim. If enacted, this bill will finally achieve a measure of justice for a tribal nation that has for far too long been denied.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the information of our colleagues, this is the historical background that informs the underlying legal claim of the Canadian Pottawatomi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The members of the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada are one of the descendant groups--successors-in-interest--of the historical Pottawatomi Nation and their claim originates in the latter part of the 18th century. The historical Pottawatomi Nation was aboriginal to the United States. They occupied and possessed a vast expanse in what is now the States of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, llinois, and Wisconsin. From 1795 to 1833, the United States annexed most of the traditional land of the Pottawatomi Nation  through a series of treaties of cession--many of these cessions were made under extreme duress and the threat of military action. In exchange, the Pottawatomis were repeatedly made promises that the remainder of their lands would be secure and, in addition, that the United States would pay certain annuities to the Pottawatomi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1829, the United States formally adopted a Federal the policy of removal--an effort to remove all Indian tribes from their traditional lands east of the Mississippi River to the west. As part of that effort, the government increasingly pressured the Pottawatomis to cede the remainder of their traditional lands--some five million acres in and around the city of Chicago and remove themselves west. For years, the Pottawatomis steadfastly refused to cede the remainder of their tribal territory.  Then in 1833, the United States, pressed by settlers seeking more land, sent a Treaty Commission to the Pottawatomi with orders to extract a cession of the remaining lands. The Treaty Commissioners spent 2 weeks using extraordinarily coercive tactics--including threats of war--in an attempt to get the Pottawatomis to agree to cede their territory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In exchange for their land, the Treaty of Chicago provided that the United States would give to the Pottawatomis 5 million acres of comparable land in what is now Missouri. The Pottawatomi were familiar with the Missouri land, aware that it was similar to their homeland. But the Senate refused to ratify that negotiated agreement and unilaterally switched the land to five million acres in Iowa. The Treaty Commissioners were sent back to acquire Pottawatomi assent to the Iowa land. All but seven  of the original 77 signatories refused to accept the change even with promises that if they were dissatisfied "justice would be done."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Treaty of Chicago, as amended, Article 4. Nevertheless, the Treaty of Chicago was ratified as amended by the Senate in 1834. Subsequently, the Pottawatomis sent a delegation to evaluate the land in Iowa. The delegation reported back that the land was "not fit for snakes to live on."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While some Pottawatomis removed westward, many of the Pottawatomis--particularly the Wisconsin Band, whose leaders never agreed to the Treaty--refused to do so. By 1836, the United States began to forcefully remove Pottawatomis who remained in the east--with devastating consequences. As is true with many other American Indian tribes, the forced removal westward came at great human cost. Many of the Pottawatomi were forcefully removed by mercenaries who were paid on a per capita basis government  contract. Over one-half of the Indians removed by these means died en route. Those who reached Iowa were almost immediately removed further to inhospitable parts of Kansas against their will and without their consent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Knowing of these conditions, many of the Pottawatomis including most of those in the Wisconsin Band vigorously resisted forced removal. To avoid Federal troops and mercenaries, much of the Wisconsin Band ultimately found it necessary to flee to Canada. They were often pursued to the border by government troops, government-paid mercenaries or both. Official files of the Canadian and United States governments disclose that many Pottawatomis were forced to leave their homes without their horses  or any of their possessions other than the clothes on their backs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the late 1830s, the government refused payment of annuities to any Pottawatomi groups that had not removed west. In the 1860s, members of the Wisconsin Band--those still in their traditional territory and those forced to flee to Canada--petitioned Congress for the payment of their treaty annuities promised under the Treaty of Chicago and all other cession treaties. By the Act of June 25, 1864 (13 Stat. 172) the Congress declared that the Wisconsin Band did not forfeit their annuities by not  removing and directed that the share of the Pottawatomi Indians who had refused to relocate to the west should be retained for their use in the United States Treasury. (H.R. Rep. No. 470, 64th Cong., p. 5, as quoted on page 3 of memo dated October 7, 1949.) Nevertheless, much of the money was never paid to the Wisconsin Band.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1903, the Wisconsin Band--most of whom now resided in three areas, the States of Michigan and Wisconsin and the Province of Ontario--petitioned the Senate once again to pay them their fair portion of annuities as required by the law and treaties. (Sen. Doc. No. 185, 57th Cong., 2d Sess.) By the Act of June 21, 1906 (34 Stat. 380), the Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior to investigate claims made by the Wisconsin Band and establish a roll of the Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis that  still remained in the East. In addition, the Congress ordered the Secretary to determine "the[] [Wisconsin Bands] proportionate shares of the annuities, trust funds, and other moneys paid to or expended for the tribe to which they belong in which the claimant Indians have not shared, [and] the amount of such monies retained in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the clamant Indians as directed the provision of the Act of June 25, 1864."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to carry out the 1906 Act, the Secretary of Interior directed Dr. W.M. Wooster to conduct an enumeration of Wisconsin Band Pottawatomi in both the United States and Canada. Dr. Wooster documented 2007 Wisconsin Pottawatomis: 457 in Wisconsin and Michigan and 1550 in Canada. He also concluded that the proportionate share of annuities for the Pottawatomis in Wisconsin and Michigan was $477,339 and that the proportionate share of annuities due the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada was $1,517,226.  The Congress thereafter enacted a series of appropriation Acts from June 30, 1913 to May 29, 1928 to satisfy most of money owed to those Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis residing in the United States. However, the Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis who resided in Canada were never paid their share of the tribal funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since that time, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has diligently and continuously sought to enforce their treaty rights, although until this congressional reference, they had never been provided their day in court. In 1910, the United States and Great Britain entered into an agreement for the purpose of dealing with claims between both countries, including claims of Indian tribes within their respective jurisdictions, by creating the Pecuniary Claims Tribunal. From 1910 to 1938, the Pottawatomi  Nation in Canada diligently sought to have their claim heard in this international forum. Overlooked for more pressing international matters of the period, including the intervention of World War I, the Pottawatomis then came to the U.S. Congress for redress of their claim.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1946, the Congress waived its sovereign immunity and established the Indian Claims Commission for the purpose of granting tribes their long-delayed day in court. The Indian Claims Commission Act (ICCA) granted the Commission jurisdiction over claims such as the type involved here. In 1948, the Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis from both sides of the border--brought suit together in the Indian Claims Commission for recovery of damages. Hannahville Indian Community v. U.S., No. 28 (Ind. Cl. Comm.  Filed May 4, 1948). Unfortunately, the Indian Claims Commission dismissed Pottawatomi Nation in Canada's part of the claim ruling that the Commission had no jurisdiction to consider claims of Indians living outside territorial limits of the United States. Hannahville Indian Community v. U.S., 115 Ct. Cl. 823 (1950). The claim of the Wisconsin Band residing in the United States that was filed in the Indian Claims Commission was finally decided in favor of the Wisconsin Band by the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Undaunted, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada came to the Senate and after careful consideration, we finally gave them their long-awaited day in court through the congressional reference process. The court has now reported back to us that their claim is meritorious and that the payment that this bill would make constitutes a "fair, just and equitable" resolution to this claim.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has sought justice for over 150 years. They have done all that we asked in order to establish their claim. Now it is time for us to finally live up to the promise our government made so many years ago. It will not correct all the wrongs of the past, but it is a demonstration that this government is willing to admit when it has left unfulfilled an obligation and that the United States is willing to do what we can to see that justice--so long delayed is not now  denied.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would just note that the claim of the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada is supported through specific resolutions by the National Congress of American Indians, the oldest, largest and most-representative tribal organization here in the United States, the Assembly of First Nations (which includes all recognized tribal entities in Canada), and each and every of the Pottawatomi tribal groups that remain in the United States today.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="Introducing S. 57. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to deem certain service in the organized military forces of the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines and the Philippine Scouts to have been active service for purposes of benefits under programs administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="57">S. 57</bill>] Mr. President, many of you know of my continued support and advocacy on the importance of addressing the plight of Filipino World War II veterans. As an American, I believe the treatment of Filipino World War II veterans is bleak and shameful. The Philippines became a United States possession in 1898, when it was ceded by Spain, following the Spanish-American War. In 1934, the Congress enacted the Philippine Independence Act, Public Law 73-127, which provided a 10-year  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="76">S76</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Commonwealth Army of the Philippines was called to serve with the United States Armed Forces in the Far East during World War II under President Roosevelt's July 26, 1941 military order. The Filipinos who served were entitled to full veterans' benefits by reason of their active service with our armed forces. Hundreds were wounded in battle and many hundreds more died in battle. Shortly after Japan's surrender, the Congress enacted the Armed Forces Voluntary Recruitment Act of 1945 for the  purpose of sending Filipino troops to occupy enemy lands, and to oversee military installations at various overseas locations. These troops were authorized to receive pay and allowances for services performed throughout the Western Pacific. Although hostilities had ceased, wartime service of these troops continued as a matter of law until the end of 1946.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite all of their sacrifices, on February 18, 1946, the Congress passed the Rescission Act of 1946, now codified as Section 107 of Title 38 of the United States Code. The 1946 Act deemed that the service performed by these Filipino veterans would not be recognized as "active service" for the purpose of any U.S. law conferring "rights, privileges, or benefits." Accordingly, Section 107 denied Filipino veterans access to health care, particularly for non-service-connected disabilities, and  pension benefits. Section 107 also limited service-connected disability and death compensation for Filipino veterans to 50 percent of what their American counterparts receive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 27, 1946, the Congress enacted the Second Supplemental Surplus Appropriations Rescission Act, which duplicated the language that had eliminated Filipino veterans' benefits under the First Rescission Act. Thus, Filipino veterans who fought in the service of the United States during World War II have been precluded from receiving most of the veterans' benefits that had been available to them before 1946, and that are available to all other veterans of our armed forces regardless of race,  national origin, or citizenship status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Filipino Veterans Equity Act, which I introduce today, would restore the benefits due to these veterans by granting full recognition of service for the sacrifices they made during World War II. These benefits include veterans health care, service-connected disability compensation, non-service connected disability compensation, dependent indemnity compensation, death pension, and full burial benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the years, I have sponsored several measures to rectify the lack of appreciation America has shown to these gallant men and women who stood in harm's way with our American soldiers and fought the common enemy during World War II. It is time that we as a Nation recognize our long-standing history and friendship with the Philippines. Of the 120,000 that served in the Commonwealth Army during World War II, there are approximately 60,000 Filipino veterans currently residing in the United  States and the Philippines. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Filipino veteran population is expected to decrease to approximately 20,000 or roughly one-third of the current population by 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Heroes should never be forgotten or ignored; let us not turn our backs on those who sacrificed so much. Let us instead work to replay all of these brave men for their sacrifices by providing them the veterans, benefits they deserve.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="Introducing S. 58. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the reduction in the deductible portion of expenses for business meals and entertainment; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="58">S. 58</bill>] Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to repeal the current 50 percent tax deduction for business meals and entertainment expenses, and to restore the tax deduction to 80 percent gradually over a five-year period. Restoration of this deduction is essential to the livelihood of small and independent businesses as well as food service, travel, tourism, and entertainment industries throughout the United States. These industries are being economically harmed as a result of the  50 percent tax deduction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Small businesses rely heavily on the business meal to conduct business, even more so than larger corporations. In releasing its study in May 2004, entitled he Impact of Tax Expenditure Policies on Incorporated Small Business, the Small Business Administration, SBA, Office of Advocacy, found that small incorporated businesses benefit more than their larger counterparts from the meal and entertainment tax deduction. According to the study, small firms that take advantage of the business-meal deduction  reduce their effective tax rate by 0.75 percent on average, while larger firms only receive a 0.11 percent reduction in the effective tax rate. More importantly, the study strongly suggests that full reinstatement of the business meal and entertainment deduction should be a major policy priority for small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Small companies often use restaurants as onference space to conduct meetings or close deals. Meals are their best and sometimes only marketing tool. Certainly, an increase in the meal and entertainment deduction would have a significant impact on a small business bottom line. In addition, the effects on the overall economy would be significant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accompanying my statement is the National Restaurant Association (NRA), State-by-State chart reflecting the estimated economic impact of increasing the business meal deductibility from 50 to 80 percent. The NRA estimates that an increase to 80 percent would increase business meal sales by $8 billion and create a $26 billion increase to the overall economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the NRA State by State chart and the text of my bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="Introducing S. 59. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to improve access to advanced practice nurses and physician assistants under the Medicaid Program; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="59">S. 59</bill>] Mr. President, today I introduce the "Medicaid Advanced Practice Nurse and Physician Assistants Access Act of 2007." This legislation would change Federal law to expand fee-for-service Medicaid to include direct payment for services provided by all nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and physician assistants. It would ensure all nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, and physician assistants are recognized as primary care case managers, and require Medicaid  panels to include advanced practice nurses on their managed care panels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Advanced practice nurses are registered nurses who have attained additional expertise in the clinical management of health conditions. Typically, an advanced practice nurse holds a master's degree with didactic and clinical preparation beyond that of the registered nurse. They are employed in clinics, hospitals, and private practices. While there are many titles given to these advanced practice nurses, such as pediatric nurse practitioners, family nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives,  certified registered nurse anesthetists, and clinical nurse specialists, our current Medicaid law has not kept up with the multiple specialties and titles of these advanced practitioners, nor has it recognized the critical role physician assistants play in the delivery of primary care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been a long-time advocate of advanced practice nurses and their ability to extend health care services to our most rural and underserved communities. They have improved access to health care in Hawaii and throughout the United States by their willingness to practice in what some providers might see as undesirable locations--the extremely rural, frontier, or urban areas. This legislation ensures they are recognized and reimbursed for providing the necessary health care services patients  need, and it gives those patients the choice of selecting advanced practice nurses and physician assistants as their primary care providers.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="Introducing S. 60. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide a means for continued improvement in emergency medical services for children; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="60">S. 60</bill>] Mr. President, today, along with my colleagues; Senators AKAKA, KENNEDY, CONRAD AND DORGAN, I introduce "The Wakefield Act," also known as the "Emergency Medical Services for Children Act of 2007." Since Senator Hatch and I worked toward authorization of EMSC in 1984, this program has become the impetus for improving children's emergency services Nationwide. From specialized training for emergency care providers to ensuring ambulances and emergency departments  have state-of-the-art pediatric sized equipment, EMSC has served as the vehicle for improving survival of our smallest and most vulnerable citizens when accidents or medical emergencies threatened their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It remains no secret that children present unique anatomic, physiologic, emotional and developmental challenges to our primarily adult-oriented emergency medical system. As has been said many times before, children are not little adults. Evaluation and treatment must take into account their special needs, or we risk letting them fall through the gap between adult and pediatric care. The EMSC has bridged that gap while fostering collaborative relationships among emergency medical technicians,  paramedics, nurses, emergency physicians, surgeons, and pediatricians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Institute of Medicine's recently released study on Emergency Care for  Children, indicated that our Nation is not as well prepared as once we thought. Only 6 percent of all emergency departments have the essential pediatric supplies and equipment necessary to manage pediatric emergencies. Many of the providers of emergency care have received fragmented and little training in the skills necessary to resuscitate this specialized population. Even our disaster  preparedness plans have not fully addressed the unique needs posed by children injured in such events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>EMSC remains the only federal program dedicated to examining the best ways to deliver various forms of care to children in emergency settings. Re-authorization of EMSC will ensure that children's needs will be given the due attention they deserve and that coordination and expansion of services for victims of life-threatening illnesses and injuries will be available throughout the United States.</paragraph>

A bill to amend chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code, to authorize the use of clinical social workers to conduct evaluations to determine work-related emotional and mental illnesses; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="61">S. 61</bill>] Mr. President, today I introduce the Clinical Social Workers' Recognition Act to correct a continuing problem in the Federal Employees Compensation Act. This bill will also provide clinical social workers the recognition they deserve as independent providers of quality mental health care services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clinical social workers are authorized to independently diagnose and treat mental illnesses through public and private health insurance plans across the Nation. However, Title V of the United States Code, does not permit the use of mental health evaluations conducted by clinical social workers for use as evidence in determining workers' compensation claims brought by federal employees. The bill I am introducing corrects this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a sad irony that federal employees may select a clinical social worker through their health plans to provide mental health services, but may not go to this same professional for workers' compensation evaluations. The failure to recognize the validity of evaluations provided by clinical social workers unnecessarily limits federal employees' selection of a provider to conduct the workers' compensation mental health evaluations. Lack of this recognition may well impose an undue burden on Federal  employees where clinical social workers are the only available providers of mental health care.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="Introducing S. 62. A bill to treat certain hospital support organizations as qualified organizaitons for purposes of determining acquisition indebtedness; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="62">S. 62</bill>] Mr. President, the legislation I have introduced will extend to qualified teaching hospital support organizations the existing debt-financed safe harbor rule. Congress enacted that rule to support the public service activities of tax-exempt schools, universities, pension funds, and consortia of such institutions. Our teaching hospitals require similar support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A New York Times article on June 21, 2002, described the financial problems which nonprofit hospitals are facing to modernize their facilities and meet the growing demand for charitable medical care. The problems have grown more urgent since that article appeared.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On November 22, 2006, the Wall Street Journal noted the rising numbers of uninsured patients who fill hospital emergency rooms without paying their bills. In 2005, 46.6 million Americans had no health insurance. Compounding the growing demand for charitable care, new safety and infection-prevention standards require hospitals to undertake massive improvements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, the article stated, for-profit hospitals are moving from older areas to affluent locations where residents can afford to pay for treatment. These private hospitals, the reporter pointed out, typically have no mandate for community service. In contrast, nonprofit hospitals must fulfill a community service requirement. They must stretch their resources to provide increased charitable care, update their facilities, and maintain skilled staffing. Both the Wall Street Journal and the  New York Times noted the resulting closures of nonprofit hospitals due to this financial strain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is particularly severe for teaching hospitals. As the Times article said, nonprofit hospitals provide nearly all the postgraduate medical education in the United States. Post-graduate medical instruction is by nature not profitable. Instruction in the treatment of mental disorders and trauma is especially costly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite their financial problem the nation's nonprofit hospitals strive to deliver a very high level of service. A study in the December 2006 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine had surveyed hospitals' qualify of care in four areas of treatment. It found that nonprofit hospitals consistently outperformed for-profit hospitals. It also found that teaching hospitals had a higher level of performance in treatment and diagnosis. It said that investment in technology and staffing leads to better  care. And it recommended that alternative payments and sources of payments be considered to finance these improvements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The success and financial constraints of nonprofit teaching hospitals is evident in the work of the Queen's Health Systems in my State. This 146-year-old organization maintains the largest, private, nonprofit hospital in Hawaii. It serves as the primary clinical teaching facility for the University of Hawaii's medical residency programs in medicine, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, obstetrics-gynecology, pathology, and psychiatry. It conducts educational and training programs for nurses and  allied health personnel. It operates the only trauma unit as well as the chief behavioral health program in the State. It maintains clinics throughout Hawaii, health programs for Native Hawaiians, and a small hospital on a rural, economically depressed island. Its medical reference library</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past, the Congress has allowed tax-exempt schools, colleges, universities, and pension funds to invest their endowment in real estate so as to better meet their financial needs. Under the tax code these organizations can incur debt for real estate investments without triggering the tax on unrelated business activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the Queen's Health Systems were part of a university, it could borrow without incurring an unrelated business income tax. Not being part of a university, however, a teaching hospital and its support organization run into the tax code's debt financing prohibition. Nonprofit teaching hospitals have the same if not more pressing needs as universities, school, and pension trusts. The same safe harbor rule should be extended to teaching hospitals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill would allow the support organizations for qualified teaching hospitals to engage in limited borrowing to enhance their endowment income. The proposal for teaching hospitals is actually more restricted than current law for schools, universities, and pension trusts. Under safeguards developed by the Joint Committee on Taxation staff, a support organization for a teaching hospital can not buy and develop land on a commercial basis. The proposal is tied directly to the organization endowment.  The staff's revenue estimate show that the provision with its general application will help a number a teaching hospitals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Senate several times has acted favorably on this proposal. The Senate adopted a similar provision in <bill type="h" number="1836">H.R. 1836</bill> the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Act of 2001. The House conferees on that bill, however, objected that the provision was unrelated to the bill's focus on individual tax relief and the conference deleted the provision from the final legislation. Subsequently, the Finance Committee included the provision in <bill type="h" number="7">H.R. 7</bill> the CARE Act of 2002 and in <bill type="s" number="476">S. 476</bill> the CARE Act of 2003 which  the Senate passed.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to remove the restriction that a clinical psychologist or clinical social worker provide services in a comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility to a patient only under the care of a physician; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="63">S. 63</bill>] Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to authorize the autonomous functioning of clinical psychologists and clinical social workers within the Medicare comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my judgment, it is unfortunate that Medicare requires clinical supervision of the services provided by certain health professionals and does not allow them to function to the full extent of their state practice licenses. Those who need the services of outpatient rehabilitation facilities should have access to a wide range of social and behavioral science expertise. Clinical psychologists and clinical social workers are recognized as independent providers of mental health care services under  the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, the TRICARE Military Health Program of the Uniformed Services, the Medicare (Part B) Program, and numerous private insurance plans. This legislation will ensure that these qualified professionals achieve the same recognition under the Medicare comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility program.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="64">S. 64</bill>] Mr. President, on behalf of our Nation's clinical social workers, I am introducing legislation to amend the Public Health Service Act. This legislation would: 1. establish a new social work training program, 2. ensure that social work students are eligible for support under the Health Careers Opportunity Program, 3. provide social work schools with eligibility for support under the Minority Centers of Excellence programs, 4. permit schools offering degrees in social work to obtain  grants for training projects in geriatrics, and 5. ensure that social work is recognized as a profession under the Public Health Maintenance Organization Act.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="Introducing S. 65. A bill to modify the age-60 standard for certain pilots and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="65">S. 65</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today, as an experienced pilot over age 60, along with my colleagues, Senator Stevens, Senator Lieberman and Senator Feingold, to once again introduce a bill that will help end age discrimination among commercial airline pilots. Our bill will abolish the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) arcane Age 60 Rule a regulation that has unjustly forced the retirement of airline pilots the day they turn 60 for more than 45 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bipartisan bill called the "Freedom to Fly Act" would replace the dated FAA rule with a new international standard adopted this past November by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) which allows pilots to fly to 65 as long as the copilot is under 60.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the adoption of the ICAO standard in November of this year, foreign pilots have been flying and working in U.S. Airspace under this new standard up to 65 years of age a privilege the FAA has not been willing to grant to American pilots flying the same aircraft in the same airspace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill may seem familiar; I have introduced similar legislation in the past two Congresses and I am dedicated to ensuring its passage this year. And it has never been more urgent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot continue to allow our FAA to force the retirement of America's most experienced commercial pilots at the ripe young age of 60 while they say to their counterparts flying for foreign flags "Welcome to our airspace."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of these great American pilots are veterans who have served our country and the flying public for decades. Many of them have suffered wage concessions and lost their pensions as the airline industry has faced hard times and bankruptcies. But these American pilots are not asking for a handout.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are just saying to the FAA; "Give me the same right you granted our foreign counterparts with the stroke of a pen this November. Let us continue to fly, continue to work, continue to contribute to the tax rolls for an additional 5 years." We join them and echo their sentiments to FAA Administrator Blakey. As far as we are concerned, that is the least we can do for America's pilots, who are considered the best and the safest pilots in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most nations have abolished mandatory age 60 retirement rules. Many countries, including Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have no upper age limit at all and consider an age-based retirement rule discriminatory. Sadly though, the United States was one of only four member countries of ICAO, along with Pakistan, Colombia, and France, to dissent to the ICAO decision to increase the retirement age to 65 last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Age 60 Rule has no basis in science or safety and never has. The Aerospace Medical Association says that "There is insufficient medical evidence to support restriction of pilot certification based upon age alone." Similarly, the American Association of Retired Persons, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Seniors Coalition, and the National Institute of Aging of NIH all agree that the Age 60 Rule is simply age discrimination and should end. My colleagues and I agree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the rule was implemented in 1960 life expectancies were much lower at just over 69 and a half years. Today they are much higher at more than 77 years. The FAA's own data shows that pilots over age 60 are as safe as, and in some cases safer than, their younger counterparts. In the process of adopting the new international standard, ICAO studied more than 3,000 over-60 pilots from 64 nations, totaling at least 15,000 pilot-years of flying experience and found the risk of medical incapacitation</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, a recent economic study shows that allowing pilots to fly to age 65 would save almost $1 billion per year in added Social Security, Medicare, and tax payments and delayed Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am encouraged by the progress that has been made. In the 109th Congress, the Senate Commerce Committee reported the modified bill with the ICAO standard favorably and the Senate Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Committee included a version of <bill type="s" number="65">S. 65</bill> in its bill. The FAA recently convened an Aviation Rulemaking Committee to study the issue of forced retirement. We have yet to see that report but it is our understanding  the report was persuasive enough that the Administrator is considering a change in the rule now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are encouraged by that, but we also know that legislation will be needed to direct the FAA to pursue these changes in a timely manner and in a way that will protect companies and their unions from new lawsuits that might arise as a result of the changes. Our bill accomplishes that. Whether the FAA decides to change the rule on its own or not, Congress needs to do the right thing and pass <bill type="s" number="65">S. 65</bill> to fully ensure that our own American pilots have the same rights and privileges to work at least  until age 65 that were accorded to foreign pilots over the age of 60 this fall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the rest of my colleagues to support the Freedom to Fly Act and help us keep America's most experienced pilots in the air.</paragraph>

This legislation would confirm the validity of their claims and further allow qualified individuals the opportunity to apply for military and veterans benefits that, I believe, they are entitled to.

    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="67">S. 67</bill>] Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill which is of great importance to a group of patriotic Americans. This legislation is designed to extend space-available travel privileges on military aircraft to those who have been totally disabled in the service of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, retired members of the Armed Services are permitted to travel on a space-available basis on non-scheduled military flights within the continental United States, and on scheduled overseas flights operated by the Military Airlift Command.

    <paragraph>We owe these heroic men and women who have given so much to our country a debt of gratitude. Of course, we can never repay them for the sacrifices they have made on behalf of our Nation, but we can surely try to make their lives more pleasant and fulfilling.

  <speaking speaker="300061" topic="Introducing S. 69. A bill to authorize appropriations for the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="69">S. 69</bill>] Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kohl-Snowe legislation which would fund the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, MEP, for fiscal year 2008-fiscal year 2012. I am a long-time supporter of the MEP program and believe manufacturing is crucial to the U.S. economy. American manufacturers are a cornerstone of the American economy and embody the best in American values. A healthy manufacturing sector is key to better jobs, rising productivity and higher standards of living in the United  States. Every individual and industry depends on manufactured goods. In addition, innovations and productivity gains in the manufacturing sector provide benefits far beyond the products themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Small- and medium-sized manufacturers face unprecedented challenges in today's global economy which threaten the existence of manufacturing jobs in the United States. If it isn't China pirating our technologies and promising a low-wage workforce, it is soaring heath care and energy costs that cut into profits. Manufacturers today are seeking ways to level the playing field so they can compete globally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One way to level the playing field--and increase the competitiveness of manufacturers--is through the MEP program. MEP streamlines operations, integrates new technologies, shortens production times and lowers costs, leading to improved efficiency by offering resources to manufacturers, including organized workshops and consulting projects. In Wisconsin, three of our largest corporations--John Deere, Harley-Davidson, and Oshkosh Truck--are working with Wisconsin MEP centers to develop domestic  supply chains. I am proud to say that these companies found it more profitable to work with small- and medium-sized Wisconsin firms than to look overseas for cheap labor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You would be hard pressed to find another program that has produced the results that MEP has. In Wisconsin alone in fiscal year 2006, WMEP reported 2,696 new or retained workers, sales of $163 million, cost savings of $33 million, and plant and equipment investments of $37 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Manufacturing is an integral part of a web of inter-industry relationships that create a stronger economy. Manufacturing sells goods to other sectors in the economy and, in turn, buys products and services from them. Manufacturing spurs demand for everything from raw materials to intermediate components to software to financial, legal, health, accounting, transportation, and other services in the course of doing business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The future of manufacturing in the United States will be largely determined by how well small- and medium-sized companies cope with the changes in today's global economy. To be successful, businesses need state-of-the-art technologies to craft products more efficiently, a skilled workforce to meet the demands of modern manufacturers and a commitment from the government to provide the resources to allow companies to remain competitive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when economic recovery and global competitiveness are national priorities, I believe MEP continues to be a wise investment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="72">S. 72</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to amend Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to correct discrepancies in the reimbursement of clinical social workers covered through Medicare, Part B. The three proposed changes contained in this legislation clarify the current payment process for clinical social workers and establish a reimbursement methodology for the profession that is similar to other health care professionals reimbursed through the Medicare program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, this legislation sets payment for clinical social worker services according to a fee schedule established by the Secretary. Second, it explicitly states that services and supplies furnished by a clinical social worker are a covered Medicare expense, just as these services are covered for other mental health professionals in Medicare. Third, the bill allows clinical social workers to be reimbursed for services provided to a client who is hospitalized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clinical social workers are valued members of our health care provider network. They are legally regulated in every State of the Nation and are recognized as independent providers of mental health care throughout the health care system. It is time to correct the disparate reimbursement treatment of this profession under Medicare.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="Introducing S. 73. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for patient protection by establishing minimum nurse staffing ratios at certain Medicare providers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="73">S. 73</bill>] Mr. President, today I introduce the Registered Nurse Safe Staffing Act. For over four decades I have been a committed supporter of nurses and the delivery of safe patient care. While enforceable regulations will help to ensure patient safety, the complexity and variability of today's hospitals require that staffing patterns  be determined at the hospital and unit level, with the professional input of registered nurses. More than a decade of  research demonstrates that nurse staff levels and the skill mix of nursing staff directly affect the clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients. Studies show that when there are more registered nurses, there are lower mortality rates, shorter lengths of stay, reduced costs, and fewer complications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A study published in the Journal of The American Medical Association found that the risks of patient mortality rose by 7 percent for every additional patient added to the average nurse's workload. In the midst of a nursing shortage and increasing financial pressures, hospitals often find it difficult to maintain adequate staffing. While nursing research indicates that adequate registered nurse staffing is vital to the health and safety of patients, there is no standardized public reporting mechanism,  nor enforcement of adequate staffing plans. The only regulations addressing nursing staff exists vaguely in Medicare Conditions of Participation which states: "The nursing service must have an adequate number of licensed registered nurses, licensed practice (vocational) nurse, and other personnel to provide nursing care to all patients as needed".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will require Medicare Participating Hospitals to develop and maintain reliable and valid systems to determine sufficient registered nurse staffing. Given the demands that the healthcare industry faces today, it is our responsibility to ensure that patients have access to adequate nursing care. However, we must ensure that the decisions by which care is provided are made by the clinical experts, the registered nurses caring for these patients. Support of this bill supports our nation's  nurses during a critical shortage, but more importantly, works to ensure the safety of their patients.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="Introducing S. 82. A bill to reaffirm the authority of the Comptroller General to audit and evaluate the programs, activities, and financial transactions of the intelligence community, and for other purposes; to the Select Committee on Intelligence.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="82">S. 82</bill>] Mr. President, I rise to introduce "The Intelligence Community Audit Act of 2007," with Senator Lautenberg. This legislation reaffirms the authority of the Comptroller General of the United States and head of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to audit the financial transactions and evaluate the programs and activities of the intelligence community (IC).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill is identical to <bill type="s" number="3968">S. 3968</bill>, introduced in the last Congress by Senator Lautenberg and myself, and to <bill type="h" number="6252">H.R. 6252</bill>, introduced in the House by Representative Bennie Thompson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The need for more effective oversight and accountability of our intelligence community has never been greater. In the war against terrorism, intelligence agencies are both the spear and the shield: the first line of our attack and of our defense. Failure can bear terrible consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has two responsibilities: the first is to ensure that our intelligence community is performing its mission effectively, and the second is to ensure that in performing its mission, the intelligence community is not violating the constitutional rights of individual Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet the ability of Congress to ensure that the intelligence community has sufficient resources and capability of performing its mission has never been more in question. The establishment of the Department of Homeland Security and the passage of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 created a new institutional landscape littered by new intelligence agencies with ever increasing demands and responsibilities. These new agencies became members of an already populated club of  organizations performing intelligence related functions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The intelligence community today consists of 19 different agencies or components: the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; Central Intelligence Agency; Department of Defense; Defense Intelligence Agency; National Security Agency; Departments of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force; Department of State; Department of Treasury; Department of Energy; Department of Justice; Federal Bureau of Investigation; National Reconnaissance Office; National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency;  Coast Guard; Department of Homeland Security, and the Drug Enforcement Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress too has increased its oversight responsibilities. Committees other than the intelligence committees of the House and Senate have jurisdiction over such departments as Homeland Security, State, Defense, Justice, Energy, Treasury, and Commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But all of these "non-intelligence" committees are restricted in their ability to conduct effective oversight of intelligence function of the agencies under their jurisdiction because, unfortunately, the intelligence community stonewalls the Government Accountability Office (GAO) when committees  of jurisdiction request that GAO investigate problems. This is happening despite the clear responsibility of Congress to ensure that these agencies are operating  effectively to protect America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is inconceivable that the GAO--the audit arm of the U.S. Congress--has been unable to conduct evaluations of the CIA for over 40 years. If the GAO had been able to conduct basic auditing functions of the CIA, perhaps some of the problems that were so clearly exposed following the terrorist attacks in September 2001 would have been resolved. And yet, it is extraordinary that five years after 9-11, the same problems persist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two recent incidents have made this situation disturbingly clear. At a hearing entitled, "Access Delayed: Fixing the Security Clearance Process, Part II," before my Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia, on November 9, 2005, GAO was asked about steps it would take to ensure that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Office of Management and Budget, and the intelligence community met the goals and objectives outlined in  the OPM security clearance strategic plan. Fixing the security clearance process, which is on GAO's high-risk list, is essential to our national security. But as GAO observed in a written response to a question raised by Senator Voinovich, "while we have the authority to do such work, we lack the cooperation we need to get our job done in that area."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A similar case arose in response to a GAO investigation for the Senate Homeland Security Committee and the House Government Reform Committee on how agencies are sharing terrorism-related and sensitive but unclassified information. The report, entitled "Information Sharing, the Federal Government Needs to Establish Policies and Processes for Sharing Terrorism-Related and Sensitive but Unclassified Information" (GAO-06-385), was released in March 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when Congress is criticized by members of the 9-11 Commission for failing to implement its recommendations, we should remember that improving terrorism information sharing among agencies was one of the critical recommendations of the Commission. Moreover, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated the sharing of terrorism information through the creation of an Information Sharing Environment. Yet, when asked by GAO for comments on the GAO report, the Office  of the Director of National Intelligence refused, stating that "the review of intelligence activities is beyond GAO's purview."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Congressional Research Service memorandum entitled, "Overview of `Classified' and `Sensitive but Unclassified' Information," concludes, "it appears that pseudo-classification markings have, in some instances, had the effect of deterring information sharing for homeland security."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately I have more examples that predate the post 9-11 reforms. Indeed, in July 2001, in testimony, entitled "Central Intelligence Agency, Observations on GAO Access to Information on CIA Programs and Activities" (GAO-01-975T) before the House Committee on Government Reform, the GAO noted, as a practical manner, "our access is generally limited to obtaining information on threat assessments when the CIA does not perceives [sic] our audits as oversight of its activities."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill I introduce today does not detract from the authority of the intelligence committees. In fact, the language makes explicit that the Comptroller General may conduct an audit or evaluation of intelligence sources and methods or covert actions only upon the request of the intelligence committees or at the request of the congressional majority or minority leaders. The measure also prescribes for the security of the information collected by the Comptroller General.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As both House Rule 48 and Senate Resolution 400 establishing the intelligence oversight committees state, "Nothing in this [charter] shall be construed as amending, limiting, or otherwise changing the authority of any standing committee of the, House/Senate, to obtain full and prompt access to the product of the intelligence activities of any department or agency of the Government relevant to a matter otherwise within the jurisdiction of such committee."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite this clear and unambiguous statement, the ability of non-intelligence committees to obtain information, no matter how vital to improving the security of our nation, has been restricted by the various elements of the intelligence community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill reaffirms the authority of the Comptroller General to conduct audits and evaluations--other than those relating to sources and methods, or covert actions--relating to the management and administration of elements of the intelligence community in areas such as strategic planning, financial management, information technology, human capital, knowledge management, information sharing, and change management for other relevant committees of the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned earlier in my statement, Congress also has the responsibility of ensuring that unfettered intelligence collection does not trample civil liberties. New technologies and new personal information data bases threaten our individual right to a secure private life, free from unlawful government invasion. We must ensure that private information collected by the intelligence community is not misused and is secure. Intelligence agencies have a legitimate mission to protect the country  against potential threats. However, Congress' role is to ensure that their mission remains legitimate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="83">S. 83</bill>] Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senators SNOWE, BIDEN, AND LIEBERMAN in introducing the Rail Security Act of 2007. This legislation is nearly identical to the rail security measures approved by the Senate during both the 108th and 109th Congresses. Unfortunately, the House of Representatives has yet to act  on rail security legislation. I remain hopeful that rail security will be made a top priority for the  110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have taken important steps and expended considerable resources to secure the homeland since 9/11. I think all would agree that air travel is safer than it was five years ago. And, we have worked to address port security in a comprehensive manner. However, we need to do more to better secure other transportation modes, a fact well documented by the 9/11 Commission. Unfortunately, only relatively modest resources have been dedicated to rail security in recent years. As a result, our Nation's  transit system, Amtrak, and the freight railroads remain vulnerable to terrorist attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Rail Security Act would authorize a total of almost $1.2 billion dollars for rail security. More than half of this funding would be authorized to complete tunnel safety and security improvements at New York's Penn Station, which is used by over 500,000 transit, commuter, and intercity passengers each workday. The legislation would also establish a grant program to encourage security enhancements by the freight railroads, Amtrak, shippers of hazardous materials, and local governments with  responsibility for passenger stations. It would help to address identified security weaknesses in a manner that also seeks to protect the taxpayers' interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we continue fight the War on Terror, we need to do all we can to address our vulnerabilities. We have witnessed the tragic attacks on rail systems in other countries, including the cities of London, Mumbai and Madrid, and the devastating consequences of those attacks. It is essential that we move expeditiously to protect all the modes of transportation from potential attack, and this legislation will help to do just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned earlier, the Senate has consistently supported legislation to promote rail security. Most recently, rail security provisions were adopted last Fall as part of the port security legislation. But again, the House failed to allow these important security provisions to move ahead, and the provisions were stripped from the conference agreement. As a result, our rail network continues to remain vulnerable to terrorist attack. That is unacceptable in my judgement.</paragraph>

Simply put, this legislation would better protect  professional boxing from the fraud, corruption, and ineffective regulation that have plagued the sport for far too many years, and that have devastated physically and financially many of our Nation's professional boxers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For almost a decade, Congress has made efforts to improve the sport of professional boxing and for very good reason. With rare exception, professional boxers come from the lowest rung on our economic ladder. Often they are the least educated and most exploited athletes in our nation. The Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996 and the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act of 2000 established uniform health and safety standards for professional boxers, as well as basic protections for boxers against the  sometimes coercive, exploitative, and unethical business practices of promoters, managers, and sanctioning organizations. But further action is needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Professional Boxing Amendments Act would strengthen existing Federal boxing law by improving the basic health and safety standards for professional boxers, establishing a centralized medical registry to be used by local commissions to protect boxers, reducing the arbitrary practices of sanctioning organizations, and enhancing the uniformity and basic standards for professional boxing contracts. Most importantly, this legislation would establish a Federal regulatory entity to oversee professional  boxing and set basic uniform standards for certain aspects of the sport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Current law has improved to some extent the state of professional boxing. However, I remain concerned, as do many others, that the sport remains at risk. In 2003, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) spent more than six months studying ten of the country's busiest State and tribal boxing commissions. Government auditors found that many State and tribal boxing commissions still do not comply with Federal boxing law, and that there is a troubling lack of enforcement by both Federal and State  officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ineffective and inconsistent oversight of professional boxing has contributed to the continuing scandals, controversies, unethical practices, and unnecessary deaths in the sport. These problems have led many in professional boxing to conclude that the only solution is an effective and accountable Federal boxing commission. The Professional Boxing Amendments Act would create such an entity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Professional boxing remains the only major sport in the United States that does not have a strong, centralized association, league, or other regulatory body to establish and enforce uniform rules and practices. Because a powerful few benefit greatly from the current system of patchwork compliance and enforcement of Federal boxing law, a national self-regulating organization though preferable to Federal government oversight is not a realistic option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would establish the United States Boxing Commission, USBC or Commission. The Commission would be responsible for protecting the health, safety, and general interests of professional boxers. The USBC would also be responsible for ensuring uniformity, fairness, and integrity in professional boxing. More specifically, the Commission would administer Federal boxing law and coordinate with other Federal regulatory agencies to ensure that this law is enforced; oversee all professional boxing  matches in the United States; and work with the boxing industry and local commissions to improve the safety, integrity, and professionalism of professional boxing in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The USBC would also license boxers, promoters, managers, and sanctioning organizations. The Commission would have the authority to revoke such a license for violations of Federal boxing law, to stop unethical or illegal conduct, to protect the health and safety of a boxer, or if the revocation is otherwise in the public interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is important to state clearly and plainly for the record that the purpose of the USBC is not to interfere with the daily operations of State and tribal boxing commissions. Instead, the Commission would work in consultation with local commissions, and it would only exercise its authority when reasonable grounds exist for such intervention. In point of fact, the Professional Boxing Amendments Act states explicitly that it would not prohibit any boxing commission from exercising  any of its powers, duties, or functions with respect to the regulation or supervision of professional boxing to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of Federal boxing law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let there be no doubt, however, of the very basic and pressing need in professional boxing for a Federal boxing commission. The establishment of the USBC would address that need. The problems that plague the sport of professional boxing undermine the credibility of the sport in the eyes of the public and--more importantly--compromise the safety of boxers. The Professional Boxing Amendments Act provides an effective approach to curbing these problems. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="85">S. 85</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing the Indian Tribes Methamphetamine Reduction Grants Act of 2007. This bill is identical to <bill type="s" number="4113">S. 4113</bill>, a bipartisan measure that was passed by unanimous consent in the Senate on December 8, 2006, the last day of the 109th Congress. The legislation would allow Indian tribes to be eligible for funding through the Department of Justice to eradicate the scourge of methamphetamine use, sale and manufacture in Native American communities. I am  pleased to be joined by Senators Dorgan, Baucus, Grassley, Reid, Feinstein, and Feingold in introducing this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The impacts of methamphetamine use on communities across the Nation are well known and cannot be overstated. Methamphetamine is the leading drug-related law enforcement problem in the country. Unfortunately, the meth crisis is affecting Indian Country most severely. Very serious concerns have been raised by the U.S. Department of Justice, States, and other non-tribal law enforcement agencies over the rapidly growing levels of methamphetamine production and trafficking on reservations with large  geographic areas or tribes adjacent to the U.S.-Mexico border. But because of the sovereign status of the tribes, criminals are generally not subject to state jurisdiction in many cases. As a result, local law enforcement often has no jurisdiction in Indian country, and tribal law enforcement agencies bear the brunt of most law enforcement functions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem of meth in Indian country, which the National Congress of American Indians identified last year as its top priority, is ubiquitous, and has strained already overburdened law enforcement, health, social welfare, housing, and child protective and placement services on Indian reservations. Last year a former tribal judge on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine and other drugs. The day before, the Navajo Nation police arrested an  81 year old grandmother, her daughter, and her granddaughter, for selling meth. One tribe in Arizona had over 60 babies born with meth in their systems. In 2005, the National Indian Housing Council expanded its training for dealing with meth in tribal housing: the average cost of decontaminating a single residence that has been used a meth lab is $10,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the 109th Congress, as the Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, I held hearings on this serious matter. Committee witnesses testified that the methamphetamine epidemic in Indian country has contributed to a rise in child abuse and neglect cases, among other social ills, and some tribes reported dramatic increases in suicide rates among young people linked to methamphetamine use. Following our hearings, I was pleased to work with Senators Dorgan, Sessions,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To avoid any potential misinterpretation of the intent of this legislation, this bill includes language developed and agreed to during the last Congress that is designed to clarify the intent of the bill. This clarifying language, provided in section 2(a)(4) of the bill, is intended to make it clear that by authorizing the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Assistance to award grant funds to a state, territory or Indian tribe to "investigate, arrest and prosecute individuals" involved  in illegal methamphetamine activities, the legislation does not somehow authorize a grantee state, territory or Indian tribe to pursue law enforcement activities that it otherwise has no jurisdiction to pursue. And similarly, this provision also clarifies that an award or denial of a grant by the Bureau of Justice Assistance does not somehow allow a state, territory or Indian tribe</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation further clarifies that authority under the bill to award grants would have no effect beyond simply authorizing, awarding or denying a grant of funds to a state, territory or Indian tribe. So, for example, if a state, territory or Indian tribe is awarded or denied a grant of funds under this section, that award or denial has no relevance to or effect on the eligibility of the state, territory or Indian tribe to participate in any other program or activity unrelated to the award  or denial of grants as permitted under this legislation. The award or denial of a grant under this subsection, in other words, is relevant only to the award or denial of the grant under this subsection, and nothing else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure I am introducing today takes but a small step on the long journey toward our fight against methamphetamine. I encourage my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="86">S. 86</bill>] Mr. President, I am please to be joined by my colleague, Senator Kyl, in reintroducing a bill to designate Fossil Creek as a Wild and Scenic River. A companion measure is being introduced today by Congressman Renzi and other members of the Arizona congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fossil Creek is a thing of beauty. With its picturesque scenery, lush riparian ecosystem, unique geological features, and deep iridescent blue pools and waterfalls, this tributary to the Wild and Scenic Verde River and Lower Colorado River Watershed stretches 14 miles through east central Arizona. It is home to a wide variety of wildlife, some of which are threatened or endangered species. Over 100 bird species inhabit the Fossil Creek area and use it to migrate between the range lowlands and  the Mogollon-Colorado Plateau highlands. Fossil Creek also supports a variety of aquatic species and is one of the few perennial streams in Arizona with multiple native fish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fossil Creek was named in the 1800's when early explorers described the fossil-like appearance of creek-side rocks and vegetation coated with calcium carbonate deposits from the creek's water. In the early 1900's, pioneers recognized the potential for hydroelectric power generation in the creek's constant and abundant spring fed base-flow. They claimed the channel's water rights and built a dam system and generating facilities known as the Childs-Irving hydro-project. Over time, the project was  acquired by Arizona Public Service (APS), one of the state's largest eclectic utility providers serving more than a million Arizonans. Because Childs-Irving produced less then half of 1 percent of the total power generated by APS, the decision was made ultimately to decommission the aging dam and restore Fossil Creek to its pre-settlement conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>APS has partnered with various environmental groups, federal land managers, and state, tribal and local governments to safely remove the Childs-Irving power generating facilities and restore the riparian ecosystem. In 2005, APS removed the dam system and returned full flows to Fossil Creek. Researchers predict Fossil Creek will soon become a fully regenerated Southwest native fishery providing a most-valuable opportunity to reintroduce at least six Threatened and Endangered native fish species  as well as rebuild the native populations presently living in the creek.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a growing need to provide additional protection and adequate staffing and management at Fossil Creek. Recreational visitation to the riverbed is expected to increase dramatically, and by the Forest Service's own admission, they aren't able to manage current levels of visitation or the pressures of increased use. While responsible recreation and other activities at Fossil Creek are to be encouraged, we must also ensure the long-term success of the ongoing restoration efforts. Designation  under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act would help to ensure the appropriate level of protection and resources are devoted to Fossil Creek. Already, Fossil Creek has been found  eligible for Wild and Scenic designation by the Forest Service and the proposal has widespread support from surrounding communities. All of the lands potentially affected by a designation are owned and managed by the Forest Service and will not affect private property owners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fossil Creek is a unique Arizona treasure, and would benefit greatly from the protection and recognition offered through Wild and Scenic designation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="Introducing S. 95. A bill to amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act to ensure that every uninsured child in America has health insurance coverage, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="95">S. 95</bill>] Mr. President, today the first bill I am introducing in the 110th Congress is the Kids Come First Act, legislation that would ensure every child in America has health care coverage. The Kids Come First Act was also the first bill I introduced in the 109th Congress and I feel just as strongly today as I did at the beginning of the last Congress that insuring all children must be a top agenda item. In the two years since I last introduced this bill, the problem of uninsured children  in this nation has actually worsened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 110th Congress faces many challenges, from the war in Iraq to lobbying reform. But perhaps no issue bears more directly on the lives of more Americans than health care reform. Today 47 million Americans are uninsured, including 11 million under age 21. Health care has become a slow-motion Katrina that is ruining lives and bankrupting families all over the country. We cannot stand by as the ranks of the uninsured rise and American families find themselves in peril.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent Census Bureau report revealed that for the first time in almost a decade the number of uninsured children increased. In 2005 there were 361,000 children under the age of 18 added to the uninsured rolls. And the number of Americans without health care continues to rise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kids Come First Act calls for a Federal-State partnership to mandate health coverage to every child in America. The proposal makes the states an offer they can't refuse. The federal government will pay for the most expensive part: enrolling all low-income children in Medicaid, automatically. The states will pay to expand coverage to higher income children. In the end, states across the country will save more than $6 billion a year, and every child will have health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is totally unacceptable that, in the greatest country in the world, millions of children are not getting the health care they need. The Kids Come First Act expands coverage for children up to age of 21. Through expanding the programs that work, such as Medicaid and SCHIP, we can cover all eleven million children uninsured children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Insuring children improves their health and helps families cover the spiraling costs of insuring them. Covering all kids will reduce avoidable hospitalizations by 22 percent and replace expensive critical care with inexpensive preventative care. Also, when children get the medical attention they need, they pay much better attention in the classroom and studies show their performance improves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To pay for the expansion of health insurance for children, the Kids Come First Act includes a provision that provides the Secretary of Treasury with the authority to raise the highest income tax rate of 35 percent to a rate not higher than 39.6 percent in order to offset the costs. Prior to the enactment of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Act Reconciliation Act of 2001, the top marginal rate was 39.6 percent. Less than one percent of taxpayers pay the top rate and for 2007, this rate only  affects individual with income above $349,700.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The health care of our children is a priority that we must address and it can be done in a fiscally responsible manner. I will continue to work to find ways to offset the cost of my proposal. The wealthiest of all Americans do not need a tax cut when 11 million children do not even have health insurance. President Bush has called for this rate cut to be made permanent, but I believe it would be a better use of our resources to invest in our future by improving health care for children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since I first introduced the Kids Come First Act in the 109th Congress, more than 500,000 people have shown their support for the bill by becoming Citizen Cosponsors and another 20,000 Americans called into our "Give Voices to Our Values" hotline to share their personal stories. In addition, a coalition of 24 non-profit organizations representing 20 million people from across the country have endorsed Kids Come First, including the National Association of Children's Hospitals, the American  Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, March of Dimes, the Small Business Service Bureau, AFL-CIO, SEIU, and AFSCME.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear that providing health care coverage for our uninsured children is a priority for our nation's workers, businesses, and health care community. They know, as I do, that further delay only results in graver health problems for America's children. Their future, and ours, depends on us doing better. I urge my colleagues to support and help enacting the Kids Come First Act of 2007 during this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Kids Come First Act of 2007 be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="Introducing S. 96. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure a fairer and simpler method of taxing controlled foreign corporations of United States shareholders, to treat certain foreign corporations managed and controlled in the United States as domestic corporations, to codify the economic substance doctrine, and to eliminate the top corporate income tax rate, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="96">S. 96</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing the "Export Products Not Jobs Act." Our tax code is extremely complicated. In 1994, the IRS estimated that a family that itemized their deductions and had some interest and capital gains would spend 11 1/2  hours preparing their Federal income tax return. A decade later in 2004, this estimate increased to 19 hours and 45 minutes. It is time for Congress to pass bipartisan tax legislation in the style of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which greatly  simplified the tax code. And our tax reform should be based upon the following three principles: fairness, simplicity, and opportunity for economic growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Citizens and businesses struggle to comply with rules governing taxation of business income, capital gains, income phase-outs, extenders, the myriad savings vehicles, recordkeeping for itemized deductions, the alternative minimum tax (AMT), the earned income tax credit (EITC), and taxation of foreign business income. I believe that our international tax system needs to be simplified and reformed to encourage businesses to remain in the United States. And today, I am introducing legislation that  I hope will be fully considered as we continue our discussions on tax reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Presently, the complexities of our international tax system actually encourage U.S. corporations to invest overseas. Current tax laws allow companies to defer paying U.S. taxes on income earned by their foreign subsidiaries, which provides a substantial tax break for companies that move investment and jobs overseas. Today, under U.S. tax law, a company that is trying to decide where to locate production or services--either in the United States or in a foreign low-tax haven--is actually given  a substantial tax incentive not only to move jobs overseas, but to reinvest profits permanently, as opposed to bringing the profits back to re-invest in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recent press articles have revealed examples of companies taking advantage of this perverse incentive in our tax code. For instance, some companies have taken advantage of this initiative by opening subsidiaries to serve markets throughout Europe. Much of the profit earned by these subsidiaries will stay in the European countries and the companies therefore avoid paying U.S. taxes. Other companies have announced the expansion of jobs in India. This reflects a continued pattern among some U.S.  multinational companies of shifting software development and call centers to India, and this trend is starting to expand include the shifting critical functions like design and research and development to India as well. Some companies are even outsourcing the preparation of U.S. tax returns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Export Products Not Jobs Act would put an to end to these practices by eliminating tax breaks that encourage companies to move jobs overseas and by using the savings to create jobs in the United States by repealing the top corporate rate. This legislation ends tax breaks that encourage companies to move jobs by: 1. eliminating the ability of companies to defer, paying U.S. taxes on foreign income; 2. closing abusive corporate tax loopholes; and 3. repealing the top corporate rate. It removes  the incentive to shift jobs overseas by eliminating deferral so that companies pay taxes on their international income as they earn it, rather than being allowed to defer taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Congress, the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Revenue held a hearing on international tax laws. Stephen Shay, a former Reagan Treasury official, testified that our tax rules "provide incentives to locate business activity outside the United States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, he suggested that taxation of U.S. shareholders under an expansion of Subpart F would be a "substantial improvement" over our current system. The Export Products Not Jobs Act does just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our current tax system punishes U.S. companies that choose to create and maintain jobs in the United States. These companies pay higher taxes and suffer a competitive disadvantage with a company that chooses to move jobs to a foreign tax haven. There is no reason why our tax code should provide an incentive that encourages investment and job creation overseas. Under my legislation, companies would be taxed the same whether they invest abroad or at home; they will be taxed on their foreign subsidiary  profits just like they are taxed on their domestic profits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation reflects the most sweeping simplification of international taxes in over 40 years. Our economy has changed in the last 40 years and our tax laws need to be updated to keep pace. Our current global economy was not even envisioned when existing law was written.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My Export Products Not Jobs Act will in no way hinder our global competitiveness. Companies will be able to continue to defer income they earn when they locate production in a foreign country that serves that foreign country's markets. For example, if a U.S. company wants to open a hotel in Bermuda or a car factory in India to sell cars, foreign income can still be deferred. But if a company wants to open a call center in India to answer calls from outside India or relocate abroad to sell cars  back to the United States or Canada, the company must pay taxes just like call centers and auto manufacturers located in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, American companies allocate their revenue not in search of the highest return, but in search of lower taxes. Eliminating deferral will improve the efficiency of the economy by making taxes neutral so that they do not encourage companies to overinvest abroad solely for tax reasons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congressional Research Service stated in a 2003 report that, "[a]ccording to traditional economic theory, deferral thus reduces economic welfare by encouraging firms to undertake overseas investments that are less productive--before taxes are considered--than alternative investments in the United States." Additionally, a 2000 Department of Treasury study on deferral stated, "[a]mong all of the options considered, ending deferral would also be likely to have the most positive long-term  effect on economic efficiency and welfare because it would do the most to eliminate tax considerations from decisions regarding the location of investment."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The "Export Products Not Jobs Act" would modify the rules for determining residency for publicly-traded companies by basing a corporation's residence on the location of its primary place of management and control. This will prevent companies from locating in tax havens, but basically maintaining their operations in the United States. This provision should not hinder foreign investment in the United States. Existing companies that are incorporated in foreign countries with a comprehensive tax  treaty with the United States will not be affected by this provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Massachusetts is an example of a state that benefits from foreign investment. Two foreign companies have recently expanded investment in Massachusetts. Our tax system should not discourage foreign investment, but it should not encourage companies to locate in tax havens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The revenue raised from the repeal of deferral and closing corporate loopholes would be used to repeal the top corporate tax rate of 35 percent. The tax differential between U.S. corporate rates and foreign corporate rates has grown over the last two decades and the repeal of the top corporate rate is a start in narrowing this gap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Export Products Not Jobs Act would promote equity among U.S. taxpayers by ensuring that corporations could not eliminate or substantially reduce taxation of foreign income by separately incorporating their foreign operations. This legislation will eliminate the tax incentives to encourage U.S. companies to invest abroad and reward those companies that have chosen to invest in the United States. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort, and I ask unanimous consent that summary of the  Export Products Not Jobs Act, as well as the text of the legislation, be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="Introducing S. 97. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to replace the Hope and Lifetime Learning credits with a partially refundable college opportunity credit; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="97">S. 97</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing the College Opportunity Tax Credit Act of 2007. This legislation creates a new tax credit that will put the cost of higher education in reach for American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An October 2006 College Board report found that this year tuition and other costs at public and private universities rose faster than inflation. And, according to the report, tuition and fees at public universities rose more in the past five years than at any other time in the past 30 years, increasing by 35 percent to $5,836 this academic year. Over the same time period, tuition and fees at private universities increased 22 percent to $22,218.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, neither student aid funds nor family incomes are keeping pace with increasing tuition and fees. In my travels around the country, I frequently hear from parents concerned they will not be able to pay for their children's college. These parents know that earning a college education will result in greater earnings for their children and they desperately want to ensure their kids have the greatest opportunities possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1997, we implemented two new tax credits to make college affordable--the HOPE Credit and the Lifetime Learning Credit. These tax credits were important and have put college in reach for families, but I believe we can do more. In December, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on tax incentives for higher education in which we learned that the existing tax credits are not reaching enough students, particularly lower-income students who are most severely impacted by rising tuitions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The HOPE and Lifetime Learning credits are not refundable, and therefore a family of four must have an income over $30,000 in order to receive the maximum credit. Almost half of families with college students fail to receive the full credit because their income is too low. In order to receive the full benefit of the Lifetime Learning credit, a student has to spend $10,000 a year on tuition and fees. This is nearly double the average annual public four-year college tuition and four times the average  annual tuition of a community college. Over 80 percent of college students attend schools with tuition and fees under $10,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, I proposed a refundable tax credit to help pay for the cost of four years of college. Currently the HOPE Credit applies only to the first two years of college. The College Opportunity Tax Credit Act of 2007 (COTC) helps students and parents afford all four years of college. It also builds on the proposal I made in 2004 by incorporating some of the suggestions made by experts, including those at this  week's Finance Committee hearing. My legislation  creates a new credit that replaces the existing HOPE credit and Lifetime Learning credit and ultimately makes these benefits more generous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The COTC has two components. The first provides a refundable tax credit for a student enrolled in a degree program at least on a half-time basis. It would provide a 100 percent tax credit for the first $1,000 of eligible expenses and a 50 percent tax credit to the next $3,000 of expenses. The maximum credit would be $2,500 each year per student. The second provides a nonrefundable tax credit for part-time students, graduate students, and other students that do not qualify for the refundable tax  credit. It provides a 40 percent credit for the first $1,000 of eligible expenses and a 20 percent credit for the next $3,000 of expenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both of these credits can be used for expenses associated with tuition and fees. The same income limits that apply to the HOPE credit and the Lifetime Learning credit apply to the COTC; the COTC will be phased out ratably for taxpayers with income between $45,000 and $55,000 ($90,000 and $110,000 for married taxpayers). These amounts are indexed for inflation, as are the eligible amounts of expenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The College Opportunity Tax Credit Act of 2007 simplifies the existing credits that make higher education more affordable and will enable more students to be eligible for tax relief. I understand that many of my colleagues are interested in making college more affordable. I look forward to working with my colleagues to make a refundable tax credit for college education a reality this Congress. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="Introducing S. 98. A bill to foster the development of minority-owned small businesses; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="98">S. 98</bill>] Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this statement be printed in the record. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Minority  Entrepreneurship Development Act of 2007. At the beginning of a new Congress it is important to set priorities for the nation because every new Congress brings with it the hope for a brighter future. One of the ways that this new Senate will lead is by creating opportunities for more Americans to pursue  the American dream. As incoming Chair of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, I hope to help in that effort by fostering the development of entrepreneurship in minority communities. It's vital that current and future entrepreneurs from minority communities are given the opportunity to build their own piece of the American dream. I believe that this legislation the Minority Entrepreneurship Development Act of 2007 will help in that effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to take a moment and tell you why it's so important to expand the numbers of entrepreneurs in the minority community. As a member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have received firsthand testimony and countless reports documenting the positive economic impact that occurs when we foster entrepreneurship in under-served communities. There are signs of significant economic returns when minority businesses are created and are able to grow in size and capacity.  Between 1987 and 1997, revenue from minority owned firms rose by 22.5 percent, an increase equivalent to an annual growth rate of 10 percent. Employment opportunities within minority owned firms increased by 23 percent during that same period. There is a clear correlation between the growth of minority owned firms and the economic viability of the minority community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although these economic numbers tell a significant part of the story they don't tell the whole story of what these firms mean to the minority communities they serve and represent. Many of these business leaders are first generation immigrants; many are first generation business owners and many represent, for those in their communities, what hard work, determination and patience can do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must encourage those kinds of values in our minority communities and, quite frankly, in our nation as a whole. For generations, millions have come to our shores in search of a better life. Millions of others were brought here by force and for years were not given a voice in how their lives would turn out. But, how ever we got here, we all have become branches of this great tree we call America. This tree is still nourished by roots planted by our forefathers more than 200 years ago. Those  men and women planted the roots of hard work, innovation, faith and risk taking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you think about it, those words are the perfect description of an entrepreneur. It is the spirit of entrepreneurship that has made our nation great. And that is why it is absolutely imperative that we continue to support and develop that spirit in our minority communities. To that end, this legislation provides several tools to help minority entrepreneurs as they develop and grow their businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, this legislation will create an Office of Minority Small Business Development at the Small Business Administration. One of its primary functions will be to increase the number of small business loans that minority businesses receive. Latinos, African-Americans, Asian-Americans and women have been receiving far fewer small business loans than they reasonably should.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To ensure that this trend is reversed and minorities begin to get a greater share of loan dollars, venture capital investments, counseling, and contracting opportunities, this bill will give the new office the authority to monitor the outcomes for SBA's Capital Access, Entrepreneurial Development, and Government Contracting programs. It also requires the head of the Office to work with SBA's partners, trade associations and business groups to identify more effective ways to market to minority  business owners, and to work with the head of SBA's Field Operations to ensure that district offices have staff and resources to market to minorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, this legislation will create the Minority Entrepreneurship and Innovation Pilot Program. This program will offer a competitive grant to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, and Hispanic-Serving Institutions to create an entrepreneurship curriculum at these institutions and to open Small Business Development Centers on those campus' to serve local businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The goal of this program is to target students in highly skilled fields such as engineering, manufacturing, science and technology, and guide them towards entrepreneurship as a career option. Traditionally, minority-owned businesses are disproportionately represented in the service sectors. Promoting entrepreneurial education to undergraduate students will help expand business ownership beyond the service sectors to higher yielding technical and financial sectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, this legislation will create the Minority Access to Information Distance Learning Pilot Program. This program will offer competitive grants to well established national minority non-profit and business organizations to create distance learning programs for small business owners who are interested in doing business with the federal government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The goal of this program is to provide low cost training to the many small business owners who cannot afford to pay a consultant thousands of dollars for advice or training on how to prepare themselves to contract with the Federal Government. There are thousands of small businesses in this country that are excellent and efficient. They are primed to provide the goods and services that this nation needs to stay competitive. This program will help prepare them to do just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this legislation will extend the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business Program which expired in 2003. This program provides a price evaluation adjustment for socially and economically disadvantaged businesses as a way of increasing their competitiveness when bidding against larger firms. This is one more tool to increase opportunities for our minority small business owners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have outlined several ways that we can create a more positive environment for our minority small business community. These are reasonable steps that we ought to take without delay. Moreover, these are important steps that will help bolster a movement that is already underway. According to U.S. Census data, Hispanics are opening businesses 3 times faster than the national average. Also, business development and entrepreneurship have played a significant role in the expansion of the black middle  class in this country for over a century. These business owners are embodying the entrepreneurial spirit that our forefathers carried with them as they established this nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this legislation and in my role as incoming Chair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I hope to play a part in helping to extend that spirit to the next generation of entrepreneurs. Not only is this vital for our minority communities, but it is vital for America. I urge my colleagues to join with me in support of the Minority Entrepreneurship Development Act of 2007.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="Introducing S. 99. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue code of 1986 to provide a refundable credit for small business employee health insurance expenses; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="99">S. 99</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit Act which would provide small businesses with a refundable tax credit to help with the cost of providing employees with health insurance. Recent studies show that certain groups of individuals are less likely to have employer-provided health insurance. The 2006 Kaiser Family Foundation Employer Health Benefits Survey shows that since 2000 the number of firms offering health benefits has declined from 69  percent to 61 percent in 2006. This decline in coverage is more prevalent in small businesses. Only 48 percent of the firms with less than 10 employees offer health insurance whereas, 90 percent of the firms with 50 or more employees offer health benefits. Approximately 32 million Americans work for firms with fewer than 50 employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The April 2006 Commonwealth Fund Biennial Health Insurance Survey concluded that 41 percent of working-age Americans with incomes between $20,000 and $40,000 were uninsured for at least part of the past year. This reflects a dramatic increase in this income range, up from 28 percent in 2001. The survey found that of the 48 million American adults who were uninsured in the past year, 67 percent were in families where at least one person worked full time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation provides a refundable tax credit to small businesses designed to help provide coverage to those who are currently uninsured. Small businesses with less than 50 employees would be eligible to receive a tax credit to help with the cost of health care premiums for employees making more than $5,000 and less than $50,000 a year. To be eligible for the credit, the employer has to pay at least 50 percent of the health care insurance premium. The credit for businesses with fewer than 10  employees will be capped at 50 percent of the cost of the premium, and the credit amount decreases for larger businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, Leonard Burman, Codirector of the Tax Policy Center, testified before the Senate Finance Committee and suggested a refundable tax credit as an incremental option to help defray higher administrative costs faced by small employers in purchasing health care. This credit will help small businesses afford health care premiums. It is a refundable credit, so that it will help new businesses that do not yet have taxable income be able to offer health care and provide struggling businesses  with assistance so that they can offer health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This tax credit will cut the cost of health insurance by up to 50 percent for small business owners. It will enable small businesses to provide health insurance for their low- and moderate-income employees. Until we can agree on a comprehensive proposal that will help reduce the cost of health care premiums for small businesses, this legislation provides an appropriate option for increasing health insurance coverage for small businesses and their employees.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="Introducing S. 100. A bill to encourage the health of children in schools by promoting better nutrition and increased physical activity, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="100">S. 100</bill>] Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Healthy Students Act, a bill that addresses the rising epidemic of childhood obesity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past 30 years, obesity rates have doubled for teenagers and tripled for children ages 6 to 11. Today, more than 30 percent of children in America are overweight and more than 15 percent are obese. As a result, more children are suffering from traditionally adult diseases--including type 2 diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol--and putting their health in great danger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the reasons for the growing number of obese children problems are complex, the underlying problem is simple. Children are becoming obese because they are eating too much unhealthy food and getting too little exercise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vending machines are in too many of our schools. Children today eat five times as much fast food as they did 30 years ago. And the number of students who eat green vegetables "nearly every day or more" has dropped to only 30 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Children are getting too little exercise. Nearly 23 percent of children ages 9-13 do not engage in any free-time physical activity during the school day, and nearly 60 percent do not participate in any kind of organized sports or physical activity program outside of school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, the lack of qualified health professionals (school nurses)--compounded with the access to them--is taking an adverse toll on children's health in our public schools. With just one licensed nurse for every 1,155 students, too many children don't have access to a caring health care professional who can diagnose illness, administer medicine, handle emergencies, or treat injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should ensure that during the school day, children have access to better nutrition and health care, more physical activity, and the skills necessary for a lifetime of good health. And that's what the Healthy Students Act will do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the bill creates a commission of children's health experts to review existing school nutrition guidelines and develop new, healthier standards that provide more fresh fruits and vegetables and eliminate food of minimal nutritional value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the bill creates a grant program for school nutrition pilot programs that promote alternative healthful food promotion in its curriculum and lunch program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have seen firsthand what can be accomplished with such innovative programs. For example in Berkeley, California, the "Edible Schoolyard" program is changing the way kids eat and learn about nutrition. Schools in the Edible Schoolyard program maintain an organic garden and integrate the garden into both the curriculum and  lunch program. This hands-on approach educates students on healthy eating--from planting, to harvesting, to their plates. By teaching  kids about the connection between what they eat and where it comes from, we can help them develop good nutrition habits that will last a lifetime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, the bill creates a "Healthy Hour" pilot program that provides funding for an additional hour to the school day either before, after or during school--set aside specifically for physical activity. As more and more schools have cut recess and physical education classes, the bill provides funding for programs that extend physical activity time and highlight the importance of exercise for children in schools across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, to make sure that children have the equipment they need, the bill provides tax incentives to individuals and businesses to donate exercise and gymnasium equipment to schools and organizations serving students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And fifth, to address the shortage of qualified health care professionals in schools, the bill creates a tuition loan forgiveness program for those who earn a degree in nursing and make a minimum 3-year commitment to work in a public elementary or secondary school. We are saying to prospective nurses: If you make an investment in helping kids, then we will make an investment in you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Childhood obesity is a growing epidemic that we must address now. I urge my colleagues to support the Healthy Students Act to ensure that all children have the health they need to achieve their dreams.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="Introducing S. 102. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend and expand relief from the alternative minimum tax and to repeal the extension of the lower rates for capital gains and dividends for 2009 and 2010; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="102">S. 102</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which addresses the individual alternative minimum tax (AMT) for 2007. Last Congress, a choice was made to extend lower capital gains and dividends rates that do not expire until the end of 2008 rather than address the AMT for 2007. My preference was to address the AMT for 2007 and I believe we still must take action to prevent taxpayers never intended to pay the AMT from being penalized this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I opposed the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 because it contained the wrong priorities for America leaving behind working families and substantially adding to the deficit. This law extended the lower rates on capital gains and dividends for 2009 and 2010, but only addressed the individual AMT for 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, those earning $200,000 or more will receive 84 percent of the benefit of the capital gains tax cut and 63 percent of the benefit of the dividends tax cuts. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 42.8 percent of taxpayers with income between $50,000 and $100,000 will be impacted by the AMT if the AMT is not fixed for 2007 a number that increases to 66 percent by 2010. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation of Act of 2005 extends a tax  cut that does not expire to the end of 2008 with a price tag of $50 billion, but fails to protect the hard working families that will be impacted by the AMT. These families were never intended to be impacted by the AMT, a tax originally designed to prevent a small number of high-income taxpayers from avoiding taxation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I am introducing legislation that will address the AMT for 2007 and repeal the lower tax rates on capital dividends for 2009 and 2010. To calculate the AMT, individuals add back certain "preference items" to their regular tax liability. These include personal exemptions, the standard deduction, and the itemized deduction for state and local taxes. From this amount, taxpayers subtract the AMT exemption amount, commonly referred to as the "patch" which reverted to lower levels at the  end of 2005. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 increased and extended the patch for 2006. The patch was increased in order to hold the same number of taxpayers harmless from the AMT in 2006 as in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem with the AMT is that while the regular tax system is indexed for inflation, the AMT exemption amounts and tax brackets remain constant. This has the perverse consequence of punishing taxpayers for the mere fact their incomes rose due to inflation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2001 Congress opted to provide more tax cuts to those with incomes of over $1 million rather than fix a looming tax problem for the middle class. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 did include a small adjustment to the AMT, but it was not enough. And we knew then that the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT would continue to rise steadily because the combination of tax cuts and a minor adjustment to the AMT would cause the AMT to explode. We are rapidly approaching  this explosion and without immediate action America's middle class will be harmed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation extends and expands the AMT exemption amount for 2007 to prevent additional taxpayers from being impacted by the AMT. Without increasing and extending the AMT exemption for 2007, an additional 19.5 million taxpayers will be impacted by the AMT in 2007. Large families, with incomes as low as $49,438, will be hurt by the AMT. My legislation will allow nonrefundable personal credits such as the higher education tax credits and the dependent care credit against the AMT for 2007. This  legislation is offset by repealing the lower rates on capital gains and dividends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have argued that the extension of the capital gains and dividends benefits is necessary to provide investor certainty. But I believe that the certainty of working families worried about paying the AMT should come first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>About a third of long-term capital gains are reported by taxpayers who are impacted by the AMT and due to the interaction of the AMT, they do not fully benefit from the lower rates. Simply put, taxpayers forced to carry the AMT burden will not benefit from the lower capital gains and dividends rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The AMT is a looming problem that is impacting hard-working families and for each year that we fail to address the AMT, it gets worse and more expensive. At a minimum we must address the AMT for 2007. My legislation is not a long-term cure to the AMT crisis, but it will provide certainty for 2007 to hard working families who will be impacted by the AMT just because of where they live and the number of children they have, and it will addresses the AMT in a revenue neutral manner for 2007 as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all agree that the AMT should not be impacting families with incomes below $100,000. My bill fixes the AMT for 2007 in a timely and fiscally responsible manner and gives Congress time to work in a bipartisan manner to find a fiscally responsible permanent solution to the AMT.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="Introducing S. 103. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide that major oil and gas companies will not be eligible for the effective rate reductions enacted in 2004 for domestic manufacturers; to Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="103">S. 103</bill>] Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Restore a Rational Tax Rate on Petroleum Act of 2007. This legislation repeals the manufacturing deduction for big oil and gas companies that was enacted by Congress in 2004. I introduced this legislation in the 109th Congress and Congressman McDermott introduced companion legislation in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The domestic manufacturing deduction was designed to replace export-related tax benefits that were successfully challenged by the European Union. Producers of oil and gas did not benefit from this tax break. Initial legislation proposed to address the repeal of the export-related tax benefits and to replace them with a new domestic manufacturing deduction. That legislation only provided the deduction to industries that benefited from the export-related tax benefits. However, the final product  extended the deduction to include the oil and gas industry as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill repeals the manufacturing deduction for oil and gas companies because these industries suffered no detriment from the repeal of export-related tax benefits. At a time when oil companies are reporting mind-boggling record profits, there is no reason to reward them with a tax deduction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like me, many Members of Congress support a windfall profits tax on big oil and gas companies. Providing this deduction to oil and gas companies actually functions as a reverse windfall profits tax. This deduction lowers the tax rates on the windfall profits that they are currently enjoying. And without Congressional action this benefit will increase: upon enactment, the domestic manufacturing deduction was three percent, but it increased to six percent in 2007 and it is scheduled to increase  to nine percent in 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. We owe it to the American people to eliminate tax benefits to the oil industry at a time of record profits, record gas prices, and record deficits.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="106">S. 106</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to amend the Public Health Service Act for the establishment of a National Center for Social Work Research. Social workers provide a multitude of health care delivery services throughout America to our children, families, the elderly, and persons suffering from various forms of abuse and neglect. The purpose of this center is to support and disseminate information about basic and clinical social work research, and training, with  emphasis on service to underserved and rural populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the Federal Government provides funding for various social work research activities through the National Institutes of Health and other Federal agencies, there presently is no coordination or direction of these critical activities and no overall assessment of needs and opportunities for empirical knowledge development. The establishment of a Center for Social Work Research would result in improved behavioral and mental health care outcomes for our nation's children, families, the elderly,  and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to meet the increasing challenges of bringing cost-effective, research-based, quality health care to all Americans, we must recognize the important contributions of social work researchers to health care delivery and the central role that the Center for Social Work can provide in facilitating their work.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Providing students enrolled in graduate psychology programs with eligibility for financial assistance in the form of loans, loan guarantees, and scholarships will facilitate a much-needed infusion of behavioral science expertise into our community of public health providers. There is a growing recognition of the valuable contribution being made by psychologists toward solving some of our Nation's most distressing problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The participation of students from all backgrounds and clinical disciplines is vital to the success of health care training. The Title VII programs play a significant role in providing financial support for the recruitment of minorities, women, and individuals from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Minority therapists have an advantage in the provision of critical services to minority populations because often they can communicate with clients in their own language and cultural framework.  Minority therapists are more likely to work in community settings where ethnic minority and economically disadvantaged individuals are most likely to seek care. It is critical that continued support be provided for the training of individuals who provide health care services to underserved communities.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="108">S. 108</bill>] Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to amend Title VII of the Public Health Service Act to establish a psychology post-doctoral program. Psychologists have made a unique contribution in reaching out to the Nation's medically underserved populations. Expertise in behavioral science is useful in addressing grave concerns such as violence, addiction, mental illness, adolescent and child behavioral disorders, and family disruption. Establishment of a psychology post-doctoral  program could be an effective way to find solutions to these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similar programs supporting additional, specialized training in traditionally underserved settings have been successful in retaining participants to serve the same populations. For example, mental health professionals who have participated in these specialized federally funded programs have tended not only to meet their repayment obligations, but have continued to work in the public sector or with the underserved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While a doctorate in psychology provides broad-based knowledge and mastery in a wide variety of clinical skills, specialized post-doctoral fellowship programs help to develop particular diagnostic and treatment skills required to respond effectively to underserved populations. For example, what appears to be poor academic motivation in a child recently relocated from Southeast Asia might actually reflect a cultural value of reserve rather than a disinterest in academic learning. Specialized assessment  skills enable the clinician to initiate effective treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Domestic violence poses a significant public health problem and is not just a problem for the criminal justice system. Violence against women results in thousands of hospitalizations a year. Rates of child and spouse abuse in rural areas are particularly high, as are the rates of alcohol abuse and depression in adolescents. A post-doctoral fellowship program in the psychology of the rural populations could be of special benefit in addressing these problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the demonstrated success and effectiveness of specialized training programs, it is incumbent upon us to encourage participation in post-doctoral fellowships that respond to the needs of the nation's underserved.</paragraph>

Although the USMCI already exists as an informal collaborative effort, this bill will formally establish the institution  with a mission of providing for the maintenance of health in the military by enhancing cancer research and treatment, and studying the epidemiological causes of cancer among various ethnic groups.

This bill honors a legislator who left behind an enduring legacy of service to our veterans. The legislation also is an important step towards caring for our men and women who are currently fighting for us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am being joined today by Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE, the lead cosponsor of this bill. Senator Snowe has long been an advocate for veterans in her state, and I have been honored to work with her in the past on veterans issues. We have fought to reduce the backlog of disability claims at the Veterans Benefits Administration and to improve the military's ability to identify and treat Traumatic Brain Injury. Our introduction of the Lane Evans Bill is a continuation of these efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, more than 1.5 million American troops have been deployed overseas as part of the Global War on Terror. These brave men and women who protected us are beginning to return home. Six hundred thousand people who served in Iraq and Afghanistan are now veterans, and more than 185,000 have already received treatment at the VA. That number is increasing every day. Many of these fighting men and women are coming home with major injuries. As a country, we are only beginning to understand the true  costs of the Global War on Terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Government Accountability Office reported that VA has faced $3 billion in budget shortfalls since 2005 because it underestimated the costs of caring for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. The VA wasn't getting the information it needed from the Pentagon and was relying on outdated data and incorrect forecasting models. We cannot let these kind of bureaucratic blunders get in the way of the care and support we owe our servicemembers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To avoid these costly shortfalls in the future, we have to do a better job keeping track of veterans. That's why the first thing the Lane Evans Act does is to establish a system to track Global War on Terror veterans. The VA established a similar data system following the Persian Gulf War. That effort has been invaluable in budget planning as well as in monitoring emerging health trends and diseases linked to the Gulf War. The Gulf War Veterans Information System also has been important to medical  research and improved care for veterans. The sooner we begin keeping accurate track of our fighting men and women in Iraq, Afghanistan and beyond, the better and more efficiently we will be able to care for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Lane Evans Act also tackles Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Mental health patients account for about one-third of the new veterans seeking care at the VA. The VA's National Center for PTSD reports that "the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are the most sustained combat operations since the Vietnam War, and initial signs imply that these ongoing wars are likely to produce a new generation of veterans with chronic mental health problems."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill addresses PTSD in two ways. First, it extends the window during which new veterans can automatically get care for mental health from two years to five years. Right now, any servicemember discharged from the military has up to two years to walk into a VA facility and get care, no questions asked. After that, vets have to prove that they are disabled because of a service-connected injury, or they have to prove their income is below threshold levels. Unfortunately, it can take years  for symptoms of PTSD to manifest. The time it takes to prove service-connection for mental health illness is valuable time lost during which veterans are not receiving critically needed treatment. The Lane Evans Act allows veterans to walk into a VA facility any time five years after discharge and get assessed for mental health care. This both extends the window and shortens the wait for vets to get care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the legislation makes face-to-face physical and mental health screening mandatory 30 to 90 days after a soldier is deployed in a war zone. This will ensure that our fighting force is ready for battle, and that we can identify and treat those at risk for PTSD. By making the exams mandatory, we can help eliminate the stigma associated with mental health screening and treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another problem veterans face is that the VA and DoD do not effectively share medical and military records. Older veterans often have to wait years for their benefits as the Department of Defense recovers aging and lost paper records. Under the Lane Evans Act, the Department of Defense would provide each separating service member at the time of discharge with a secure full electronic copy of all military and medical records to help them apply for healthcare and benefits. DoD possesses the technology  to do this now. The information could be useful to VA to quickly and accurately document receipt of vaccinations or deployment to a war zone. The electronic data will also be helpful in future generations when family members of veterans seek information about military service, awards, and wartime deployment that go well beyond the existing single-sheet DD-214 discharge certificate, which is all veterans currently receive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the legislation improves the transition assistance that National Guardsmen and military reservists receive when they return from deployment. A 2005 GAO report found that because demobilization for guardsmen and reservists is accelerated, reserve units get abbreviated and perfunctory transition assistance including limited employment training. VA should provide equal briefings and transition services for all service members regarding VA healthcare, disability compensation, and other benefits,  regardless of their duty status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lane Evans dedicated his life to serving this country and serving veterans. The legislation Senator Snowe and I are introducing today, honors both the man and his mission, and will continue his legacy to the next generation of American veterans.</paragraph>

A bill to amend titles 10 and 38, United States Code, to improve benefits and services for members of the Armed Forces, veterans of the Global War on Terrorism, and other veterans, to require reports on the effects of the Global War on Terrorism, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of <bill type="s" number="3988">S. 3988</bill>, the Lane Evans Veterans Healthcare and Benefits Improvement Act of 2007. After serving with Lane Evans in the House of Representatives for over a decade, I am honored to help introduce legislation that serves as a fitting tribute to a man whose unfaltering efforts on behalf of our nation's veterans went unmatched.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also applaud Senator Obama for introducing this vital legislation at a time when over 600,000 courageous men and women have returned from combat in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In the past, Senator Obama and I have worked in a bipartisan manner to bolster the military's ability to detect and treat traumatic brain injury, and most recently, we have fought to reduce the backlog of claims at the Veterans Benefits Administration, VBA. Once again,  I  thank Senator Obama for his continuing resoluteness and advocacy for our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the beginning of conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, nearly 1.5 million brave Americans have deployed overseas to take part in the global war on terror. Of those 1.5 million Americans, at least 184,400 have already received medical treatment from the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA. It is time the VA and the Department of Defense, DOD, have the capability to provide incoming veterans with timely and efficient medical treatment and postdeployment services. For too long now, provision of  these critical services has been hampered by a lack of resources and policy restructuring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, the Government Accountability Office revealed that the VA faced a budget shortfall of $3 billion, due to the agency's inability to correctly gauge the benefits for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. As a result of spending shortfalls, the VA was forced to dip into contingency funds that could have compromised the funding for other vital veterans programs. In order to remedy these unacceptable deficiencies within the veterans' benefit system, this legislation will significantly enhance the  ability of the DOD and the VA to accurately track veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, by creating a data registry that will hold a comprehensive list of VA health care and benefits use. I remind my colleagues that a similar data system was established in 1998 for Gulf War I Veterans, and has been invaluable in assessing the necessary budgetary planning for our injured veterans from that conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, not all combat wounds are caused by bullets and shrapnel. Several studies have indicated that due to the nature of warfare in Iraq--with its intense urban fighting, terrorism and civilian combat--may cause a spike in the prevalence of post traumatic stress disorder, PTSD. According to the Veterans' Health Administration, as of October 2006, of the 184,524 Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans who have sought care from the VA, 29,041 have been diagnosed as having  probable symptoms of PTSD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly believe that we have a commitment to ensure that veterans with PTSD receive compassionate, world-class health care and appropriate disability compensation determinations. It is imperative that we do all we can to detect, diagnose, and treat our veterans suffering from PTSD as quickly as possible, in order to help our veterans and their families move beyond the psychological trauma of war and lead healthy, productive lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation's proposed data registry will further assist the VA with ongoing medical research into mental health, traumatic brain injury, and many other conditions. This legislation will also require the Department of Defense to conduct in-person physical and mental health exams with every service member 30 to 90 days after deployment to war zone, in order to ensure that potential cases of PTSD are identified and treated in a timely manner. By making the exams mandatory, the stigma associated  with mental health screening and treatment can be eliminated. Additionally, multiple deployments to combat zones may factor into a higher susceptibility to PTSD, stressing the necessity for mental screening prior to redeployment, in order to ensure that no servicemember</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation addresses the difficulties associated with PTSD symptoms that develop over prolonged periods of time. Currently, the window for new veterans to obtain health care at the VA is 2 years. However, in many circumstances, it takes years for PTSD symptoms and other problems related to mental health to emerge. Therefore, this legislation will extend the window for VA mental health care from 2 years to 5 years, ensuring the necessary mental health treatment for all veterans who are struggling  to recover from the traumas of war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, this legislation will take large steps towards improving the transfer of military and medical records in order for veterans to receive the health care and benefits they deserve. This bill requires DOD to provide each separating service member a full electronic copy of all military and medical records at the time of discharge. By facilitating the enhanced use of electronic records, veterans will be assured the proper access and management of their required care. Currently, a lack of swift  access to military records and medical records has hampered the VA's ability to treat veterans in need of care in a timely and effective manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a December 2006 GAO report, while verifying veterans claims of PTSD, regional VA offices are unable to directly access and search an electronic library of medical and service records for all service branches, and therefore, must rely on a DOD research organization, whose average response time to regional office requests is nearly 1 year. Clearly, such a processing delay is not only inexcusable, it is potentially harmful to the veteran and his or her family. Increased access to electronic  records will allow the VA to quickly identify the occurrence of stressful events or experiences that may lead to the necessary treatment for PTSD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this legislation will also require the VA to provide equal briefings and transition services for all service members regarding VA health care, disability compensation, and other benefits, regardless of status. Often times, guardsmen and reservists receive limited transition assistance and employment training, largely due to their accelerated demobilization. Thus, this legislation will provide equitable and fair transition services for all returning veterans, regardless of their service  branch, component or military status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have nothing but the utmost respect for those brave Americans who served in uniform with honor, courage, and distinction. The obligation our nation holds for its veterans is enormous, and it is an obligation that must be fulfilled every day. Since the attacks of September 11, millions of brave American men and women have answered our nation's call to service. Congress must now do everything in its power to answer our veterans' call, to ensure that they receive the medical care and treatment  that they rightly earned and rightly deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I am pleased to join Senator Obama in introducing <bill type="s" number="988">S. 988</bill>, because I believe it is crucial to the welfare of our Nation's veterans, and I urge my colleagues to voice their support.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="Introducing S. 118. A bill to give investigators and prosecutors the tools they need to combat public corruption; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="118">S. 118</bill>] Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Pryor to introduce the "Effective Corruption Prosecutions Act of 2007," a bill to strengthen the tools available to Federal prosecutors in combating public corruption. This bill gives investigators and prosecutors the statutory tools and the resources they need to ensure that serious and insidious public corruption is detected and punished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In November, voters sent a strong message that they were tired of the culture of corruption. From war profiteers and corrupt officials in Iraq to convicted Administration officials to influence-peddling lobbyists and, regrettably, even Members of Congress, too many supposed public servants were serving their own interests, rather than the public interest. The American people staged an intervention and made it clear that they would not stand for it any longer. They expect the Congress to take  action. We need to restore the people's trust by acting to clean up the people's government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate's new leadership is introducing important lobbying reform and ethics legislation. Similar legislation passed the Senate last year, but stalled in the House. This is a vital first step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the most serious corruption cannot be prevented only by changing our own rules. Bribery and extortion are committed by people bent on getting around the rules and banking that they won't get caught. These offenses are very difficult to detect and even harder to prove. Because they attack the core of our democracy, these offenses must  be found out and punished. Congress must send a signal that it will not tolerate this corruption by providing better  tools for federal prosecutors to combat it. This bill will do exactly that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the bill extends the statute of limitations for the most serious public corruption offenses. Specifically, it extends the statute of limitations from five years to eight years for bribery, deprivation of honest services, and extortion by a public official. This is an important step because public corruption cases are among the most difficult and time-consuming cases to investigate and prosecute. They often require use of informants and electronic monitoring, as well as review of extensive  financial and electronic records, techniques which take time to develop and implement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bank fraud, arson, and passport fraud, among other offenses, all have 10-year statutes of limitations. Since public corruption offenses are so important to our democracy and these cases are so difficult to investigate and prove, a more modest extended statute of limitations for these offenses is a reasonable step to help our corruption investigators and prosecutors do their jobs. Corrupt officials should not be able to get away with their ill gotten gains just by waiting out the investigators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also facilitates the investigation and prosecution of an important offense known as Federal program bribery, Title 18, United States Code, section 666. Federal program bribery is the key Federal statute for prosecuting bribery involving state and local officials, as well as officials of the many organizations that receive substantial Federal money. This bill would allow agents and prosecutors investigating this important offense to request authority to conduct wiretaps and to use Federal  program bribery as a basis for a racketeering charge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wiretaps, when appropriately requested and authorized, are an important method for agents and prosecutors to gain evidence of corrupt activities, which can otherwise be next to impossible to prove without an informant. The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute is also an important tool which helps prosecutors target organized crime and corruption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Agents and prosecutors may currently request authority to conduct wiretaps to investigate many serious offenses, including bribery of federal officials and even sports bribery, and may predicate RICO charges on these offenses, as well. It is only reasonable that these important tools also be available for investigating the similar and equally important offense of federal program bribery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, my bill authorizes $25 million in additional Federal funds over each of the next four years to give federal investigators and prosecutors needed resources to go after public corruption. Last month, FBI Director Mueller in written testimony to the Judiciary Committee called public corruption the FBI's top criminal investigative priority. However, a September 2005 Report by Department of Justice Inspector General Fine found that, from 2000 to 2004, there was an overall reduction in public  corruption matters handled by the FBI. The report also found declines in resources dedicated to investigating public corruption, in corruption cases initiated, and in cases forwarded to US Attorney's Offices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am heartened by Director Mueller's assertion that there has recently been an increase in the number of agents investigating public corruption cases and the number of cases investigated, but I remain concerned by the Inspector General's findings. I am concerned because the FBI in recent years has diverted resources away from criminal law priorities, including corruption, into counterterrorism. The FBI may need to divert further resources to cover the growing costs of Sentinel, their data  management system. The Department of Justice has similarly diverted resources, particularly from United States Attorney's Offices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additional funding is important to compensate for this diversion of resources and to ensure that corruption offenses are aggressively pursued. My bill will give the FBI, the United States Attorney's Offices, and the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice new resources to hire additional public corruption investigators and prosecutors. They can finally have the manpower they need to track down and make these difficult cases, and to root out the corruption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are serious about addressing the egregious misconduct that we have recently witnessed, Congress must enact meaningful legislation to give investigators and prosecutors the resources they need to enforce our public corruption laws. I strongly urge Congress to do more to restore the public's trust in their government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="Introducing S. 118. A bill to give investigators and prosecutors the tools they need to combat public corruption; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill that creates criminal penalties for war profiteers and cheats who would exploit taxpayer-funded efforts in Iraq and elsewhere around the world. Last year, despite the mounting evidence of widespread contractor fraud and abuse in Iraq, the Republican-controlled Senate would not act on it. Instead, the Congress took a terrible misstep in seeking to end the work of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. I have been proposing  versions of this bill  since 2003, when it did pass the Senate. Unfortunately, this crucial provision was stripped out of the final version of a bill by a Republican-controlled conference committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is growing evidence of widespread contractor fraud in Iraq, yet prosecuting criminal cases against these war profiteers is difficult under current law. We must crack down on this rampant fraud and abuse that squanders American taxpayers' dollars and jeopardizes the safety of our troops abroad. That is why I renew my efforts for accountability and action with the introduction of the War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007. I am pleased to join with Senators BINGAMAN, KERRY, HARKIN, ROCKEFELLER,  DORGAN, WYDEN, SCHUMER, CANTWELL, BILL NELSON, CLINTON, LAUTENBERG and MENENDEZ to introduce this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has sent billions upon billions of dollars to Iraq with too little accountability and too few financial controls. More than $50 billion of this money has gone to private contractors hired to guard bases, drive trucks, feed and shelter the troops and rebuild the country. This is more than the annual budget of the Department of Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of results from these companies, we are seeing penalties levied for allegations of fraud and abuse. At least 10 companies with billions of dollars in U.S. contracts for Iraq reconstruction have paid more than $300 million in penalties since 2000, to resolve allegations of bid rigging, fraud, delivery of faulty military parts and environmental damage. Seven other companies with Iraq reconstruction contracts have agreed to pay financial penalties without admitting wrongdoing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, Halliburton took in approximately $3.6 billion from contracts to serve U.S. troops and rebuild the oil industry in Iraq. Halliburton executives say that the company received about $1 billion a month for Iraq work in 2006. In addition, last month, we learned of new plans to spend hundreds of millions more to create jobs in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction found that millions of U.S. taxpayer funds appropriated for Iraq reconstruction have been lost and diverted. Yet we continue to send more taxpayer funds to Iraq, without accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too much of this money is unaccounted for, and many of the facilities and services that these funds were supposed to pay for are still nonexistent. We in Congress must ask--where did all the money go? We need to press for more accountability over the use and abuse of billions of taxpayers' dollars sent as development aid to Iraq, not less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A new law to combat war profiteering in Iraq and elsewhere is sorely needed and long overdue. Although there are anti-fraud laws to protect against the waste of U.S. tax dollars at home, no law expressly prohibits war profiteering or expressly confers jurisdiction on U.S. federal courts to hear fraud cases involving war profiteering committed overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill I introduced today would criminalize "war profiteering"--overcharging taxpayers in order to defraud and to profit excessively from a war, military action, or reconstruction efforts. It would also prohibit any fraud against the United States involving a contract for the provision of goods or services in connection with a war, military action, or for relief or reconstruction activities. This new crime would be a felony, subject to criminal penalties of up to 20 years in prison and fines  of up to $1 million, or twice the illegal gross profits of the crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also prohibits false statements connected with the provision of goods or services in connection with a war or reconstruction effort. This crime would also be a felony, subject to criminal penalties of up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million, or twice the illegal gross profits of the crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure also addresses weakness in the existing laws used to combat war profiteering, by providing clear authority for the Government to seek criminal penalties and to recover excessive profits for war profiteering overseas. These are strong and focused sanctions that are narrowly tailored to punish and deter fraud or excessive profiteering in contracts, both at home and abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The message sent by this bill is clear--any act to exploit the crisis situation in Iraq or elsewhere overseas for exorbitant gain is unacceptable, reprehensible, and criminal. Such deceit demeans and exploits the sacrifices that our military personnel are making in Iraq and Afghanistan, and around the world. This bill also builds on a strong legacy of historical efforts to stem war profiteering. Congress implemented excessive-profits taxes and contract renegotiation laws after both World Wars,  and again after the Korean War. Advocating exactly such an approach, President Roosevelt once declared it our duty to ensure that "a few do not gain from the sacrifices of the many."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Government cannot in good faith ask its people to sacrifice for reconstruction efforts that allow some to profit unfairly. When U.S. taxpayers have been called upon to bear the burden of reconstruction contracts--where contracts are awarded in a system that offers little competition and even less accountability--concerns about wartime profiteering are a grave matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Combating war profiteering is not a Democratic issue, or a Republican issue. Rather, it is a cause that all Americans can support. When I first introduced this bill in 2003, it came to be cosponsored by 21 Senators. The Senate Appropriations Committee also unanimously accepted these provisions during a Senate Appropriations Committee markup of the $87 billion appropriations bill for Iraq and Afghanistan for Fiscal Year 2004, and this provision passed the Senate. Passing bipartisan war profiteering  prevention legislation was the right thing to do then, and it is the right thing to do now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am hopeful that in a new year, and with a new Congress, we can make a fresh start and forge a bipartisan partnership on this important issue that will result in passage of this bill. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="Introducing S. 122. A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to extend benefits to service sector workers and firms, enhance certain trade adjustment assistance authorities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="122">S. 122</bill>] Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Trade Adjustment Assistance Improvement Act of 2007 with my good friend and colleague, Senator NORM COLEMAN.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, the United States passed, signed or concluded no fewer than five new free trade agreements. This June, the President's authority to negotiate trade agreements will expire. Congress should extend the President's authority to negotiate these deals. But when we do, we must raise the bar higher than before. Each deal must surpass the last, in order to take advantage of and adjust to changes in the global marketplace that affect American businesses and workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress will consider these agreements on their merits. In most cases, these deals will mean more access for American producers and service providers. In some few cases, these agreements could mean more and fiercer competition for producers and providers here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Competition is the engine that drives market economies like ours. It spawns innovation and creates new jobs. But just as jobs are created in new sectors of our economy, jobs are also lost in other sectors which experience sudden or unfair competition from abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether and how effectively we help those firms and workers who feel the negative effects of our national trade policy will, in large part, determine whether and how effectively we can move a trade agenda forward this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the last several Congresses, we have experienced unprecedented change in the global marketplace and in our labor market at home. I have worked to raise the bar on our efforts to help workers affected by these changes. Today, I propose again, more urgently than ever, that Congress and the administration work together to adapt our national worker adjustment strategies to the challenges of globalization. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Improvement Act is a first and necessary step in that  direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Trade Adjustment Assistance Improvement Act includes many proposals that Congress should consider before the program expires this September. The Act extends coverage to more of the workers who are affected by trade and globalization. And the Act will improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than a century, the manufacturing sector drove the American economy. So, when President Kennedy decided to open the American economy to more trade, he established the Trade Adjustment Assistance program to help workers in the manufacturing sector adjust to change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, our economy depends upon service exports. More than 75 percent of the American labor force work in services. While many service sector jobs cannot be outsourced, technology change makes it possible to provide many services remotely, in such fields as accounting, healthcare, and computers and information technology. So when a large call center left Kalispell, Montana, three years ago for Canada, the Montana workers left behind did not have access to the same benefits that workers laid off  from the Columbia Falls Aluminum manufacturing plant did. They should have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, the Department of Labor agreed, for the first time ever, that workers who produce software, an intangible product, should be eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance. That was a step in the right direction. We should take the next step this year. We should finally extend coverage to American service workers. That is what my bill proposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trade Adjustment Assistance certification takes place on a case-by-case, plant-by-plant basis. This means that while two factories producing the same products may both experience foreign competition that leads to layoffs, often only one of those factories' laid off workers gets certified as eligible for the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consider the softwood lumber industry. At least 12 out of 35 Trade Adjustment Assistance petitions filed by workers in Montana's softwood lumber industry over the last 7 years were denied by the Department of Labor. Yet, all of these mills were similarly affected by the same market conditions--dumped and subsidized Canadian imports. The International Trade Commission found that Canadian imports injured or threatened to injury the softwood lumber industry on a national scale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the Department of Labor's certification process does not take into account the bigger--and often more meaningful--picture. It simply relies on data provided by individual companies that lay off the workers to make its case-by-case determination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation that I introduce today makes industry-wide certification automatic for workers anywhere in the United States if the President, the International Trade Commission, or another qualified Federal agency determines that imports are harming that industry. My bill also authorizes, but does not require, the Secretary of Labor to make industry-wide determinations if she receives three or more petitions in one industry within one 6-month period, or if the Senate Finance Committee and the  House Ways and Means Committee pass a resolution requesting such an investigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can anticipate and in some cases even prevent displacements by renewing and expanding our commitment to small and medium-sized American companies looking to recapture their competitive edge. One key, yet small program that can help prevent displacements and shifts in production to overseas is the TAA for Firms program in the Department of Commerce. The Firms program reaches out to companies that have experienced decreasing sales or production due to import competition and have laid off or  expect to lay off workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program is chronically under-funded, and it should also be available to service sector firms. This bill would authorize $50 million for this program to reach more small- and medium-sized businesses across the nation before they are forced to lay off their American workers and close their doors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also moves the Firms program from the Economic Development Administration at Commerce back into the International Trade Administration. That's where it was previously. And frankly that's where it ought to have remained. Despite the Firms program's proven track record, proposals related to the program under the Economic Development Administration have sought to either defund the program altogether, or to limit eligibility by increasing the profit-loss margin required for participation  and arbitrary termination of firms after 2 years. The Firms program is a trade program and should be administered by an agency whose primary mission is to help American companies to adjust to and benefit from trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2002, with the passage of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act, I had great expectations for our first wage insurance demonstration project. In theory, wage insurance--or Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance--encourages swift re-entry into the workforce by replacing a portion of a worker's lost wages when a worker accepts a lower paying job within 6 months of a layoff. Workers who choose wage insurance over traditional Trade Adjustment Assistance training and income assistance often  have less access to good training or simply cannot afford to be out of work during their training. Wage insurance provides an incentive for employers to hire lower-skilled and older workers and train them on the job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In practice, I have been disappointed with the Department of Labor's implementation of the wage insurance proposal that we crafted in 2002. In a 2004 review by the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Labor's implementation of the benefit came up far short of the mark. Last  year, the Government Accountability Office once again found that the Department needed to improve its implementation, focusing specifically on its outreach to and direction  of state employment service offices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope to work with the Department of Labor on strategies that will improve its outreach. Wage insurance can help put people back to work, and can even save money  over traditional Trade Adjustment Assistance. But it cannot do either of those things if no one knows about the benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill streamlines the process to qualify for wage insurance, and lowers the eligible age from 50 to 40. Wage replacement should be available to younger workers who would re-enter the workforce more quickly if they could afford the often steep wage cut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another key component of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act was the health care tax credit to help displaced workers and some retirees maintain access to health insurance coverage. As health costs grow, losing health insurance can be as financially devastating to workers as losing a job. While I still believe that the TAA health care tax credit holds promise, this is clearly an area where reforms are needed to help the credit achieve its purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the TAA health care tax credit helps only a fraction of the hundreds of thousands eligible for assistance. In its first 2 years, less than 6 percent of eligible workers and retirees enrolled. A GAO report released last year studying five major plant closings in 2003 and 2004 found that only 3 to 12 percent of eligible workers enrolled. More than half of the workers studied didn't sign up for the tax credit because the 65 percent subsidy was too low to make health coverage affordable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tax credit also suffers from complexity and administrative red tape. More than half of eligible workers in GAO's recent study didn't even know about the benefit. About a third of workers who knew about the benefit decided not to enroll because it was too confusing. Even those who understand it have to navigate complex rules and requirements to get the benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to make this program simpler, more affordable, and more seamless so that more workers can take it up in the years ahead. We need to improve the information that workers and retirees get about the program and create systems to ensure that they get it. We need to cut down on the red tape. And we need to look at options to make this benefit more affordable so that we can truly reach the hundreds of thousands eligible for this benefit that Congress intended to help when we enacted these reforms  4 years ago. I plan to introduce a bill later in the year that will achieve these goals for reforming the health care tax credit and will look forward to working with Senator Coleman and other colleagues in this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The forces of globalization, like trade and technology change, have created tremendous opportunities for American businesses and workers, from cutting the cost of living to increasing the margin of profit. Trade accounts for a quarter of our gross domestic product. The adjustments we have made to maximize trade's benefits save the average American household $9,000 annually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we must also make adjustments to respond to the challenges that come with globalization. American businesses in the 21st century face rapidly-changing consumer preferences and ever-swifter technological advances. Global competition is fierce. Innovation is the key to these companies' continued prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The same holds true for American workers. They know that they must adjust to changes in the labor market if they are to maintain their place in it. Workers must be prepared for one or more career shifts before retirement. They must acquire more skills, and refresh their skills more often.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can help American companies adapt, and regain their competitive edge in the global marketplace. We can help more trade-displaced workers get back into the workforce. We should help these workers adapt not only to trade displacement, but to all the other aspects of globalization as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American workers and the companies that employ them must each continually adjust to a changing world marketplace. So too should our worker adjustment strategies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="Introducing S. 123. A bill to authorize the project for hurricane and storm damage reduction, Morganza to the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="123">S. 123</bill>] Mr. President, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita revealed the Gulf Coast's vulnerability to storms and flooding. With the help of generous Americans, the people of the gulf coast have been working hard over the last year and a half to rebuild their economy, their communities, and their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since these devastating storms struck in 2005, Congress directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to better protect America's gulf coast. Yet Congress's failure to pass a Water Resources Development Act WRDA, has delayed much of the needed protection. Of all of the many worthy projects throughout the Nation awaiting WRDA passage, there is one hurricane protection project that stands out and cries for immediate congressional authorization with or without a WRDA bill. Accordingly, I am introducing  legislation to singularly authorize this long overdue project known as "Morganza to the Gulf of Mexico Hurricane Protection."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This project includes a series of levees, locks and other systems through Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes in Louisiana. When complete, the Morganza to the Gulf project will protect about 120,000 people and 1,700 square miles of land against storm surges such as those caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Morganza to the Gulf project is distinguishable from all other projects awaiting WRDA passage because it was originally authorized in the last enacted WRDA bill in 2000, with the requirement that the Army Corps of Engineers deliver a favorable feasibility report by December 31 of that year. The Corps eventually submitted its report more than a year late, causing the authorization to expire despite the Corps' favorable recommendation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though repeated attempts have been made, Congress has been unable to deliver a new WRDA bill since 2000. As a result, vital hurricane protection for a portion of southeast Louisiana that the Corps recommends after years of environmental and economic analysis is awaiting congressional action, and an area of America's gulf coast remains needlessly vulnerable. Notably, every failed WRDA bill that the Senate, the House, and its committees have separately passed since 2000 has authorized the Morganza  to the Gulf Hurricane Protection project. Simply stated, there is no other item in WRDA that has been kicked down the road as many times as this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill that I introduce today fully authorizes the Morganza to the Gulf project in accordance with the plans and subject to the conditions of the Corps' report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ask unanimous consent that a copy of my statement and the bill appear in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="Introducing S. 124. A bill to provide certain counties with the ability to receive television broadcast signals of their choice; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="124">S. 124</bill>] Mr. President, another piece of legislation that I am introducing today addresses an issue important to citizens of southern Colorado.  The problem is this: cable and satellite subscribers in two southern Colorado counties are forced by current law to receive New Mexico television stations. Lately, I hear almost every day from my constituents that they would prefer to receive Colorado television over New Mexico television.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem stems from the fact that these two Colorado counties are located in the Albuquerque designated market area, as determined by Nielsen Media Research. As a matter of fairness, citizens of Colorado should be eligible to receive Colorado TV. Consumers should choose which television stations they receive, especially since they are the ones paying for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill I am introducing does just that. It makes a commonsense change to the law that allows citizens of La Plata and Montezuma Counties to receive television stations from Denver, not Albuquerque.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill that is nearly identical to laws enacted in previous Congresses that addressed similar problems in other States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="125">S. 125</bill>] Mr. President, I am introducing a bill dealing with the Granada Relocation Camp, also known as Camp Amache. It played an important, but sad, part in United States history. Camp Amache, one of 10 internment camps in the Nation, was established in August 1942 by the U.S. Government during World War II as a place to house the Japanese from the west coast and was closed on August 15, 1945. This is a significant part of American history and it should be preserved. My bill today will designate  the Granada Relocation Camp as a national historic site in Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="126">S. 126</bill>] Mr. President, another piece of legislation I am introducing today will authorize the expansion of the boundary of Mesa Verde National Park. The boundary adjustment will allow for the incorporation of 324 acres of land owned by the Henneman family, which is being purchased by the Conservation Fund for conveyance to the park, as well as a 38-acre parcel that will be donated to the park by the Mesa Verde Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mesa Verde National Park protects some of the best preserved and most notable archeological sites in the world. There are over 4,000 known archeological sites in the park, including 600 cliff dwellings. These sites were constructed by ancestral Puebloans, who occupied this area for over 700 years, from 600 A.D. to 1300 A.D.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="127">S. 127</bill>] Mr. President, the Baca National Wildlife Refuge Purpose bill will give the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service management tools that will allow the agency to run the Baca National Wildlife Refuge in a way that achieves the most beneficial use of this wonderful natural resource. The Baca National Wildlife Refuge consists of 92,500 acres of wetlands, sage brush, and riparian lands adjacent to the Great Sand Dunes National Park in southern Colorado. I, along with my former colleague from  Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, U.S. Representative Scott McInnis, sponsored the legislation that converted the Sand Dunes from a monument to a park. This legislation also authorized the Federal acquisition of the Baca Ranch lands and I remain actively interested in the area's management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="128">S. 128</bill>] Mr. President, I am introducing legislation which will extend congressional authorization for the Cache la Poudre Heritage Area in northern Colorado and will give local citizens greater management authority over the area. Under the original legislation, authored by former Colorado. Senator Hank Brown, the Secretary of Interior was to appoint a commission to work with the National Park Service and manage the area, but because of a technicality, the Secretary was unable to appoint the  commission. In response, local citizens stepped up and formed the Poudre Heritage Alliance to support the Heritage Area until an official commission could be named. This legislation would rectify this, and empower local residents to continue the work they have been doing on behalf of the heritage area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="129">S. 129</bill>] Mr. President, I am introducing a bill that will authorize the EPA to conduct a study of the growth in energy consumption by computer data centers operated by the Federal Government and by private corporations. The study will also examine industry movement toward energy efficient microchips and computer servers, potential cost savings associated with the movement to more efficient machines and what, if any, impacts to performance come with increased efficiency. The results of the  study will allow us to more fully understand the impact that the growing number of computers in use throughout the country has on energy consumption. This information will better position Congress to make recommendations to Federal agencies on their energy use and computer selection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will also provide private industry with information that will allow them to choose computer models that will decrease their energy consumption, making their companies more efficient and profitable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="130">S. 130</bill>] Mr. President, currently American seniors enjoy Medicare health plans called cost contracts. Under legislation I am introducing today, seniors will be able to continue utilizing these valued health plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Medicare cost contract plans are vital to America. Cost contracts provide Medicare beneficiaries in many rural areas and small cities throughout our country with an affordable, high-quality option to the traditional Medicare fee-for-service plan. For many of these beneficiaries, Medicare Advantage plans do not provide access to physicians in the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Medicare cost contracts are managed care plans that are reimbursed on a cost basis for providing health services. Under current law, cost contracts are one option for Medicare beneficiaries. Cost contract premiums cover Medicare deductibles and additional benefits not covered by basic Medicare. Further, for the costs of a normal Medicare fee-for-service copayment, seniors with cost contracts can use any</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Medicare provider regardless of whether they participate in the health plans network. This is critical in rural areas where physicians are scarce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cost contracts are vital to seniors who have them. From New York to Oregon, and even to Hawaii, America's seniors are enrolled in cost contract plans. Cost contracts are especially important in rural Colorado. Of the Coloradans with cost contract plans, 89 percent live in rural Colorado, where few physicians will see patients under straight Medicare or Medicare Advantage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many beneficiaries who are enrolled in Medicare cost contract plans live on limited incomes. Under the traditional Medicare program, beneficiaries incur considerable out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, Medicare supplemental insurers frequently age-adjust premiums  and either refuse coverage or impose coverage restrictions for pre-existing conditions. Medicare cost contract plans provide an affordable alternative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, under current law cost contracts soon will terminate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe Congress should work to extend Medicare cost contracts further. My bill, the Medicare Cost Contract Extension and Refinement Act of 2007, would accomplish this by extending by five years the cost contract sunset date of December 31, 2007, to December 31, 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cost contracts have been a bipartisan issue, with bipartisan support in the past. Senator Wyden of Oregon worked to get an extension for cost contracts in the 109th Congress, and I look forward to working with him again during the 110th.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="131">S. 131</bill>] Mr. President, I turn now to the issue of housing. Congress created the Mark-to-Market Program in 1997 to reduce Section 8 costs while preserving the affordability and availability of low-income rental housing. The purpose of the program is to reduce the property rents to market level while simultaneously restructuring property debt to prevent FHA defaults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Studies seem to show that the program has been an overwhelming success. Nearly 250,000 units of affordable housing have been preserved due to the Mark-to-Market Program. This is affordable housing that would have been permanently lost as affordable otherwise. According to HUD, the program has also saved taxpayers more than $2 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The original legislation authorized the Mark-to-Market Program for 4 years, which was subsequently extended for 5 additional years. Therefore, the Mark-to-Market program authority was scheduled to expire on September 30, 2006. Fortunately, the program authority was temporarily extended under the continuing resolutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the program was extended in 2001, it appeared that 5 additional years would be sufficient time for nearly all eligible properties to complete the Mark-to-Market process. However, more recent projections show that nearly 78,000 properties will face rent reductions over the next 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that even though the program will expire, these Section 8 properties with above market rates will still be required to have their rents reduced to market levels. Without the proper tools to also restructure the debt, many owners will lack sufficient funds for property maintenance or mortgage payments. Because many Section 8 properties are also FHA insured, this will result in a significant number of claims against FHA, in addition to many tenant displacements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, no one finds this a desirable scenario. Failure to extend the Mark-to-Market Program would be bad for tenants and bad for taxpayers. Thus, I am pleased to join with Senator REED of Rhode Island in reintroducing the Mark-to-Market Extension Act of 2007. Our bill would extend the program for 5 additional years to allow the remaining properties to go through the Mark-to-Market process. Frankly, I can see no downside to extending the program; It maintains affordable housing for less  money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to work with industry groups and with my colleagues to see that this very worthwhile program is extended for an additional 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="132">S. 132</bill>] Mr. President, the first bill I present today is to address one of the biggest current scourges of our citizens--methamphetamine abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just this week, a report published by Colorado's Meth Task Force cited Denver as a major distribution center for meth in the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation has been hard hit by the illegal trafficking of meth across U.S. borders. This is a national issue that is growing at a rate that constantly presents a challenge to our talented law enforcement officials. Through our work on the Combat Meth Act, we have provided them with many tools to fight the domestic production of meth. We are now called upon to respond to the issue of foreign produced meth as it presents a growing threat to the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In just 10 years, meth has become America's worst drug problem--worse than marijuana, cocaine or heroin. My home state of Colorado, like the rest of the Nation, faces challenges associated with the growing epidemic. Although the number of meth labs in the state is on the decline, meth distribution remains rampant because of Denver's location at the intersection of two major interstate highways, both of which serve as pipelines for the distribution of meth after it enters our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This evidence is echoed by the many local drug task forces, law enforcement officials, and District Attorneys who are tasked with tackling meth within our communities and who I have worked with on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to estimates from the DEA, an alarming 80 percent of the meth used in the United States comes from larger labs, increasingly abroad, while only 20 percent of the meth consumed in this country comes from small laboratories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, I propose that we improve efforts to curb the flow of meth both within and across our borders. We must take steps to expand enforcement to reduce the amount of meth being trafficked into the United States by establishing stricter penalties for meth offenders, improving coordination with foreign law enforcement officials, and examining the serious meth problems faced by Indian reservations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Methamphetamine Trafficking Enforcement Act of 2007 that I am introducing today is a first step to fighting the trafficking of this drug. My bill addresses the distribution issue by dramatically lowering the quantity and dollar amount thresholds for federal criminal prosecution of leaders of methamphetamine distribution rings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The trafficking of meth across our borders makes Federal action necessary, but this is not our war to fight alone. This bill also presses upon the United States Trade Representative, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security to include new ways to curb the illicit use and shipment of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and similar chemicals in multilateral and bilateral negotiations. Federal law enforcement officials will collaborate with their foreign counterparts  to fight meth internationally. Working together, we can find a long term solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the use, production and distribution of meth on Indian lands has increased in the past decade. With limited numbers of tribal law enforcement officials, meth can easily flow into and be trafficked out of many Indian reservations. This bill urges the Attorney General to research and report to Congress the challenges faced by all Indian reservations and make recommendations to help them address meth trafficking and abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must recognize the immediacy of the issue of methamphetamine trafficking. It is important that we protect the U.S. and its borders to ensure national security and the safety of our communities. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this issue and invite them to cosponsor the Methamphetamine Trafficking Enforcement Act of 2007.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400629" topic="Introducing S. 133. A bill to promote the national security and stability of the economy of the United States by reducing the dependence of the United States on oil through the use of alternative fuels and new technology, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="133">S. 133</bill>] Mr. President, in 2005, Congress enacted the Renewable Fuels Standard, RFS, as part of the Energy Policy Act. The RFS is a commitment by the United States government that, henceforth, ethanol must comprise a substantial part of the national vehicle fuel supply, with a goal of 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol in our gasoline by 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ethanol production has responded vigorously to this national policy. In fact, in only two years, ethanol production has boomed to where it now far exceeds the RFS target for this year. It is  widely anticipated that ethanol production will surpass the target for the year 2012 by the end of this year, five years early.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, it is time to increase the RFS targets. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the bill introduced today by my colleagues, Senator HARKIN and Senator LUGAR, that will increase those targets to 30 billion gallons by the year 2020 and 60 billion gallons by the year 2030. I hope my colleagues will support the provisions of that bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But for an expanded RFS to be successful, we must lay further groundwork. We cannot meet the targets and deadlines of an expanded RFS without a robust package of policies that set the stage for the next decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So far, we've met our biofuels goals by producing ethanol made from sugars that come from corn. This approach, by itself, has been profoundly successful in many rural communities but will eventually reach its maximum capacity. While that day is still several years away, we must begin preparations now. We must build upon our current path. We must continue our pursuit in cracking the code for corn cellulosics. We must pour the foundation for the next generation of biofuels made from the broadest  range of agriculture feedstocks. Our vocabulary must expand to cellulosics and biobut- anols, manure and miscanthus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Fuels Act, which I introduce today, breathes life into an expanded RFS. The American Fuels Act is the heart, the centerpiece, the key to ensuring that an expanded RFS is successful. That's why I am pleased to be joined today by my esteemed colleagues, Senator LUGAR and Senator HARKIN, in the introduction of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> The premise of the American Fuels Act is to create a "Biofuels Triangle" that focuses on (1). production, (2). distribution, and (3) consumption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To expand production, we create an "Alternative Diesel Standard" for diesels that complements the RFS for gasoline. The Alternative Diesel Standard requires 2 billion gallons of alternative diesels into the 40 billion gallon domestic diesel supply by the year 2016, encouraging greater use of biofuel feedstocks like vegetable oils, animal fats, coal-to-liquids, manure, and municipal waste. We call for the establishment of a cellulosic biomass fuels credit of an additional 76.5 cents per gallon  so that first-generation cellulosic plants can be built to meet the 250 million gallon production goals by 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To expand distribution, the American Fuels Act provides a tax credit for ethanol producers to invest in on-site blending equipment, bypassing oil refineries so that E-85 can be transported directly to the pump at your local gas station. Our bill also provides freedom for fuel franchisers by making it illegal for oil companies to stop their branded franchises from selling biofuels should these local businessmen wish to respond to their customer's request for biofuels. This bill also gives franchisers  the power to sue oil companies for imposing any restrictions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And to expand consumption, the American Fuels Act encourages the manufacture of more vehicles that can function on higher ethanol blends like E-85 so that more passenger cars to be flexible fuel vehicles. We provide a $100 tax credit to automakers for each ethanol-capable vehicle produced beyond the CAFE credit or any other government requirement. We require that 100 percent of the Federal fleet must be ethanol-capable or hybrids in the next 7 years. And we require that any public transit agency  that uses Federal dollars to upgrade bus fleets must purchase an alternative fuel bus, or pledge to use alternative fuels in those buses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To oversee these efforts, we create a Director of Energy Security in the Office of the President to ensure that our massive investment in domestically produced fuels get the national security leadership and coordination it requires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our dependence on oil is hurting our economy and jeopardizing our national security by keeping us tied to the world's most dangerous and unstable regimes. It's the fossil fuels we insist on burning--particularly oil--that are the single greatest cause of climate change and the damaging weather patterns that have been its result. Never has the failure to take on a single challenge so detrimentally affected nearly every aspect of our well-being as Nation. And never have the possible solutions had  the potential to do so much good for so many generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the American Fuels Act. I ask for their support, and for the swift enactment of this bill. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the American Fuels Act be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="Introducing S. 134. A bill to authorize the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit in the State of Colorado, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="134">S. 134</bill>] Mr. President, I am introducing the Arkansas Valley Conduit bill, which will ensure the construction of a pipeline that will provide the small, financially strapped towns and water agencies along the lower Arkansas River with safe, clean, affordable water. This project was originally authorized by Congress in 1962, over 40 years ago, as a part of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project. Due to several long years of drought and increasing Federal water quality standards, current water delivery  methods are not enough. By creating an 80-percent Federal, 20-percent local cost share formula to help offset the construction costs of the conduit, this legislation will protect the future of southeastern Colorado's drinking water supplies and prevent further economic hardship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="135">S. 135</bill>] Mr. President, another bill dealing with the large military presence in Colorado relates to the expansion of the Army's Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site. Due to an emphasis on rapid mobility, modularity, and maneuverability in recent years, the Army's ability to project force across the battlefield has increased exponentially. As such, the Army transformation is also driving higher their requirement for training space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With its close location to Fort Carson, Pinon Canyon was perfectly suited for the Army's training needs 20 years ago. However, with the arrival of 10,000 new soldiers to Fort Carson, the Army has determined that the size of the site needs to be increased in order to meet Fort Carson's new operational training requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been told repeatedly by Army officials that the genesis of Fort Carson's  expansion proposal occurred when several landowners approached Fort Carson and expressed their strong desire to sell. I also understand that sufficient numbers of willing sellers exist to support a significant expansion of the site. However, many in the community surrounding Pinon Canyon have major questions that need to be answered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to get some of these major questions answered, a reporting requirement was placed in the 2006 Defense Authorization bill, approved by both the Senate and the House. However, the Department of Army is restricted on communicating about any specific land acquisition proposal until a waiver for that site has been granted by the Secretary of Defense, which has yet to be granted. Thus, the Army's hands were tied and they were unable to meet the full reporting requirements in the 2006 Defense  authorization. I understand the difficult position the Army is on this issue, but I believe it is absolutely necessary that they provide the information to the community and to Congress prior to any acquisition of property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The leadership at Fort Carson has done a great job of reaching out and providing what information it could to the local communities. However, the Pentagon has not been as forthcoming. I believe the Congress and, more importantly, the local communities in Southeastern Colorado need more information before we can decide whether this proposed expansion is necessary and appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With these objectives in mind, today I am introducing a bill that clearly defines the process under which the Army can expand the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site. This legislation prohibits the use of eminent domain, requires the Army to pay fair market value. Most importantly, the bill does not allow the Army to proceed with land acquisition until it delivers the answers previously sought on the environmental and economic impacts of expansion and also must offer options for compensating the loss  of property tax revenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is vital that the Army take the time to answer these important questions to help alleviate the affected communities concerns. A number of counties and small towns in Southeastern Colorado could be adversely affected by this expansion, and this study will help us better understand the extent of these impacts and provide options for mitigating them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="136">S. 136</bill>] Mr. President, in another area, the events of the past several years remind us of the vital role of first responders in responding to natural disasters and terrorists attacks. It is important that our first responders receive the training needed to make critical, life-saving decisions under emergency circumstances. I believe that an essential element of preparing our first responders is to provide them with hands-on experience in real-world training environments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The importance of real world training was called to my attention by a visit to the Transportation Technology Training Center, TTC, in Pueblo, CO. There, I witnessed first hand the tools at our Nation's disposal to equip our first responders with the training they need, specifically in the context of rail and mass transit. But our national training consortium does not currently include a facility that is uniquely focused on emergency preparedness within the railroad and mass transit environment.  The inclusion of TTC would fill a critical gap in its current training agenda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TTC is a federally owned, 52-square-mile multimodal testing and training facility in Pueblo, CO, operated by the Association of American Railroads, AAR. Each year, an average of 1,700 first responders travel to Pueblo, CO, to participate in TTC's training program. The facility has trained more than 20,000 students in its 20-year history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ERTC is regarded as the "graduate school" of hazmat training because of its focus on hands on, true to life, training exercises on actual rail vehicles, including tank cars and passenger rail cars. The ERTC is uniquely positioned to teach emergency response for railway-related emergencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is for these reasons that today I introduce a bill authorizing the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium, as expanded to include the Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, CO, and providing for its coordination and use by the Department of Homeland Security in training the Nation's first responders.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="Introducing S. 146. A bill to require the Federal Government to purchase fuel efficient automobiles, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="146">S. 146</bill>] Mr. President, last year many Americans paid over $3--and in some places in California, $4--for a gallon of gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, oil companies made record profits. Enough is enough!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to help the American public and reduce our dependence on oil. The Federal Government should be taking the lead on this issue. Sadly, it is not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, the Federal Government purchased 64,000 passenger vehicles. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the average fuel economy of the new vehicles purchased for the fleet in 2005 was an abysmal 21.4 miles per gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, hybrid cars on the market can achieve over 50 miles per gallon and SUVs can obtain 36 miles per gallon. The Government's average of 21.4 miles to the gallon is too low.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, our government needs to purchase fuel-efficient cars, SUVs, and light trucks. This can be done today. I drive a Toyota Prius that gets over 50 mpg. The Ford Escape SUV can get 36 mpg.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government should be a leader in protecting our environment and national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am reintroducing the Government Fleet Fuel Economy Act. The bill requires the federal government to purchase vehicles that are fuel-efficient to the greatest extent possible.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="Introducing S. 148. A bill to establish the Paterson Great Falls National Park in the State of New Jersey, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="148">S. 148</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today with great pride to reintroduce legislation which would create a national park in my hometown of Paterson, NJ, The Paterson Great Falls National Park Act of 2007, which I first introduced last year, would bring long-deserved recognition and accessibility to one of our Nation's most beautiful and historic landmarks. I am pleased that my colleague from New Jersey, Senator MENENDEZ, is cosponsoring this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Great Falls are located where the Passaic River drops nearly 80 feet straight down, on its course towards New York Harbor. It is one of the tallest and most spectacular waterfalls on the east coast, but the incredible natural beauty of the falls should not overshadow its tremendous importance as the powerhouse of industry in New Jersey and the infant United States. Indeed, in 1778, Alexander Hamilton visited the Great Falls and immediately realized the potential of the falls for industrial  applications and development. Hamilton was instrumental in creating the planned community in Paterson--the first of its kind nationwide--centered on the Great Falls, and industry thrived on the power generated by the falls. Rogers Locomotive Works, the premier steam locomotive manufacturer of the 19th century, was  located in the shadow of the falls, as were many other vitally important manufacturing enterprises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford recognized the importance of the area by declaring the falls and its surroundings a "National Historic Landmark" in 1976; he called the falls "a symbol of the industrial might which helps to make the United States the most powerful nation in the world." Now, it is time that we recognize the importance of this historic area by making it New Jersey's first national park. This would be of special importance because so few of our national parks are in urban areas. I believe that  it is time we acknowledge that many of our most significant national treasures are located in densely populated areas, and creating a national park in Paterson is an ideal opportunity to do just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I grew up in Paterson, and I have appreciated the majesty and beauty of the Great Falls for many years. By creating a national park in Paterson, more Americans can be exposed to the exceptional cultural, natural, and historic significance of the Great Falls, and that is why I will passionately advocate for the passage of this bill. I have been delighted to again work with my good friend, Congressman BILL PASCRELL--another longtime resident of Paterson--on this issue, as well as with a  bipartisan group of lawmakers from my home State, all of whom believe strongly in this cause. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation, which is so important to New Jersey and all of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="Introducing S. 149. A bill to address the effect of the death of a defendant in Federal criminal proceedings; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="149">S. 149</bill>] Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator Sessions in re-introducing the "Preserving Crime Victims' Restitution Act." The Act would clarify the rule of law and procedures that should be applied when a criminal defendant, such as former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, dies after he has been duly convicted, but before his appeals are final.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill passed the Senate unanimously at the end of the 109th Congress, but unfortunately it was not taken up by the House. Except for minor, technical corrections, this new bill is the same as what the Senate passed in the last Congress, and I urge my colleagues to speedily pass this bill, as you did before, so that it can be enacted into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned when I introduced this bill last fall, we have worked closely with the Department of Justice in crafting this legislation, and have used much of DOJ's suggested language. DOJ fully supports the principles contained in this bill, and has indicated that it supports fixing this problem now to ensure that, despite a defendant's death, hard-won convictions are preserved so that restitution remains available for the victims of crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would establish that, if a defendant dies after being convicted of a federal offense, his conviction will not be vacated. Instead, the court will be directed to issue a statement that the defendant was convicted--either by a guilty plea or a verdict finding him guilty--but then died before his case or appeal was final.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would codify the current rule that no further punishments can be imposed on a person who is convicted if they die before a sentence is imposed or they have an opportunity to appeal their conviction. It would clarify that, unlike punishment, other relief (such as restitution to the victims) that could have been sought against a convicted defendant can continue to be pursued and collected after the defendant's death. It would establish a process to ensure that after a person dies, a representative  of his estate can challenge or appeal his conviction if they want, and can also secure a lawyer--either on their own or by having one appointed and, if the Government had filed a criminal forfeiture action--in which it had sought to reach the defendant's assets that were linked to his crimes--the Government would get an extra 2 years after the defendant's death to file a civil forfeiture lawsuit so that it could try to recover those same assets in a different, and traditionally-accepted manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The need for this legislation was vividly demonstrated on October 17, 2006, when U.S. District Judge Sim Lake, of the Southern District of Texas, wiped clean the criminal record of Enron founder Kenneth Lay, even after a jury and judge had unanimously found him guilty of 10 criminal charges, including securities fraud, wire fraud involving false and misleading statements, bank fraud and conspiracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The decision to dismiss Mr. Lay's conviction was not based on any error in the trial, suggestion of unfairness in the proceedings, or allegation of his innocence. Instead, it was simply based on the fact that Mr. Lay died before his conviction had been affirmed on appeal, under a common law rule known as "abatement."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, the order essentially meant that Mr. Lay was "convicted but not guilty"--"innocent by reason of his death."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Lake granted this dismissal even in the face of DOJ Enron Task Force filings, which noted how Mr. Lay's conviction "provided the basis for the likely disgorgement of fraud proceeds totaling tens of millions of dollars." In other words, the dismissal meant that millions of dollars that the jury found was obtained by Mr. Lay illegally at the expense of former Enron employees and shareholders, would remain untouched in the Lay estate. These employees and shareholders will now find it much  harder to lay claim to these ill-gotten gains held by Mr. Lay's estate, because they will be unable to point to his criminal conviction as proof of his wrongdoing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not fault Judge Lake for issuing this order. He made it clear that he was simply following the binding precedent issued in 2004 by the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, in a case called United States v. Estate of Parsons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as I noted in a letter I wrote to Attorney General Gonzales on October 20, 2006, the Fifth Circuit's Parsons decision goes far beyond the traditional rule of law in this area. While the common-law doctrine of abatement has historically wiped out "punishments" following a criminal defendant's death, the Supreme Court has never held that it must also wipe out a victim's right to other forms of relief such as restitution, which simply compensate third parties who were injured by criminal misconduct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the six dissenters in Parsons noted, the majority's " `finality rationale' is a completely novel judicial creation which has not been embraced or even suggested by ..... other courts." The Third and Fourth Circuits, for example, have expressly refused to take this position, and upheld a restitution order after a criminal defendant's death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Parsons decision was remarkable in several other respects, including the fact that (as the dissenters noted), its new rule of law was apparently inspired by a single law review article. That academic piece boldly claimed that a criminal defendant's right of appeal is "evolving into a constitutional right,"  and suggested that a conviction untested by appellate review is unreliable and illegitimate. This notion runs contrary to the traditional rule  applied in virtually every other context--where a jury's findings are typically respected under the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course a defendant is presumed innocent at the outset of his case. After a jury has deliberated and unanimously issued a formal finding of guilt, however, that presumption of innocence no longer stands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Parsons "finality" rationale even raises the possibility that a defendant who fully admitted his wrongdoing and pleaded guilty, but who then died while an appeal of his sentence was pending, could have his entire criminal conviction erased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, that has already occurred, in the 1994 case of United States v. Pogue, where the D.C. Circuit ordered the dismissal of a conviction of a defendant whose appeal was pending--even though the docketing statement had said that the defendant intended to challenge only his sentence, and not his underlying conviction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following Judge Lake's decision, I sent a letter to the Attorney General, asking him to appeal the order and continue the fight for Enron victims. Unfortunately, the Justice Department decided in November to withdraw its appeal, leaving it up to the victims themselves to pursue any further relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very disappointed in this decision. These victims have had their livelihoods and retirement stripped from them, and they deserved a Justice Department that was willing to fight vigorously to protect their interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Enron's collapse in 2001 wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value, and more than $2 billion in pension plans. When America's seventh largest company crumbled into bankruptcy after its accounting tricks could no longer hide its billions in debt, countless former Enron employees and shareholders lost their entire life savings after investing in Enron's 401(k) plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of these Enron victims have been following closely the years of preparation by the Enron Task Force, and the four-month jury trial and separate one-week bench trial, hoping to finally recover some restitution in this criminal case. And despite Mr. Lay's vigorous efforts to avoid being held accountable for his actions, a conviction was finally secured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet now these people have essentially been victimized again. They will be forced to start all over in their efforts to get back some portion of the pension funds on which they expected to subsist, and the other hard-earned assets that will remain beyond their reach, despite the unanimous, hard-fought verdicts finding Mr. Lay guilty of all ten counts with which he had been charged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe in situations like this, leaving the victims without this recourse is an unacceptable outcome. That is why I am introducing this bill to prevent further injustices like this from ever happening again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I have no desire for our Government to punish a criminal defendant who dies, the calculation should be different when we are determining how to make up for harm suffered by other innocent victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation offers a fair solution and orderly process in the event that a criminal defendant dies prior to his final appeal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time has come for Congress to end this injustice--hopefully, by acting quickly enough to assist these Enron victims, but in any event in a way that will solve the problems that the Lay dismissal so starkly illustrated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues in the Senate to quickly pass this bill, as you did in the 109th Congress, so that we can enact it into law in the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="Introducing S. 150. A bill to amend the safe Drinking Water Act to protect the health of pregnant women, fetuses, infants, and children by requiring a health advisory and drinking water standard for perchlorate; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="150">S. 150</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would order EPA to promptly establish a health advisory and then a drinking water standard for perchlorate. I am pleased that the Senior Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and the Senior Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, have joined as original cosponsors of this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will require the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a standard for perchlorate contamination in drinking water supplies by December 31, 2007. EPA still has not committed to establishing a tap water standard for this widespread contaminant, decades after learning that perchlorate is a problem in our drinking water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perchlorate is a clear and present danger to California's and much of America's health. We cannot wait any longer to address this threat. EPA needs to get moving and protect our drinking water now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Drinking water sources for more than 20 million Americans are contaminated with perchlorate. Perchlorate is the main ingredient in rocket fuel, which accounts for 90 percent of its use. Perchlorate is also used for ammunition, fireworks, highway safety flares, air bags, and fertilizers. It dissolves readily in many liquids, including water, and moves easily and quickly through the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perchlorate was first discovered in drinking water in 1957, and at the latest in the mid-1980s, EPA was aware that perchlorate contaminates drinking water. Since 1997, when California developed a new, more sensitive testing method that can detect perchlorate down to 4 parts per billion, perchlorate has been found in soil, groundwater, and surface water throughout the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a May 2005 report from the Government Accountability Office, perchlorate contamination has been detected in water and soil at almost 400 sites in the U.S., with levels ranging from 4 parts per billion to millions of parts per billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>GAO also said that limited EPA data show that perchlorate has polluted 35 States and the District of Columbia, and is known to have contaminated 153 public water systems in 26 States. Those data likely underestimate total exposure, as illustrated by the finding  of the California Department of Health Services that perchlorate contamination has affected at least 276 drinking water wells sources and 77 drinking water systems in California alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Food and Drug Administration and other scientific researchers have detected perchlorate in the United States food supply, including in lettuce, milk, cucumbers, tomatoes, carrots, cantaloupe, wheat, and spinach, and in human breast milk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perchlorate can harm human health, especially in pregnant women and children, by interfering with thyroid gland, which is needed to produce important hormones that help control human health and development. The thyroid helps to ensure children's proper mental and physical development, in addition to helping to control metabolism. Thyroid problems in expectant mothers or infants can affect babies, and result in delayed development and decreased learning capability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The largest and most comprehensive study to date on the effects of low levels of perchlorate exposure in women was recently published by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC found that there were significant changes in thyroid hormones in women with low iodine levels who were exposed to perchlorate. The CDC researchers also found that even small increases in low-level perchlorate exposure may affect the thyroid's production of hormones in iodine deficient  women. About 36 percent of women in the U.S. have iodine levels equal to or below those of the women in the study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>EPA has not established a health advisory or national primary drinking water regulation for perchlorate. Instead, the agency has established a "Drinking Water Equivalent Level" (DWEL) of 24.5 parts per billion for this toxin. The agency's DWEL does not take into consideration all routes of exposure to perchlorate, and has been criticized by experts for failing to sufficiently consider the body weight, unique exposure, and vulnerabilities of certain pregnant women and fetuses, infants, and children.  It is based primarily upon a small human study by Greer et al., which tested a small number of adults. The DWEL also does not take into account the new much larger studies from CDC, and other data indicating potential effects at lower perchlorate levels than previously found.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alarming levels of perchlorate have been discovered in Lake Mead and the Colorado River, the drinking water source for millions of Southern Californians. Communities in the Inland Empire, San Gabriel Valley, Santa Clara Valley, and the Sacramento area are also grappling with perchlorate contamination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill will ensure that EPA acts swiftly to address this threat to our health and welfare. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important piece of legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="Introducing S. 152. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to establish a program to help States expand the educational system to include at least 1 year of early education preceding the year a child enters kindergarten; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="152">S. 152</bill>] Mr. President, today I rise to reintroduce the Early Education Act. This bill will enable children across our nation to be prepared with the initial skills and abilities to successfully begin their education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly believe that there should be a national commitment to establish that all children have access to high quality prekindergarten programs. This bill is a step forward in making that possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of the nearly 8 million and 3- and 4-year-olds that could be in early education, fewer than half are enrolled in an early education program. In my State of California alone, just 65 percent of 4-year-olds are in preschool.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The result is that too many children come to school ill-prepared to learn. They lack language and social skills. Almost all experts now agree that an early education experience is one of the most effective strategies for improving later school performance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Researchers have discovered that children have a learning capacity that can and should be developed at a much earlier age than was previously thought. The National Research Council reported that prekindergarten educational opportunities are critical in developing early language and literacy skills and preventing reading difficulties in young children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, studies have shown that children who participate in prekindergarten programs are less likely to be held back a grade, show greater learning retention and initiative, have better social skills, are more enthusiastic about school, and are more likely to have good attendance records.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, prekindergarten programs pay for themselves in long-term benefits. It is estimated that for every dollar invested in early education, about $7 are saved in later costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill, the Early Education Act, would create a program in at least 10 States to provide one year of prekindergarten early education in the public schools. There is a 50 percent matching requilement, and the $300 million authorized annually under this bill would be used by States to supplement--not supplant--other Federal, State or local funds. This bill would serve approximately 136,000 children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our children need a solid foundation that builds on current education system by providing them with early learning skills. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="153">S. 153</bill>] Mr. President, I introduce the Healthy Firefighters Act, an important bill that would protect the firefighters who respond to emergencies. The bill is inspired by the brave firefighters from the San Jacinto Ranger District, who responded to the Esperanza Incident wildfire in southern California in October of 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We rely on firefighters to protect us when disaster strikes, and they selflessly place themselves in danger to provide that protection. One danger they face in the course of performing their duties is exposure to toxins--including fine particulates, carbon monoxide, sulfur, formaldehyde, mercury, heavy metals, and benzene--that can have a significant negative effect on their health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We owe it to this country's brave firefighters to minimize their sacrifice for our safety, to the greatest extent possible. My bill would require the U.S. Fire Administrator to contract with a medical research university to conduct long-term medical health monitoring of firefighters who responded to emergencies in any areas declared a disaster by the Federal Government, and provide healthcare for those firefighters who suffer health problems as a consequence of their work in those disaster areas.  Pulmonary illness, neurological damage, and cardiovascular damage are examples of illnesses for which firefighters would be monitored and treated under this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to consider and pass this bill to benefit firefighters, who are among this country's most heroic citizens.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300014" topic="Introducing S. 154. A bill to promote coal-to-liquid fuel activities; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="154">S. 154</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coal-to-Liquid Fuel Promotion Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long, America has ignored its energy security. Many of us can remember the energy crises of the 1970s. We were held ransom by a monopolistic oil cartel and forced to endure shortages, gas lines, and high prices. In the early 1980s, just as America began to invest in alternative fuels, the oil-producing states of the world crashed prices to make new technology uncompetitive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During most of the last 25 years, we have enjoyed low prices and plentiful supply, but we have paid a price. Today, we find America is addicted to oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since September 11, we have seen the fragile state of our energy markets. Domestic disasters and terrorism can send energy prices spiraling out of control. Our energy resources are stretched to the limits, and small supply disruptions ripple through the entire economy. America needs a secure domestic source to ease our dependency on imported oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why today I am reintroducing my bill, the Coal-to-Liquid Fuel Promotion Act with the current Presiding Officer, Senator Obama of Illinois. I have worked with the coal and fuel industries, the Department of Defense, and environmental groups to identify the needs of the coal-to-liquid industry and the best way for the Government to support the coal-to-liquid development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coal has long been America's most abundant fuel resource and has driven our economic growth since the industrial revolution. In the coal-to-liquid process, coal is gasified, the gas is run through the FischerTropsch process, and the resulting fuel is refined into jet fuel and diesel fuel. The final product is cleaner than conventional fuels because nearly all of the sulfur and nitrogen is removed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this technology is just taking root in America, South Africa meets 30 percent of its fuel needs with coal. CTL technology lets America capitalize on a domestic resource that will fuel economic growth and produce the energy security required in today's world. Many of my colleagues may ask one question right now: If this technology is so great and could replace expensive imports from the Middle East, why hasn't it been done already? The answer is simple: costs and market uncertainty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A typical size CTL plant costs more than $2 billion to construct. With complicated plans and environmental permits, a new plant could take 5 to 8 years to build. This is a challenge for even the biggest risk-takers on Wall Street. Raising the capital needed to develop a new technology is always difficult, but the multibillion dollar investment scale of a CTL plant has made it nearly impossible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On top of this is the uncertainty of the price of oil. America has seen oil prices rise dramatically in the last few years. But investors are concerned that oil prices could drop to the low levels of the 1980s and make CTL plants uncompetitive again. I believe oil prices will stay above the price range that keeps CTL profitable, which is estimated to be between $40 and $50 per barrel. But even if oil prices were to drop that low in the next few decades, I believe CTL would more than pay for itself  by insulating us from supply shocks and providing a secure domestic fuel</paragraph>
    <paragraph>supply for the military, businesses such as airlines and trucking, and the average American's car.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government must act to help industry overcome these hurdles. This legislation will provide a combination of incentives to create a network of coal-to-liquid production in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Coal-to-Liquid Fuel Promotion Act of 2007 has three parts. First, this bill addresses the need to pull together the investors and the billions of dollars required to build a CTL plant. It expands and enhances the Department of Energy's loan guarantee program included in the Energy Policy Act we passed in 2005. It expressly authorizes  DOE to administer loan guarantees for the Nation's first CTL plants. These plants must be large scale, which is a minimum  production of 10,000 barrels a day of liquid fuel. This program is only for the first 10 commercial plants. By then, we should have proven the economics of this technology and no further incentives will be needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also provides a new program of matching loans. The loans are capped at $20 million and must be matched dollar-for-dollar by non-Federal money. They must be repaid as soon as the plants are financed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, this legislation would fundamentally alter the economics of CTL plants during and after construction. It expands the investment tax credits and expensing provisions enacted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. It increases the 20-percent tax credit for CTL plants to a maximum of $200 million for each of the first 10 CTL plants. It also extends the expiring exploration of the fuel excise tax credits for CTL from 2009 to 2020. The current provisions will expire long before the first CTL plant  is even operational. This extension will provide a meaningful timeframe for CTL plants to benefit from the same tax incentives we offer renewable and hydrogen fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also provides an incentive for CTL plants to capture carbon emissions. We can use CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 to produce oil in depleted wells or extract coalbed methane. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, this bill provides the Department of Defense the funding to purchase, test, and integrate CTL fuels into the military. In the last few months, the Air Force has successfully tested CTL fuels in B-52 bombers. These tests are proving to the DOD and to industry that CTL fuels are as safe and reliable as the fuels produced today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also instructs the DOD to conduct a study on CTL fuel storage and its inclusion in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It authorizes the construction of storage facilities for CTL fuel and allows the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to hold up to 20 percent of its stock in the form of CTL-finished fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By combining the abilities of the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense with incentives in the Tax Code, I am confident this legislation will help Kentucky, and America, become the world leaders in coal-to-liquid fuel promotion. This coal-to-liquid fuel legislation made headlines during the summer of 2006 when gas prices were at a near record high. Yet when prices fell, the pressure to pass this legislation also decreased. We have been very lucky that a mild winter has held down  demand. We will not always be this lucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No matter what energy prices are, America needs a domestic source of fuel. This year alone we will send $250 billion to foreign countries, mostly in the Middle East, just to buy oil. Imagine what we could have done here at home with trillions of dollars we have spent on oil in the last few decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no room for politics in energy security. In the 110th Congress, Senator OBAMA and I will work hard with all of our colleagues to pass this important legislation. I especially look forward to working with my new chairman in the Energy Committee, Senator BINGAMAN, and my ranking member, Senator DOMENICI, on this important bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now send to the desk the Coal-to-Liquid Fuel Promotion Act of 2007 and the related Coal-to-Liquid Fuel Energy Act of 2007. I ask unanimous consent these two bills be printed with my remarks in the RECORD.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President,  today I am reintroducing in this new Congress a bill to advance a cause for which I have been fighting for over 10 years now. The Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act would extend the current Internet tax moratorium, so that the Internet can remain free from burdensome and discriminatory taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Legislation to keep the Internet free from these taxes has passed the Senate 3 times since 1998 with sunsets that required consecutive extensions. A permanent moratorium on Internet taxation passed through both the Commerce and Finance Committees in the 109th Congress yet failed to get action on the Senate floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come to the Floor again, bringing up Internet Taxation, because the moratorium on Internet Taxation is set to expire on November 1st of this year. In only 11 months, if Congress does not act, the moratorium on Internet Taxation that has allowed the Internet and e-commerce to flourish will cease to protect American consumers and American businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't want those who use the Internet to end up like our ancestors: they were told the Spanish-American War telephone tax was "temporary," and that the tax was just needed to pay for the war. That war ended two centuries ago, and Congress is just now getting around to getting rid of the tax!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The last time I checked, the Internet shows no sign of riding off into the sunset, or becoming obsolete. You can bet that once discriminatory taxes are slapped on Internet users, those discriminatory taxes won't be going away any time soon either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you want to figure out how much discriminatory taxes could be, just look at your phone bill. Taxes and government fees already add as much as 20 percent in surcharges to consumer's telephone bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you take a gallon of milk to the checkout counter and pay tax on the purchase, the clerk can't turn around and charge you another tax if you're going to use the milk in your cereal and another tax if you're going to put milk in your coffee. But that's what will happen to the Internet if the ban is not made permanent. You'd still pay all the telephone taxes and all the franchise fees on cable, but on top of those you'd pay even more taxes for the same service when you sign on to the Internet!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Discriminatory and double taxation of the Internet has been banned for 8 years now. In all that time no one has ever come forward with evidence to show that the failure to impose discriminatory taxes has hurt them. No one has demonstrated why taxes that cannot be imposed in the offline world should be imposed on identical online transactions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Western Civilization may not end if the Permanent Internet Freedom Act is not passed, but you have to ask how many times Congress has to revisit, re-litigate and re-approve a law that has been this effective. It is time to make the Internet Tax moratorium permanent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleagues, Mr. MCCAIN from Arizona and Mr. SUNUNU from New Hampshire for introducing this legislation with me today. They both fought tirelessly alongside me and our former colleague, Mr. Allen from Virginia, to get the moratorium extended in 2004. I am pleased that they are now replacing Mr. Allen as my bi-partisan partners on this important piece of legislation. It is my hope that the three of us, working with the rest of our colleagues, can get this all-important  piece of legislation passed early this year so we do not have to worry about it as the November 1st deadline fast approaches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300071" topic="Introducing S. 155. A bill to promote coal-to-liquid fuel activities; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators WYDEN and SUNUNU in introducing the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act of 2007. This bill would ensure that consumers never have to pay a toll when they access the Information Highway. Whether consumers log onto the Internet using cable modem, DSL, dial-up or wireless services, under this bill, they will not be taxed by any State or local governments for their Internet usage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Keeping Internet access affordable to all Americans is a worthy policy goal. The Internet has become a fixture and core component of modem American life that has created and continues to generate social and economic opportunities throughout the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1998, Congress put in place a temporary ban on any State or local taxes on Internet access. Additionally, Congress placed a moratorium on multiple or discriminatory State and local taxes on e-commerce transactions to ensure the growth of online commerce. This moratorium was extended in 2004, but is set to expire November 1, 2007. Our legislation, the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act of 2007, would make the moratorium permanent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the U.S. ranks 12th in the world in per capita Internet access, lagging behind competitors South Korea, the United Kingdom and Canada. This is absolutely unacceptable for a country that leads the world in technical innovation, economic development, and international competitiveness. We certainly cannot afford to make Internet access more difficult to obtain if we want to become more internationally competitive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is little doubt that the development and growth of the Internet was aided by the tax moratorium. In 1998, the year the moratorium was first enacted, 36 percent of U.S. adults reported using the Internet. In 2006, that number grew to 73 percent, an all time high according to an April 2006 Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project Report. However, the report also found that Americans in the lowest income households are considerably less likely to be online. Just 55 percent of adults living in  households with less than $30,000 annual income go online, versus 73 percent of those whose income is between $30,000-$50,000. This "digital divide" needs to be closed immediately. Continuing Congress's policy of reducing the cost of Internet access, by preventing the service from being taxed, is one step we can take now to close the "digital divide."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As use of the Internet has grown, so has e-commerce. According to the most recent comScore Networks report, Americans spent over $100 billion on Internet purchases during 2006, a major milestone for retailers and the World Wide Web. This legislation would ensure that online transactions are not taxed by cities or States at a rate higher than other sales transactions. Again, the goal of this legislation is to make the Internet affordable to all  Americans  and foster the growth of the Internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to the question of whether it is wise to make Internet access tax free, Congress has a long history of giving tax incentives to commercial activities that we believe help our society. The Internet is a technology that is a source of and vehicle for significant economic benefits. The proponents of this legislation strongly believe the Internet clearly merits the tax incentives provided by this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize that there are some who wish to continue to make the Internet tax moratorium temporary. Their premise is that the Internet will continue to evolve and thus Internet access may develop into a service the States and localities would wish to tax. I believe that this moratorium should be permanent to continue encouraging those very Internet-related innovations. By making the moratorium permanent, businesses that invest in and provide Internet access will be able to operate in a predictable  tax environment. This will result in continued investment in this very important social, political and economic medium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress now has the opportunity to extend permanently the Internet tax moratorium and assure consumers that taxes will not inhibit the offering of affordable Internet access. By supporting this legislation, we can continue to promote Internet usage by Americans as well as encourage innovation relating to this technology. For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to support this pro-consumer, pro-innovation, and pro-technology bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300025" topic="Introducing S. 158. A bill to expand access to affordable health care and to strengthen the health care safety net and make health care services more available in rural and underserved areas; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="158">S. 158</bill>] Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from Louisiana, Senator LANDRIEU, in introducing the Access to Affordable Health Care Act, a comprehensive plan that builds on the strengths of our current public programs and private health care system to make affordable health care available to millions more Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of my priorities in the Senate has been to expand access to affordable health care. There are still far too many Americans without health insurance or with woefully inadequate coverage. As many as 46 million Americans are uninsured, and millions more are underinsured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maine is in the midst of a growing health insurance crisis, with insurance premiums rising at alarming rates. Whether I am talking to a self-employed fisherman, a displaced worker, the owner of a struggling small business, or the human resource manager of a large company, the soaring costs of health insurance is a common concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These cost increases have been particularly burdensome for small businesses, the backbone of the Maine economy. Maine small business owners want to provide coverage for their employees, but they are caught in a cost squeeze. They know that if they pass on premium increases to their employees, more of them will decline coverage. Yet these small businesses simply cannot afford to absorb double-digit increases in their health insurance premiums year after year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem of rising costs is even more acute for individuals and families who must purchase health insurance on their own. Monthly health insurance premiums in Maine often exceed a family's mortgage payment. Clearly, we must do more to make health insurance more available and affordable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Access to Affordable Health Care Act, which we are introducing today, is a seven-point plan that combines a variety of public and private approaches. The legislation's seven goals are: one, to expand access to affordable health care for small businesses; two, to make health insurance more affordable for individuals and families purchasing coverage on their own; three, to strengthen the health care safety net for those without coverage; four, to expand access to care in rural and underserved  areas; five, to increase access to affordable long-term care; six to promote healthier lifestyles; and seven, to provide more equitable Medicare payments to Maine providers to reduce the Medicare shortfall, which has forced hospitals, physicians and other providers to shift costs onto other payers in the form of higher charges, which in turn drives up health care premiums.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me discuss each of these seven points in greater detail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, our legislation will help small employers cope with rising health care costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since most Americans get their health insurance through the workplace, it is a common assumption that people without health insurance are unemployed. The fact is, however, that as many as 83 percent of Americans who do not have health insurance are in a family with a worker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Uninsured working Americans are most often employees of small businesses. In fact, some 63 per cent of uninsured workers are employed by small firms. Smaller firms generally face higher costs for health insurance than larger firms, which makes them less likely to offer coverage. The Access to Affordable Health Care Act will help these employers cope with rising costs by creating new tax credits for small businesses to make health insurance more affordable. It will encourage those small businesses  that do not offer health insurance to do so and will help employers that do offer insurance to continue coverage for their employees even in the face of rising costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation will also provide grants to provide start-up funding to States to help businesses to form group purchasing cooperatives. These cooperatives will enable small businesses to band together to purchase health insurance jointly. This will help to reduce their costs and improve the quality of their employee's health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation would also authorize a Small Business Administration grant program for States, local governments and non-profit organizations to provide information about the benefits of health insurance to small employers, including tax benefits, increased productivity of employees, and decreased turnover. These grants would also be used to make employers aware of their current incentives under State and Federal laws. While costs are clearly a problem, many small employers are simply not aware  of laws that have already been enacted by both States and the Federal government to make health insurance more affordable. For example, in one survey, 57 percent of small employers did not know that they could deduct 100 percent of their health insurance premiums as a business expense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation would also create a new program to encourage innovation by awarding demonstration grants in up to 10 States conducting innovative coverage expansions, such as alternative group purchasing or pooling arrangements, individual or small group market reforms, or subsidies to employers or individuals purchasing coverage. The States have long been laboratories for reform, and they should be encouraged in the development of innovative programs that can serve as models for the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Access to Affordable Health Care Act will also expand access to affordable health care for individuals and families. One of the first bills that I sponsored when I came to the Senate was legislation to establish the State Child Health Insurance Program, which provides insurance for the children of low-income parents who cannot afford health insurance, yet make too much money to qualify for Medicaid. Since 1997, this program, which is known as SCHIP, has contributed to a one-third decline  in the uninsured rate of low-income children. Today, over six million children--including approximately 14,500 in Maine--receive health care coverage through this remarkably effective health care program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, our legislation will shore up the looming shortfalls in SCHIP funding that 17 states--including Maine--will face in Fiscal Year 2007 to ensure that children currently enrolled in the program do not lose their coverage. Just prior to adjournment in December, the Congress approved legislation to partially address these shortfalls. That legislation, however, provides only about one-fifth of the funds needed. Our legislation will close that gap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation also builds on the success of the SCHIP program and gives States a number of new tools to increase participation. The bill authorizes new grants for States and non-  profit organizations to conduct innovative outreach and enrollment efforts to ensure that all eligible children are covered. States would also have the option of covering the parents of the children who are enrolled in programs like MaineCare. States could also use funds provided  through this program to help eligible working families pay their share of an employer-based health insurance plan. In short, the legislation will help ensure that the entire family receives the health care they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, to help make health coverage more affordable for low and middle-income individuals and families who do not have employer-provided coverage and who are not eligible for the expanded programs, our legislation would provide an advanceable, refundable tax credit of up to $1,000 for individuals earning up to $30,000 and up to $3,000 for families earning up to $60,000. This could provide coverage for up to six million Americans who would otherwise be uninsured for one or more months, and  will help many more working lower-income families who currently purchase private health insurance with little or no government help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To strengthen our nation's health care safety net, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act calls for a doubling of funding over five years for the Consolidated Health Centers program, which includes community, migrant, public housing and homeless health centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These centers, which operate in underserved urban and rural communities, provide critical primary care services to millions of Americans, regardless of their ability to pay. About 20 percent of the patients treated in Maine's community health centers have no insurance coverage and many more have inadequate coverage, so these centers are a critical part of our nation's health care safety net.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem of access to affordable health care services is not limited to the uninsured, but is also shared by many Americans living in rural and underserved areas where there is a shortage of health care providers. The Access to Affordable Health Care Act therefore calls for increased funding for the National Health Service Corps, which supports doctors, dentists, and other clinicians who serve in rural and inner city areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation will also give the program greater flexibility by allowing National Health Service Corps participants to fulfill their commitment on a part-time basis. Current law requires all National Health Service Corps participants to serve full-time. Many rural communities, however, simply do not have enough volume to support a full-time health care practitioner. Moreover, some sites may not need a particular type of provider on a full-time basis. Our bill therefore gives the program additional  flexibility to meet community needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Senate co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer's Disease, I am particularly sensitive to the long-term care needs of patients with chronic diseases like Alzheimer's and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Long-term care is the major catastrophic health care expense faced by older Americans today, and these costs will only increase with the aging of the baby boomers. Most Americans mistakenly believe that Medicare or their private health insurance policies will cover the costs of long-term care should they develop a chronic illness or cognitive impairment like Alzheimer's Disease. Unfortunately, far too many do not discover that they do not have coverage until they are confronted with the difficult  decision of placing a much-loved parent or spouse in long-term care and facing the shocking realization that they will have to cover the costs themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Access to Affordable Health Care Act will provide a tax credit for long-term care expenses of up to $3,000 to provide some help to those families struggling to provide long-term care to a loved one. It will also encourage more Americans to plan for their future long-term care needs by providing a tax deduction to help them purchase long-term care insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Health insurance alone is not going to ensure good health. As noted author and physician Dr. Michael Crichton has observed, "the future of medicine lies not in treating illness, but preventing it." Many of our most serious health problems are directly related to unhealthy behaviors--smoking, lack of regular exercise, and poor diet. These three major risk factors alone have made Maine the state with the fourth highest death rate due to four largely preventable diseases: cardiovascular disease,  cancer, chronic lung disease and diabetes. These four chronic diseases are responsible for 70 percent of the health care problems in Maine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill therefore contains a number of provisions designed to promote healthy lifestyles. An ever-expanding body of evidence  shows that investments in health promotion and prevention offer returns not only in reduced health care bills, but in longer life and increased productivity. The legislation will provide grants to States to assist small businesses wishing to establish "worksite wellness" programs for their employees. It would also authorize a grant program to support new and existing "community partnerships," such as the Healthy Community Coalition in Maine's Franklin County, to promote healthy lifestyles  among hospitals, employers, schools and community organizations. And, it would provide funds for States to establish or expand comprehensive school health education, including, for example, physical education programs that promote lifelong physical activity, healthy food service selections, and programs that promote a healthy and safe school environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act would promote greater equity in Medicare payments and help to ensure that the Medicare system rewards rather than punishes states like Maine that deliver high-quality, cost-effective Medicare services to our elderly and disabled citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 and subsequent legislation did take some significant steps toward promoting greater fairness by increasing Medicare payments to rural hospitals and by modifying geographic adjustment factors that discriminated against physicians and other providers in rural areas. The legislation we are introducing today will build on those improvements by establishing State pilot programs that reward providers of high- quality, cost-efficient Medicare services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Access to Affordable Health Care Act outlines a blueprint for reform based on principles upon which I believe a bipartisan majority in Congress could agree. The plan takes significant strides toward the goal of universal health care coverage by bringing millions more Americans into the insurance system and by strengthening the health care safety net.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="Introducing S. 158. A bill to expand access to affordable health care and to strengthen the health care safety net and make health care services more available in rural and underserved areas; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from Main, Senator COLLINS, in introducing the Access to Affordable Health Care Act. The latest available Census figures show that 46.6 million people in our country--including almost 19 percent of the people in my home State of Louisiana--are without health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This statistic has been referred to so often in the media and in this body that it is almost possible to hear it without realizing the full impact of such uncertainty on one's day-to-day life. 46.6 million people without health insurance means 36.3 million families struggling with the knowledge that they may be just one hospitalization away from bankruptcy. It means 8.3 million children who may not be able to access the care they need to prevent increasingly common and often debilitating chronic  illnesses such as diabetes and asthma, adversely affecting them for the rest of their lives. It means 27.3 million Americans with jobs, who work everyday knowing that they still may not be able to provide for their families in their time of need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Across the country, small business owners and families are struggling with the high cost of health care. This is particularly true in Louisiana and across the gulf coast, where recovery from the 2005 hurricanes has already placed heavy burdens on thousands of families trying to rebuild and businesses working to reopen. Since 2000, the number of employees nationwide receiving health insurance through their employers has actually decreased, reversing the progress we saw in the 1990s. Small businesses  create two out of every three new jobs in America and account for nearly half of America's overall employment. Yet only 26 percent of businesses with fewer than 50 employees can offer health insurance  to their employees. The Access to Affordable Health Care Act gives the small businesses that are the backbone of this country the opportunity to help make their employees' lives just a little easier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation further provides for the expansion of the enormously successful SCHIP program, allowing States to cover increased numbers of pregnant women and poor, working adults. It allows for more community health centers and encourages health care providers to practice in the increasingly underserved rural areas of all States. It gives businesses the tools to not only insure their employees against illness but to encourage wellness, decreasing health care costs for everybody. It allows  our government to reward States that find ways to improve health outcomes among Medicare patients, actively supporting the types of cost-efficient successes that improve the quality of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A country identified by its ingenuity and creativity has a moral responsibility to do more than we have to provide its citizens with the ability to keep their families safe and healthy. These comprehensive, real steps forward will open new doors of opportunity and access to affordable health care for millions of American families and business owners, and I am proud to have partnered with Senator COLLINS in this important pursuit. I encourage my colleagues to consider this legislation and  to help provide our all our constituents with the peace of mind.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="Introducing S. 163. A bill to improve the disaster loan program at the Small Business Administration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="163">S. 163</bill>] Mr. President, 16 months after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, small business owners in New Orleans and across Louisiana are still struggling to keep their doors open and their employees working. In those 16 months, I have worked with Senators Snowe, Landrieu, and Vitter to produce a comprehensive package to reform the SBA's Disaster Assistance program. The SBA's failed response in a time of unmatched need demonstrated to everyone that this program  is broken and needs fixing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Immediately after Hurricane Katrina hit, I introduced an amendment with Senator Landrieu to the fiscal year 2006 Commerce, Justice and Science appropriations bill to address the needs of Gulf Region small business and homeowners. The amendment was adapted with input from Chair Snowe, and a subsequent bipartisan amendment passed the Senate with a vote of 96-0. Although the entire Senate supported the amendment, it was stripped out of the bill in conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 30, 2005, I again worked with Chair Snowe and Senators Landrieu and Vitter to introduce a bipartisan proposal, the Small Business Hurricane Relief and Reconstruction Act of 2006 <bill type="s" number="1807">S. 1807</bill>. This proposal was opposed by the administration. In June, I introduced the Small Business Disaster Loan Reauthorization and Improvements Act of 2006, <bill type="s" number="3487">S. 3487</bill> which once again attempted to comprehensively address the shortcomings of the SBA's Disaster Assistance program.  Again, the administration opposed this effort. In August, the Small Business Committee unanimously reported <bill type="s" number="3778">S. 3778</bill>, the Small Business Reauthorization and Improvements Act of 2006, which again put forward a bipartisan, comprehensive fix for this program. Finally, in December, just prior to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, on the first day of this new Congress, I am introducing the Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2007. Once again, this bill enjoys bipartisan support by the chair and the ranking minority member of the Small Business Committee, as well as by the Democratic and Republican Senators of Louisiana, whose constituents continue to wait for their Government to respond appropriately. I am introducing this bill on the first day of the 110th Congress because as the incoming  chair of the Small Business Committee, improving the Disaster Assistance program at the SBA is among my top priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill includes directives for the SBA to create a private disaster loan program, to allow for lenders to issue disaster loans. To ensure that these loans are borrower-friendly, we provide authorization for appropriations so that the agency can subsidize the interest rates. In addition, the administrator is authorized to enter into agreements with private contractors in order to expedite loan application processing for direct disaster loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also includes language directing SBA to create an expedited disaster assistance loan program to provide businesses with short-term loans so that they may keep their doors open until they receive alternative forms of assistance. The days immediately following a disaster are crucial for business owners--statistics show that once they close their doors, they likely will not open them again. These short-term loans should help prevent those doors from closing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A presidential declaration of Catastrophic National Disaster will allow the administrator to offer economic injury disaster loans to adversely affected business owners beyond the geographic reach of the disaster area. In the event of a large-scale disaster, businesses located far from the physical reach of the disaster can be affected by the magnitude of a localized destruction. We saw this when the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 affected businesses from coast to coast, and we saw it  again with the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes. Should another catastrophic disaster strike, the President should have the authority to provide businesses across the country with access to the same low-interest economic injury loans available to businesses within the declared disaster area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Non-profit entities working to provide services to victims should be rewarded and given access to the capital they require to continue their services. To this end, the administrator is authorized to make disaster loans to non-profit entities, including religious organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Construction and rebuilding contracts being awarded are likely to be larger than the current $2 million threshold currently applied to the SBA Surety Bond Program, which helps small construction firms gain access to contracts. This bill increases the guarantee against loss for small business contracts up to $5 million and allows the administrator to increase that level to $10 million, if deemed necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also provides for Small Business Development Centers to offer business counseling in disaster areas, and to travel beyond traditional geographic boundaries to provide services during declared disasters. To encourage Small Business Development Centers located in disaster areas to keep their doors open, the maximum grant amount of $100,000 is waived.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that Congress may remain better aware of the status of the administration's disaster loan program, this bill directs the administration to report to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship of the Senate and to the Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives regularly on the fiscal status of the disaster loan program as well as the need for supplemental funding. The adiministration is also directed to report on the number of Federal contracts awarded to small businesses,  minority-owned small businesses, women-owned businesses, and local businesses during a disaster declaration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, gas prices continue to fluctuate, and fuel-dependent small businesses are struggling with the cost of energy. This bill provides relief to small business owners during times of above average energy price increases, authorizing energy disaster loans through the Small Business Administration and the United States Department of Agriculture to companies that are dependent on fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 16 months since Katrina struck, I have visited New Orleans three times. I have met with the lifeblood of that city--its small business owners--the shopowners on Bourbon Street and on Magazine Street who make that city unique. The people of New Orleans are resilient, and they remain hopeful; they are keeping their  businesses open despite tourism that has been slow to return and despite a government response that was painfully slow to arrive. Sixteen  months is too long a time to wait to reform and improve a program that could have breathed relief into this city's economy during a time of desperation. As this new Congress begins, I call on my colleagues to support this legislation, a bipartisan labor of more than a year's worth of negotiations. The tools offered within this bill will go a long way toward heading off another Katrina-like response to any future catastrophic disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="Introducing S. 164. A bill to modernize the education system of the United States; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="164">S. 164</bill>] Mr. President, few things are more indispensable to the United States than good schools. Today more than ever, a quality education is the gateway to achieving the American dream and the best guarantee of equal opportunity for all our people, good citizenship, and an economy capable of mastering modern global challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1965, as part of the War on Poverty, President Johnson signed into law the landmark Elementary and Secondary Education to strengthen America by allocating substantial Federal resources to public schools for the first time. In the bipartisan No Child Left Behind Act of 2002, we reauthorized this landmark legislation, and for the first time made a commitment that every child--black or white, Latino or Asian, native-born or an English language learner, disabled or non-disabled--would be part  of an accountability plan that holds schools responsible for the progress of all students. It required every State to implement content and performance standards specifying what children should know and be able to do, and urged States to create high-quality assessments so that students' progress toward</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know these reforms can work. But good results are not possible without adequate investments. The No Child Left Behind Act recognized that to move forward with these dramatic changes, schools would need a continued infusion of Federal resources, because the cost was obviously too great for States and local governments to bear alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, because of budget cuts and poor implementation, we still have much to do to ensure that no child is left behind. President Bush has short-changed the promise made in the law by nearly $56 billion, leaving millions of children without the resources needed to reduce class sizes, improve teaching, and set higher standards for our schools. Now, more than ever, it's important to deliver the resources our schools deserve. Thousands of schools are on watchlists in their States and need Federal  support and extra assistance to bridge the learning gaps of their students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The No Child Left Behind Act is again scheduled for reauthorization this year, and we must work to ensure that its promise is fulfilled. Aside from additional funding, one of our priorities must be to ensure that the standards and assessments used to measure progress are fair and reliable. Accountability is only as good as the tests to measure progress, and many States use tests that need substantial improvement. Some use exams that are not aligned to the standards that students must meet. Others  have manufactured artificially high test score gains by lowering standards and adjusting test scores in order to avoid unfavorable consequences under the law's accountability framework.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to shift our understanding of the Act away from the idea that it labels and penalizes schools, and toward a more productive framework that helps schools and States reach higher, not lower. We should use the well-regarded National Assessment of Educational Progress the "Nation's report card" as a benchmark for the rigor of State exams. States should also align their elementary and secondary school standards with their standards for college entrance and success, creating seamless systems  that guide students from the beginning of their education to the achievement of a college degree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SUCCESS Act I am introducing today would assist States in these efforts. As the name suggests, it would provide Federal support for States Using Collaboration and Cooperation to Enhance Standards for Students. It would help ensure that public schools challenge all students to learn to high standards and provide needed help to schools with the greatest needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation updates the Nation's report card the National Assessment of Educational Progress to ensure that it sets a national benchmark which is internationally competitive and is aligned with the demands of the 21st century global economy. It expands our ability to monitor science achievement. It requires the NAEP to measure student preparedness to enter college, the 21st century workforce, or the Armed Services. It also requires the Secretary of Education to examine the gaps in student  performance on state-level assessments and NAEP assessments, and to assist States that wish to analyze how their standards and assessments compare to the benchmark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SUCCESS Act provides critical resources to States to create "P-16" Preparedness Councils that will engage members of the early childhood, K-12 and higher education communities, along with the business and military communities, and other stakeholders to align the standards with what is needed for success in college and the workforce. The councils would be charged with ensuring that State  standards and assessments meet international benchmarks to  improve instruction and student achievement and prepare students to contribute in the global economy. It also provides funds to encourage collaboration among States in raising the bar for student achievement by providing grants to States working together to establish common standards and assessments that are rigorous, internationally competitive, and aligned with postsecondary demands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleagues on this and other important proposals as we move toward the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act. In the coming weeks, our Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions will hold a series of hearings and roundtable discussions to hear from experts and those dealing with the challenges of the current law on a daily basis. Our goal is to work on a bipartisan basis with all our colleagues in the Senate and in the House and with the Administration  to develop a strong bipartisan bill that builds on the positive aspects of the law, addresses the concerns about its implementation, and encourages reforms that we know will work to help students succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Teachers deserve the resources they need to help students achieve at higher levels. In many schools, the most valuable resource that teachers require is time. Yet the U.S. ranks 11th among industrialized nations in the number of days children attend school. Innovative approaches are needed to extend the school day and year in high-need schools. We should recruit Americorps volunteers to coordinate academically oriented extended-day programs for students and assist teachers during the school day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must also ensure that students in high poverty schools have access to good teachers. We should create incentives to attract the best teachers to the neediest schools, including increased salaries for teachers and principals with strong track records of success who work in hard-to-staff schools, and by creating "career advancement systems" in which highly effective teachers serve as instructional leaders for new or less successful teachers. To help teachers improve their teaching, we should  invest more in training them to use the best data to improve instruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should also help parents by replicating Boston's successful initiative to place parent-family outreach coordinators in every high-poverty school, and offer grants to school districts to support community programs that address children's social, emotional and other non-academic needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must invest in these and other reforms to give schools the resources they need to close the achievement gap and ensure that all students can stay on track to graduate and succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Experience shows that each year yields greater success when policymakers and educators commit in the long term to higher standards, better teacher training, stronger accountability, and extra help for students in need. The initial implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act has been flawed, but we can't abandon its vision of an America in which every child is important and deserves to be educated and enjoy the full benefits of our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That vision is as enduring as America itself. As John Adams wrote in the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780, the education of the people is "necessary for the preservation of their rights and liberty." More than two hundred years later, we need to recapture that spirit, and make "No Child Left Behind" a reality, not merely a slogan.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300071" topic="Introducing S. 166. A bill to restrict any State from imposing a new discriminatory tax on cell phone services; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="166">S. 166</bill>] Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator DeMint  in introducing the Cell Phone Tax Moratorium Act of 2007. This bill would put a stop to new discriminatory taxes on cell phone services for a period of 3 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The average general sales tax in the U.S. today is around six percent, but the average State and local taxes and fees on cell phone service comes in at about 17 percent. Consumers are left paying a hefty portion of their monthly cell phone bill to the Government for what many believe is their most important communications device.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Conference of State Legislatures and the National Governors' Association have issued policy positions calling for states to eliminate excessive and discriminatory taxes on communications services. State and local governments have been working with the telecommunications industry to find a solution to these excessive taxes, but no agreement has been reached. During the three year moratorium, it is my hope that State and local governments--in cooperation with industry--will work to  eliminate discriminatory taxes and fees on wireless services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Excessive taxes dampen innovation, and are regressive, hitting the most vulnerable customers the hardest. Although more then 72 percent of all Americans own a cell phone, 26 percent said they could not live without it because it is their only communications source, according to a recent Pew Internet and Life Project report. Cell phone only owners are often those who find it difficult to afford a wired and a wireless phone. Additionally, according to the same report, 74 percent of the Americans  say they have used their cell phone in an emergency and gained valuable assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some State and local governments cannot move beyond the idea that wireless services are some kind of luxury item that can be taxed at a higher rate. These services may have been a luxury item many years ago, but due to deregulation wireless services are more affordable than ever and even necessary for personal or business reasons. This is why it is perplexing that some states burden cell phone subscribers with taxes and fees that can be as high as 24 percent of a consumer's total bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tax rates as high as this are generally associated with cigarettes and alcohol and known as "sin taxes" designed to reduce consumption. I cannot imagine it is the intention of states and localities to reduce consumption of wireless services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mindful of the revenue requirements of States and localities, this bill does not eliminate existing discriminatory taxes. Nor does the bill prohibit states and localities from imposing new taxes on wireless services that are not discriminatory. The bill simply puts a stop to the creation of new discriminatory taxes on cell phone services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year I introduced similar legislative language during a mark-up in the Senate Commerce Committee. The amendment passed with a vote 21-1. I am hopeful that this bill will once again be supported by the Commerce Committee and that it will be approved by the full Senate. I ask my colleagues to join me in ending the discriminatory sales taxes on this very popular communications service.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="Introducing S. 167. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to require the Secretary of Energy to provide grants to eligible entities to carry out research, development, and demonstration projects of cellulosic ethanol and construct infrastructure that enables retail gas stations to dispense cellulosic ethanol for vehicle fuel to reduce the consumption of petroleum-based fuel; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="167">S. 167</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Cellulosic Ethanol Development and Implementation Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> As a Nation, we should be striving for greater energy independence and for more environmentally friendly sources of fuel for our automobiles. Cellulosic ethanol is fuel ethanol made from glucose, a sugar derived from the cellolose in biomass. It is chemically identical to ethanol made from food crops like corn and sugar cane. Cellulosic ethanol is more difficult to make, because cellulose is a tough structural material that gives plants their strength.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, making ethanol from cellulose lets us tap into a much larger source of sugars, and, therefore, potentially make much larger amounts of fuel ethanol, tens of billions of gallons or more. An additional benefit is that cellulosic ethanol made from biomass is likely to produce smaller amounts of greenhouse gases than corn ethanol, and far less greenhouse gases than gasoline it will replace. With continued technology improvements, it should be cheaper than gasoline. Because it is locally  made, it reduces the need for oil imports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An April 2005 study by the Department of Energy and Agriculture indicates that the country currently has a supply of biomass sufficient to displace 30 percent of the country's present petroleum use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am introducing this bill because I believe we should be doing more to harness our Nation's cellulosic ethanol potential. I have been a strong proponent of using alternative transportation fuels and efficiency measures to reduce oil dependence. Last Congress, we took a good first step in the development of cellulosic ethanol. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, known as EPAct 05, requires that at least one-third of the Nation's ethanol be produced from cellulose by 2013.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, EPAct 05 also created a new ethanol section of the Clean Air Act (Section 212). In that section, one subsection, section 212(e), includes language I authored to establish a new cellulosic production conversion assistance grant program. That program, housed at the Department of Energy, provides financial assistance to encourage the building of new cellulosic facilities in the U.S. The program was authorized to receive $250 million in fiscal year 2006 and $400 million in fiscal year  2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though Congress has taken the steps I've just described, I believe we can and should do more, and the bill I introduce today does just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would add two new cellulosic ethanol programs to the Clean Air Act. The first is a new competitive grant program for cellulosic motor vehicle fuel research and demonstration projects. Funded at $1 billion over 6 years, universities, Federal and State research labs, private industry, nonprofit groups, or partnerships between any of these groups, would be able to compete for funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill would also create a new pilot program for the installation of ethanol fuel pumps at gas stations or any other needed infrastructure required to dispense ethanol fuel, such as a storage tank, for example. Funded at $1 billion over 6 years, the same entities that would participate in the research section of the bill would also be able to compete for funds under this program. Successful applicants would have to provide 20 percent of the grant in matching funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, my bill also extends the authorization for the original cellulosic grant program that is currently authorized in EPAct 05. The authorization expires at the end of this year, and the bill I introduce today would extend it at $400 million per year thru 2010. This extension will ensure the program continues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I believe that our Nation's energy policy must focus on conservation, improvements in energy efficiency, and the development of clean, renewable energy technology. I continue to support measures to accomplish these goals, including the promotion of cellulosic ethanol. I believe this bill is an important next step in achieving these objectives. I ask content that a copy of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="Introducing S. 168. A bill to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a national cemetery for veterans in the Pikes Peak Region of Colorado; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="168">S. 168</bill>] Mr. President, I am reintroducing legislation to establish a National Veteran's Cemetery in the Pikes Peak Region of Colorado in order to meet the needs of veterans in southern Colorado. This legislation is similar to what I have introduced and supported in the past, and seeks to fill a void for many veterans and their families. Colorado's fifth Congressional District contains the third highest concentration of military retirees in the nation. Recent estimates show that there are  as many as 175,000 veterans in the area, when including all of southern Colorado. This legislation will allow thousands of eligible southern Colorado military personnel, both active duty and retired as well as the many veterans living in the area, to have a chance to find their final resting place in the region so many of them have come to love and appreciate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation has been influenced by the growing military retiree and veterans populations in the Pikes Peak region as well as community leaders and local Veterans Service Organizations who have repeatedly brought this issue to my attention over the last several years. It is important to note the passion and perseverance of those that have supported a National Veterans Cemetery and have worked tirelessly on the issue. This legislation is truly citizen-generated and is a testament to the dedication  of veterans in the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="169">S. 169</bill>] Mr. President, the National Trails System Willing Seller Act will pave the way for the completion of our Nation's most outstanding national trails. The legislation will amend the National Trails System Act of 1968 to make clear that the Federal Government may purchase land to complete several national trails from willing sellers. The legislation specifically names nine trails that are spread across the nation. The Continental Divide trail, stretching from Mexico through Colorado to  the Canadian border, is among the trails that await completion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was successful in gaining Senate passage of this legislation in the 108th Congress and am hopeful that both the House and Senate will act on the bill this year.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="Introducing S. 171. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 301 Commerce Street in Commerce, Oklahoma, as the &quot;Mickey Mantle Post Office Building&quot;; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="171">S. 171</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague, Tom Coburn, to proudly introduce legislation to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 301 Commerce Street in Commerce, OK as the "Mickey Mantle Post Office."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mickey Mantle emulates the Oklahoma spirit of hard work, charity, and sportsmanship. He is a shining example of how commitment and dedication can lead to great success. I seek to name the post office in Commerce, Oklahoma, in Mickey Mantle's honor. He is still known to Commerce by the nicknames "Commerce Comet" or "Commerce Kid".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At age 4, Mickey Mantle moved with his family to Commerce where he grew up, having been born in Spavinaw, OK. By his father who was an amateur player and fervent fan, Mickey Mantle was named in honor of Mickey Cochrane, the Hall of Fame catcher from the Detroit Tigers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Signing with the New York Yankees in 1949, Mantle made his Major League Debut in 1951. He played his entire Major League career with the Yankees. He was a twenty-time All Star and named American League MVP three times. Mantle was a part of 12 pennant winners and 7 World Championship clubs. Some of Mantle's records still hold today. He holds the record for most World Series home runs 18, runs batted in 40, runs 42, walks 43, extra-base hits 26, and total bases 123.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mantle announced his retirement on March 1, 1969. In actually retired on Mickey Mantle Day, June 8, 1969. In addition to the retirement of his uniform number 7, Mantle was given a plaque that would hang on the center field wall at Yankee Stadium, near the monuments to Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Miller Huggins. In 1974, as soon as he was eligible, he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame demonstrating his importance to baseball and community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, Mickey Mantle's father died of cancer at the age of 39, just as his son was starting his career. Mantle said one of the great heartaches of his life was that he never told his father he loved him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After a bout with liver cancer himself, Mickey Mantle was given a few precious extra weeks of life due to a liver transplant. The baseball great was overwhelmed by the selfless gift of a liver from a stranger; therefore, Mickey became determined to give something back at the end of his life. Thus, in 1995, the year he died, the Mickey Mantle Foundation was established to promote organ and tissue donation, and Mickey Mantle will be remembered for something more than his heroic baseball career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation as we commemorate an outstanding athlete so that future generations will be as inspired by his example of sportsmanship and charity as we have been.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="173">S. 173</bill>] Mr. President, I introduce a bill to establish Medicare Health Savings Account, HSAs. This bill will make HSAs available under Medicare in lieu of Medicare Medical Savings Account, MSAs. I have long been dedicated to quality health care and believe that seniors should have the ability to make their own decisions regarding their health care, so they can receive the health care they need and deserve. As a senior myself, I appreciate how imperative it is that we seniors be provided with  a wide array of choices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My desire to see my fellow Oklahomans and all Americans receive the best possible health care is evidenced by my involvement in various health-related issues. I have always been a champion of rural health care providers. In 1997, I was one of the few Republicans to vote against the Balanced Budget Act because of its lack of support for rural hospitals. At that time, I made a commitment to not allow our rural hospitals to be closed and am pleased we finally addressed that important issue in the  Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 by providing great benefits for rural health care providers as well as a voluntary prescription drug benefit to seniors. In 2003, I also co-sponsored the Health Care Access and Rural Equity Act, to protect and preserve access of Medicare beneficiaries to health care in rural regions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to assist my State and other States suffering from large reduction in their Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, FMAP for Medicaid, I introduced a bill in the 109th Congress to apply a State's FMAP from fiscal year 2005 to fiscal years 2006 through 2014. The purpose of this legislation is to prevent drastic reductions in FMAP while revision of the formula itself is considered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a strong advocate of medical liability reform and have consistently been an original cosponsor of the Medical Care Access Protection Act and the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act. These bills protect patients' access to quality and affordable health care by reducing the effects of excessive liability costs. I am committed to this vital reform that would alleviate the burden placed on physicians and patients by excessive medical malpractice lawsuits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have also worked with officials from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS to expand access to life-saving Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators and many other numerous regulations that would affect my rural State such as the 250 yard-rule for Critical Access Hospitals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a supporter of safety and medical research, I have co-sponsored legislation to increase the supply of pancreatic islet cells for research and a bill to take the abortion pill RU-486 off the market in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response to the shortages of flu vaccines experienced in years past, I introduced the Flu Vaccine Incentive Act to help prevent any future shortages in flu vaccines in both the 108th and 109th Congresses. My bill removed suffocating price controls from government purchasing of the flu vaccine while encouraging more companies to enter the market. Also, my bill freed American companies to enter the flu vaccine industry by giving them an investment tax credit towards the construction of flu vaccine  production facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of my sister's death from cancer and a treatment we learned about not accessible in the United States that might have saved her life, Senator SAM BROWNBACK and I introduced the Access, Compassion, Care and Ethics for Seriously-ill Patients Act, ACCESS, in the 109th Congress. This bill offered a three-tiered approval system for treatments showing efficacy during clinical trials, for use by the seriously ill patient population. Seriously ill patients, who have exhausted all alternatives  and are seeking new treatment options, would be offered access to these treatments with the consent of their physician. I was pleased to learn that the Food and Drug Administration has announced a proposal to offer expanded access to drugs to terminally ill patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My resolution to designate April 8, 2006, as "National Cushing's Syndrome Awareness Day" was passed by unanimous consent in the 109th Congress. The intent of this resolution is to raise awareness of Cushing's Syndrome, a debilitating disorder that affects an estimated 10 to 15 people per million. It is an endocrine or hormonal disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body's tissue to high levels of the hormone cortisol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was brought to my attention thanks to a staffer with Celiac Disease and an Oklahoma Celiac Support Group that there is a great need to raise awareness of celiac disease; therefore, I worked to get my resolution passed by unanimous consent to designate September 13, 2006 as National Celiac Disease Awareness Day. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder and a malabsorption disease that affects an estimated 2.2 million Americans. Celiac disease is, essentially, intolerance to gluten, a protein  found in wheat, rye, oats and barley, as well as some medicines and vitamins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, I have consistently co-sponsored yearly resolutions designating a day in October as "National Mammography Day" and a week in August as "National Health Center Week" to raise awareness regarding both these issues and have supported passage and enactment of numerous health-care-related bills, such as the Rural Health Care Capital Access Act of 2006, which extends the exemption respecting required patient days for critical access hospitals under the federal hospital mortgage insurance  program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Federal Government invests in improving hospitals and healthcare initiatives, I have fought hard to ensure that Oklahoma gets its fair share. Specifically, over the past 3 years, I have helped to secure $5.2 million in funding for the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, the Oklahoma State Department of Health planning initiative for a rural telemedicine system, the INTEGRIS Healthcare System, the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, the Oklahoma Center for the Advancement of  Science and Technology, St. Anthony's Heart Hospital, the Hillcrest Healthcare System, and the Morton Health Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a long supporter of HSAs, I believe all people should have access to them since they provide great flexibility in the health market and allow individuals to have control over their own health care. Medicare MSAs have existed since January 1, 1997, revised in December of 2003, but they have not worked. No insurer whatsoever has yet offered any Medicare MSA under the current law. To fix this problem, my legislation creates a new HSA program under Medicare that incorporates a high deductible  health plan and an HSA account while dissolving the existing Medicare MSA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In tandem with my efforts, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service, CMS, are launching an HSA demonstration project that would test allowing health insurance companies to offer Medicare beneficiaries products similar to HSA. This activity points to the Administration's support of HSAs and desire to see all seniors receive the best possible coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the July 13, 2006 edition of The Hill, explains, "no legislation is pending that would integrate HSAs into the Medicare program . . ." Thus, my legislation is necessary because real Medicare HSA reform is needed in order for seniors to have true flexibility and freedom of choice in their health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under my bill, beneficiaries who choose the HSA option will receive an annual amount that is equal to 95 percent of the annual Medicare Advantage, MA, capitation rate with respect to the individual's MA payment area. These funds provided through the Medicare HSA program can only be used by the beneficiary for the following purposes: as a contribution into an HSA or for payment of high deductible health plan premiums. However, the individual also has the opportunity to deposit personal funds in  to the Medicare HSA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill also guarantees that seniors be notified of the amount they will receive 90 days before receipt to ensure they have time to determine the best and most appropriate HSA to accommodate needs. The bill also allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to deal with fraud appropriately and requires providers to accept payment by individuals enrolled in a Medicare HSA just as they would with an individual enrolled in traditional Medicare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please join me in supporting this important legislation to give our seniors more choices regarding their health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="174">S. 174</bill>] Mr. President, I introduce legislation requiring parental consent for intrusive physical exams administered under the Head Start program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Young children attending Head Start programs should not be subjected to these intrusive physical exams without the prior knowledge or consent of their parents. While the Department of Health and Human Services has administered general exam guidelines to agencies, the U.S. Code is not clear about prohibiting them without parental consent. To clarify the Code, my bill will not allow any non-emergency intrusive exam by a Head Start agency without parental consent. This would not include exams such  as hearing, vision or scoliosis screenings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This issue was brought to my attention by some of my constituents from Tulsa, OK, who felt their rights were violated when their children were subjected to genital exams and blood tests without their consent. I am pleased to see that the Rutherford Institute has taken an interest in this crucial issue and are representing my constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a father and grandfather, I believe it is vital for parents to be informed about what is happening to their children in the classroom. I hope that my colleagues will join me in support of this important bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="Introducing S. 180. A bill to provide a permanent deduction for State and local general sales taxes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="180">S. 180</bill>] Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to permanently correct an injustice in the tax code that has harmed citizens in many States of this great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>State and local governments have various alternatives for raising revenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some levy income taxes, some use sales taxes, and others use a combination of the two. The citizens who pay State and local income taxes have been able to offset some of their federal income taxes by receiving a deduction for those State and local income taxes. Before 1986, taxpayers also had the ability to deduct their sales taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The philosophy behind these deductions is simple: people should not have to pay taxes on their taxes. The money that people must give to one level of Government should not also be taxed by another level of Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, citizens of some States were treated differently after 1986 when the deduction for State and local sales taxes was eliminated. This discriminated against those living in States, such as my home State of Texas, with no income taxes. It is important to remember the lack of an income tax does not mean citizens in these States do not pay State taxes; revenues are simply collected differently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unfair to give citizens from some States a deduction for the revenue they provide their State and local governments, while not doing the same for citizens from other States. Federal tax law should not treat people differently on the basis of State residence and differing tax collection methods, and it should not provide an incentive for States to establish income taxes over sales taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This discrepancy had a significant impact on Texas. According to the Texas Comptroller, the sales tax deduction saves a family of four $310 a year, or a total of about $1 billion each year for the State's residents who itemize deductions. The ability of taxpayers to deduct their sales taxes will lead to the creation of more than 16,500 new jobs and the addition of $920 million in State economic activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recognizing the inequity in the tax code, Congress reinstated the sales tax deduction in 2004 and authorized it for two years. Last year, we extended the sales tax deduction for an additional two years. As a result of our efforts, the 55 million of us in the eight States with a sales tax but no income tax are no longer discriminated against in the tax code. Unfortunately, the deduction is only in effect through 2007, and we must act to prevent the inequity from returning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation I am offering today will fix this problem for good by making the State and local sales tax deduction permanent. This will permanently end the discrimination suffered by my fellow Texans and citizens of other States who do not have the option of an income tax deduction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is about reestablishing equity to the tax code and defending the important principle of eliminating taxes on taxes. Last year, the Senate voted 75-25 to instruct conferees to make this deduction permanent. I hope my fellow Senators will once again support this effort and pass this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="181">S. 181</bill>] Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to provide permanent tax relief from the marriage penalty--the most egregious, anti-family provision that has been in the tax code. One of my highest priorities in the United States Senate has been to relieve American taxpayers of this punitive burden.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have made important strides to eliminate this unfair tax and provide marriage penalty relief by raising the standard deduction and enlarging the 15 percent tax bracket for married joint filers to twice that of single filers. Before these provisions were changed, 44 million married couples, including 2.4 million Texas families, paid an average penalty of $1,480.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Enacting marriage penalty relief was a giant step for tax fairness, but it may be fleeting. Even as married couples use the money they now save to put food on the table and clothes on their children, a tax increase looms in the future. Since the 2001 tax relief bill was restricted, the marriage penalty provisions will only be in effect through 2010. In 2011, marriage will again be a taxable event and 43 percent of married couples will again pay more in taxes unless we act decisively. Given the  challenges many families face in making ends meet, we must make sure we do not backtrack on this important reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The benefits of marriage are well established, yet, without marriage penalty relief, the tax code provides a significant disincentive for people to walk down the aisle. Marriage is a fundamental institution in our society and should not be discouraged by the IRS. Children living in a married household are far less likely to live in poverty or to suffer from child abuse. Research indicates these children are also less likely to be depressed or have developmental problems. Scourges such as adolescent  drug use are less common in married families, and married mothers are less likely to be victims of domestic violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should celebrate marriage, not penalize it. The bill I am offering would make marriage penalty relief permanent, because marriage should not be a taxable event. I call on the Senate to finish the job we started and make marriage penalty relief permanent today.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="Introducing S. 182. A bill to authorize the Attorney General to make grants to improve  the ability of State and local governments to prevent the abduction of children by family members, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="182">S. 182</bill>] Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators HUTCHISON, FEINGOLD, LEAHY, SNOWE, KENNEDY and DURBIN in reintroducing the "Family Abduction Prevention Act," a bill to help the thousands of children who are abducted by a family member each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We introduced this legislation last Congress, and it passed the Senate by unanimous consent, but unfortunately, the bill was never taken up by the House. This is important and needed legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Family abductions are the most common form of abduction, yet they receive little attention, and law enforcement agencies too often don't treat them as the serious crimes that they are--too often dismissing the seriousness of these cases as family disputes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Family Abduction Prevention Act of 2007 would provide grants to States for the costs associated with family abduction prevention. Specifically, it would assist States with costs associated with the extradition of individuals suspected of committing the crime of family abduction, costs borne by State and local law enforcement agencies to investigate cases of missing children, training for local and State law enforcement agencies in responding to family abductions, outreach and media campaigns  to educate parents on the dangers of family abductions, and assistance to public schools to help with costs associated with "flagging" school records.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, over 200,000 children--78 percent of all abductions in the United States--are kidnapped by a family member, usually a non-custodial parent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than half of the abducting parents have a history of domestic violence, substance abuse, or a criminal record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, many State and local law enforcement agencies frequently treat these abductions as personal, family disputes. Approximately 70 percent of law enforcement agencies lack written guidelines on responding to family abduction and many are not informed about the Federal laws available to help in the search and recovery of an abducted child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too often law enforcement assumes that a child is not in grave danger if the abductor is a family member. Unfortunately, this is not always true, and this assumption can endanger a child's life. Research has shown that the most common motive in family abduction cases is revenge against the other parent--not love for the child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The effects of family abduction on children are often traumatic. Abducted children suffer from severe separation anxiety. To break emotional ties with the left-behind parent, some abductors will coach a child into falsely disclosing abuse by the other parent to perpetuate their control during or after the abduction. And in many cases, the child is told that the other parent is dead or did not really love them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, on Takeroot.org, a website devoted to the victims of family abductions, a young lady named Kelly told the story of how her parents were going through a bitter divorce and custody battle when she was nine, and her brother was six. Her dad picked them up for a regular visit, but then just kept on driving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kelly says, "If I close my eyes, I can still see my mother waving goodbye as we watched her from the rear window of our father's truck. ..... Little did we know that it would be close to a year before we would see her again."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Days later, Kelly started asking her father why they were continuing to drive--and why they were sleeping in the truck. After a while, her father finally broke his silence and screamed at her that her mother had given him the children because she didn't love them and that they would just have to learn to deal with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the next eleven months, they lived like fugitives on the run, often dirty and hungry, "with very little money and even less love," according to Kelly. "We left in the middle of the night, never saying goodbye to friends we may have made or people we met. I still see those people in my mind's eye. I miss them. ..... Mostly, I miss the child I was, the child I lost."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The harm caused by these abductions cannot easily be put into words. In many family abduction cases, children are given new identities at an age when they are still developing a sense of who they are. In extreme cases, the child's gender is masked to further avoid detection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Abducting parents also often deprive their children of education and much-needed medical attention to avoid the risk of being tracked via school or medical records.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the child adapts to a fugitive's lifestyle, deception becomes an integral part of their life. The child is taught to fear those that one would normally trust, such as police, doctors, teachers and counselors. Even after recovery, the child often has a difficult time growing into adulthood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In some cases, the abducting parent leaves the child with strangers, or locations where their health, safety, and other basic needs may be extremely compromised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, in Lafayette, CA, two girls abducted by their mother ended up under the control of a convicted child molester. When Kelli Nunez absconded with her daughters, 6-year-old Anna and 4-year-old Emily, in violation of court custody orders, she drove her daughters cross-country, and then returned by plane to San Francisco, where she handed the children to someone holding a coded sign at the airport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The person holding the sign belonged to a helpful-sounding organization called the California Family Law Center--but the organization was actually led by Florencio Maning, a convicted child molester. For six months, Maning orchestrated the concealment of the Nunez girls with help from other people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Luckily, police were able to track down the girls, and they were successfully reunited with their father. That success may have been due to the fact that California has been the Nation's leader in fighting family abduction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my State, we have a system that places the responsibility for the investigation and resolution of family abduction cases with the County District Attorney's Office. Each California County District Attorney's Office has an investigative unit that is focused on family abduction cases. These investigators only handle family abduction cases and become experts in the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, most States lack the training and resources to effectively recover children who are kidnapped by a family member. According to a study conducted by Plass, Finkelhor and Hotaling, 62 percent of parents surveyed said they were "somewhat" or "very" dissatisfied with police handling of their family abduction cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The "Family Abduction Prevention Act of 2007" would be an important first step in addressing this serious issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to pass this important legislation, just as you did in the 109th Congress.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="Introducing S. 183. A bill to require the establishment of a corporate average fuel economy standard for passenger automobiles of 40 miles per gallon 2017, and for other purpose; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="183">S. 183</bill>] Mr. President, the bill that I introduce today features language that would remove the legal ambiguity that for years has inhibited the Secretary of Transportation from raising fuel economy standards for passenger cars, and the measure would mandate that a fuel economy standard for passenger cars be set at 40 miles per gallon by model year 2017. By providing authority to increase standards for passenger cars, and requiring a specific fuel economy standard target, this bill would  provide consumers with fuel savings at the pump, limit the Nation's dependence on foreign oil, and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would remove from the current Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) statute the requirement that the Secretary of Transportation submit to Congress any proposal to increase or decrease fuel economy standards. This requirement has been deemed unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. This legal hurdle, coupled with years of Federal funding legislation precluding the Secretary from reviewing CAFE, has prevented increases in fuel economy in the domestic passenger vehicle fleet.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="169">S169</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Secretary recently completed a dramatic reform of the fuel economy standards for the light-truck fleet, and he might have made similar reforms to the passenger fleet but for the statutory ambiguity of the current CAFE statute. I applaud the Secretary for his recent CAFE increases for light trucks, and I commend the administration for its seven light truck CAFE increases in the last six years. But the time has come for the Secretary to increase fuel economy standards for passenger cars as  well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2000, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) issued a report that concluded that the benefits resulting from CAFE since its implementation in 1978 clearly warrant Government intervention to ensure fuel economy levels beyond what may result from market forces alone. The NAS panel found that CAFE has led to marked improvements in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, fuel consumption, and dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the United States imports almost 11 million barrels of crude oil every day, compared with only five million produced here at home. And over two million imported barrels hail from the Persian Gulf region. The terrorist attacks waged on this country on September 11, 2001, and the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East has brought into focus the need to reduce our dependence on all foreign oil. The savings achieved by increasing fuel economy standards for the entire U.S. passenger vehicle  fleet is essential if we are to increase our energy independence and national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also would require the Secretary of Commerce to create a national registry system that, for the first time, would enable the automobile industry to trade fuel economy credits with other industries that generate greenhouse gas emissions. Participation in the registry would be voluntary, and any entity conducting business in the United States would be eligible to utilize the services of the registry. Therefore, automobile manufacturers would be able to contribute or purchase emissions  credits with other industries that generate greenhouse gases in order to achieve compliance with CAFE and emissions standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, any change to fuel economy standards requires the careful balance of many factors, including national security, consumer preference, domestic employment, as well as the need for powerful and durable vehicles in rural America, including my home State of Alaska. The amendment would provide the Secretary the authority to balance these considerations, and to make the appropriate and necessary fuel economy increases. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="Introducing S. 184. A bill to provide improved rail and surface transportation security; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="184">S. 184</bill>] Mr. President, last year we made significant improvements to the Nation's transportation security system by enacting the SAFE Port Act, which strengthened the security of our Nation's ports and maritime vessels. Yet, during the conference on this important bill, the Congress failed to seize the opportunity to enact comprehensive transportation security legislation that would have provided real homeland security for our entire transportation system. The Senate-passed version of the  SAFE Port Act contained essential provisions that would have strengthened security in all of the surface modes of transportation, including passenger and freight rail, public transit, trucking, intercity bus and pipelines. But jurisdictional infighting and a lack of political will kept the leadership of the House of Representatives from agreeing to, or even attempting to consider, these provisions in conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the urgent need for surface transportation security improvements, Cochairman STEVENS and I are introducing the Surface Transportation and Rail Security Act of 2007, or STARS Act, to once again offer the Congress an opportunity to enact a comprehensive transportation security bill. We have all seen the possible consequences of an attack on critical surface transportation systems in Madrid and London. We have all heard about possible threats and foiled plots aimed at our rail tunnels  and stations here at home. The time has come for us to address these vulnerabilities and risks in a comprehensive and coordinated way that ensures that in the rush to protect one mode of transportation we don't shift vulnerability towards other, less secure, transportation modes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The STARS Act combines the rail, truck, bus, pipeline and hazardous materials security provisions that were included in the Senate-passed SAFE Port Act into a stand-alone bill, which the Commerce Committee will soon consider. These provisions were endorsed unanimously by the Senate during consideration of the SAFE Port Act, and the House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to instruct its conferees to include these provisions in the Conference Report--advice the House leadership declined  to accept. Additionally, the rail security portion of this package has already passed the Senate twice in prior Congresses and has been endorsed by railroads and rail labor alike. This kind of support demonstrates both the necessity of these improvements and the distinct possibility that we can finally enact these provisions into law this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation that we introduce today reflects the Commerce Committee's substantial expertise over the issues of transportation security. The time has come to advance these improvements, and protect the vital surface transportation assets that grant us the quality of life and economic health that we all cherish. Our legislation presents an opportunity to make immediate progress on transportation security, and it is my sincere hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting consideration  and passage of this measure as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, over five years since 9/11, much of our Nation's transportation systems remain vulnerable to terror attack. There are many reasons for the lack of action by the Federal Government, but we can no longer simply look the other way. Last year, the Congress had an opportunity to make significant strides to improve the security of our freight and passenger rail systems, highways, public transit systems, trucking and intercity bus operations, and pipeline systems. The  Senate passed my amendments and amendments by other Senators to the SAFE Ports Act to address the security of these important modes of transportation. In fact, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to instruct its conferees to include these provisions in the final conference report of the SAFE Ports Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, House Republican leaders stripped them out of the final version of the bill behind closed doors, instead enacting a ban on internet gambling. The actions by the House Republican leaders further delayed real progress in securing our homeland from terror. I believe the Federal Government must take a leadership role in securing our country from terrorism. States cannot on their own be left responsible for securing these interstate modes of transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am proud to be an author of the Surface Transportation and Rail Security Act of 2007. I have worked with my committee co-chairmen--Senator INOUYE and Senator STEVENS--to ensure this bill gets quickly considered. Its provisions are not new to anyone. They were considered, and agreed to, merely four months ago by the Senate. I am hopeful that they will again be quickly considered and adopted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill specifically requires accountability from the Department of Homeland Security, by ensuring that our rail systems have been analyzed for security risk. It authorizes necessary funding for making these security improvements and specifically includes $400 million for tunnel security improvements in the New Jersey/New  York region. I will seek further Federal funding for improving security of the New Jersey/New York region's tunnels and bridges in  additional legislation to be introduced this month, by working with my colleagues on the appropriate committees in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month, the Bush Administration proposed certain improvements to our nation's rail systems, but these proposals fell far short of what is needed to secure our country. For instance, the Administration proposal fails to take specific actions to improve the security of railroad stations, bridges, and tunnels. More people use Amtrak's Penn Station in New York City than use all three major New Jersey-New York region airports, Newark Liberty International, JFK, and LaGuardia airports, every day.  This bill takes a much more comprehensive approach, by authorizing the funding needed to make these important security improvements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's freight rail systems move some 12 billion tons of cargo, but we are not doing enough to protect those systems. Some of this cargo includes hazardous chemicals and other dangerous materials which travel within feet of our schools, hospitals, neighborhoods, and snake right through the middle of our cities. The potential for disaster looms large, as the misuse of these shipments can produce an effect that a weapon of mass destruction would on our communities. Clearly much more thought  needs to be put into how we move this dangerous cargo, and the Federal Government must be involved. The Bush Administration must agree with this assessment, as their proposal would strictly forbid states or communities from acting on their own to protect their residents from these risks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this important legislation gets considered and enacted soon. We cannot afford to delay any further these vital security improvements to our country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="185">S. 185</bill>. A bill to restore habeas corpus for those detained by the United States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="Introducing S. 184. A bill to provide improved rail and surface transportation security; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will introduce legislation denominated the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act. Last year, in the Military Commissions Act, the constitutional right of habeas corpus was attempted to be abrogated. I fought to pass an amendment to strike that provision of the Act which was voted 51 to 48. I say "attempted to be abrogated" because, in my legal judgment, that provision in the Act is unconstitutional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is hard to see how there can be legislation to eliminate the constitutional right to habeas corpus when the Constitution is explicit that habeas corpus may not be suspended except in time of invasion or rebellion, and we do not have either of those circumstances present, as was conceded by the advocates of the legislation last year to take away the right of habeas corpus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had Supreme Court decisions which have made it plain that habeas corpus is available to noncitizens and that habeas corpus applies to territory controlled by the United States, specifically, including Guantanamo. More recently, however, we had a decision in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia applying the habeas corpus jurisdiction stripping provision of the Military Commissions Act, but I believe we will see the appellate courts strike down this legislative provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The contention that the gravamen or the substance of habeas corpus is provided by the statutory review to the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia is fallacious on its face. All the statute does is allow for a review of the regularity of proceedings. In my prepared statement, I cite an example of litigation before a federal district court, where a person charged with consorting with al-Qaida asked: "What was the name of the person? He asked: What was the name of the person I'm supposed  to have consorted with? And the Presiding Officer said: I don't know, which, according to the opinion, brought uproarious laughter from the audience. Here a man is charged with consorting with al-Qaida, and they cannot even tell him the name of the person he is alleged to have consorted with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The hearing before the Judiciary Committee, which I chaired, contained expansive, detailed evidence about the proceedings under the review provisions in Guantanamo, which are grossly, totally insufficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The New York Times had an extensive article on this subject, starting on the front page, last Sunday, and continuing on a full page on the back page about what is happening at Guantanamo. It is hard to see how in America, or in a jurisdiction controlled by the United States, these proceedings could substitute for even rudimentary due process of law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I might add, the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act was introduced in the 109th Congress. I offered the bill on behalf of myself and Senator LEAHY. Consequently, we had this bill listed in the 109th Congress as a Specter-Leahy bill, and with Senator LEAHY's consent, it is denominated as the Specter-Leahy bill again in the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my prepared text be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="Introducing S. 184. A bill to provide improved rail and surface transportation security; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce the "Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007." Last September, during debate on the Military Commissions Act, I introduced an amendment to strike section 7 of the Act and thereby preserve the constitutional right of habeas corpus for the approximately 450 individuals detained at Guantanamo Bay. Because my amendment was not agreed to, by a narrow vote of 48-51, the right to the writ of habeas corpus was denied to those detainees.  The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus has therefore been suspended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 5, with my colleague Senator Leahy, I introduced the "Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2006" to restore the writ of habeas corpus and bring this country back into compliance with the United States Constitution. After all, the United States Constitution is unambiguous in Article 1, Section 9, Clause 2, where it states: "The privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it." Today, along  with Senator Leahy, I am reintroducing this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Habeas Corpus Restoration Act is very simple: It strikes the federal habeas corpus limitations imposed by the Military Commissions Act and the Detainee Treatment Act. In so doing, the bill affords aliens detained by the United States within its territorial jurisdiction, including those detained at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, the right to challenge their detention and military commission trial procedures by an application for writ of habeas corpus. It will ensure that the constitutional  right of habeas corpus is afforded to all individuals detained by the United States government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Framers explicitly intended to extend habeas protections to all, absent a case of rebellion, invasion, or the interest of public safety. This principle was ratified by the Supreme Court in the case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, where Justice O'Connor stated "[a]ll agree that absent suspension, the writ of habeas corpus remains available to every individual detained within the United States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This protection extends to those detained in Guantanamo since it is a facility exclusively under the control of the United States. In Rasul v. Bush, the Supreme Court held that habeas corpus rights apply even to aliens held at Guantanamo Bay. One does not need to be a United States citizen to be afforded basic constitutional  habeas corpus rights and the U.S. Constitution draws no distinction between American citizens and aliens held in U.S. custody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although some argue that Combatant Status Review Tribunals, commonly referred to as "CSRTs," are an adequate and effective means to challenge detention in accordance with the Supreme Court's decision in Swain v. Pressley, I couldn't disagree more. In my view, CSRTs are a sham. We have learned a great deal about the cursory review provided by these tribunals at Guantanamo Bay. They operate with very little information. Somebody is picked up on the battlefield. There is no record preserved as  to what that individual did. If there was a weapon involved, it was collected and mixed in with many other weapons. There is no chain of custody or even a record of what was seized. In sum, CSRTs are nothing more than a one-sided interrogation by the military tribunal members. These proceedings simply do not comport with basic fairness because the individuals detained do not have the right to know</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Typically, the CSRT will advise the detainee that the evidence against them is  classified and restrict access. The U.S. District Court in the In re Guantanamo case criticized the manner in which the CSRT required detainees to answer allegations based on information that cannot be disclosed. In a comical scene during the hearing, a detainee advised the tribunal that he could not answer an allegation that he had associated with a known al Qaida operative  because the tribunal would not provide the name of the alleged operative. Since the tribunal would not even provide the name of the operative, the detainee could not answer even the most basic of allegations. While laughter filled the courtroom at the time when the detainee could not answer this simple allegation, we should not forget the seriousness of this process and the manner in which we are treating detainees of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Military Commission Act's habeas corpus provisions were debated at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing held on September 25, 2006. At the hearing, I heard from a distinguished and varied panel of witnesses, including the attorney who represented Hamdan before the Supreme Court. Perhaps most compelling during the hearing was the testimony of the former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, Thomas Sullivan, who has been to Guantanamo on many  occasions and has represented many detainees. Mr. Sullivan was especially compelling when he made reference to a number of individual cases where the proceedings before the CSRT were completely insufficient. He cited hearings where individuals were summoned before the tribunal, but did not speak the language, did not have an attorney, did not have access to the information which was presented against them, and continued to be detained. These individuals either did not know what their charges</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The failure to afford habeas review rights to detainees has concerned Kenneth Starr, former Solicitor General and U.S. Court of Appeals Judge for the District of Columbia. In a letter directed to me as Judiciary Chairman, Mr. Starr expressed his concern "about the limitations on writ of habeas corpus contained in the comprehensive military commissions bill."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Justice O'Connor feels that detainees have the right to habeas review, but we are denying them this avenue of review, how are detainees supposed to rebut facts that they are not allowed to confront? This is why federal courts should be open to hear habeas petitions of these detainees. The Supreme Court is clear, and we should apply this precedent to the current situation involving detainees at Guantanamo Bay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the recent 5-year anniversary of 9/11, President Bush repeated his commitment to bring terrorists to justice. However, statistics tell us that most of the terrorists at Guantanamo will never see the inside of a courtroom. Hundreds will be held indefinitely. Of the over 400 detainees who remain at Guantanamo, the Pentagon says another 110 have been labeled as "ready to release." But the real number we need to look at is the remaining 325 or so detainees. How many will face trial? Media reports  citing Pentagon sources suggest that only approximately 70 detainees will face trial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This leaves approximately 250 detainees--more than half of those still at Guantanamo--who will be held indefinitely simply because the United States considers them to be too dangerous or in possession of sensitive intelligence information. These detainees will have no ability to challenge their confinement.  My bill will ensure these individuals held in U.S. custody will be afforded the basic constitutional right to petition for habeas corpus review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The short history of the Military Commissions Act underscores the need for this legislation. The day after the Act became law, the Justice Department filed notices in each of the 181 Guantanamo habeas cases pending before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, highlighting the jurisdiction-stripping and retroactivity provisions of the Act. In at least one noteworthy case, the District Court has already agreed that it now lacks authority to hear such a habeas petition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 13, 2006, Judge James Robertson dismissed the habeas petition of Salim Ahmed Hamdan--of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld fame--for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. While I disagree with Judge Robertson's conclusion that Hamdan has "no constitutional entitlement to habeas" because he was detained in Guantanamo rather than inside the United States, this conclusion demonstrates the lack of judicial recourse available to such detainees. Of course, the Military Commissions Act is not strictly  limited to those held in Guantanamo. In another case, on November 13, 2006, the Department of Justice filed a motion with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to dismiss the habeas petition of alleged enemy combatant Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri. Unlike Hamdan and other Guantanamo</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="Introducing S. 184. A bill to provide improved rail and surface transportation security; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on the first day of this new Congress, I join Senator SPECTER to reintroduce a bill to restore the Great Writ of habeas corpus, a cornerstone of American liberty since the founding of this Nation. The Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007 bill continues our efforts to amend last year's Military Commissions Act, to right a wrong and to restore a basic protection to American law. This is an issue on which we continue to work together and urge Senators on both sides  of the aisle to join with us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Justice Scalia wrote in the Hamdi case: "The very core of liberty secured by our Anglo-Saxon system of separated powers has been freedom from indefinite imprisonment at the will of the Executive." The remedy that secures that most basic of freedoms is habeas corpus. It provides a check against arbitrary detentions and constitutional violations. It guarantees an opportunity to go to court, with the aid of a lawyer, to prove one's innocence. This fundamental protection was rolled back in an  unprecedented and unnecessary way in the run up to last fall's election by passage of the Military Commissions Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Military Commissions Act eliminated that right, permanently, for any non-citizen determined to be an enemy combatant, or even "awaiting" such a determination. That includes the approximately 12 million lawful permanent residents in the United States today, people who work and pay taxes in America and are lawful residents. This new law means that any of these people can be detained, forever, without any ability to challenge their detention Federal court--or anywhere else--simply on the Government's  say-so that they are awaiting determination whether they are enemy combatants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I deeply regret that Senator SPECTER and I were unsuccessful in our efforts to stop this injustice when the President and the Republican leadership insisted on rushing the Military Commissions Act through Congress in the weeks before the recent elections. We proposed an amendment that would have removed the habeas-stripping provision from the Military Commissions Act. We fell just three votes short in those political charged days. It is my hope that the new Senate and new Congress will  reconsider this matter, restore this fundamental protection and revitalize our tradition of checks and balances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Giving Government such raw, unfettered power as this law does should concern every American. Last fall I spelled out a nightmare scenario about a hard-working legal permanent resident who makes an innocent donation to, among other charities, a Muslim charity that the Government secretly suspects might be a source of funding for critics of the United States Government. I suggested that, on the basis of  this donation and perhaps a report of "suspicious  behavior" from an overzealous neighbor, the permanent resident could be brought in for questioning, denied a lawyer, confined, and even tortured. Such a person would have no recourse in the courts for years, for decades, forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many people viewed this kind of nightmare scenario as fanciful, just the rhetoric of a politician. It was not. It is all spelled out clearly in the language of the law that this body passed. In November, the scenario I spelled out was confirmed by the Department of Justice itself in a legal brief submitted in federal court in Virginia. The Justice Department, in a brief to dismiss a detainee's habeas case, said that the Military Commissions Act allows the Government to detain any non-citizen  designated an enemy combatant without giving that person any ability to challenge his detention in court. This is true, the Justice Department said, even for someone arrested and imprisoned in the United States. The Washington Post wrote that the brief "raises the possibility that any of the millions of immigrants living in the United States could be subject to indefinite detention if they are accused of ties to terrorist groups."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, the situation is even more stark than The Washington Post story suggested. The Justice Department's brief says that the Government can detain any non-citizen declared to be an enemy combatant. But the law this Congress passed says the Government need not even make that declaration: They can hold people indefinitely who are awaiting determination whether or not they are enemy combatants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gets worse. Republican leaders in the Senate followed the White House's lead and greatly expanded the definition of "enemy combatants" in the dark of night in the final days before the bill's passage, so that enemy combatants need not be soldiers on any battlefield. They can be people who donate small amounts of money, or people that any group of decision-makers selected by the President decides to call enemy combatants. The possibilities are chilling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administration has made it clear that they intend to use every expansive definition and unchecked power given to them by the new law. November's Justice Department brief made clear that any of our legal immigrants could be held indefinitely without recourse in court. Earlier in November, the Justice Department went to court to say that detainees who had been held in secret CIA prisons could not even meet with lawyers because they might tell their lawyers about the cruel interrogation techniques  used against them. In other words, if our Government tortures somebody, that person loses his right to a lawyer because he might tell the lawyer about having been tortured. A law professor was quoted as saying about the Government's position in that case: "Kafka-esque doesn't do it justice. This is `Alice in Wonderland.' "</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have eliminated basic legal and human rights for the 12 million lawful permanent residents who live and work among us, to say nothing of the millions of other legal immigrants and visitors who we welcome to our shores each year. We have removed a vital check that our legal system provides against the government arbitrarily detaining people for life without charge. We may well have also made many of our remaining limits against torture and cruel and inhuman treatment obsolete because they are  unenforceable. We have removed the mechanism the Constitution provides to check government overreaching and lawlessness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is wrong. It is unconstitutional. It is un-American. It is designed to ensure that the Bush-Cheney Administration will never again be embarrassed by a United States Supreme Court decision reviewing its unlawful abuses of power. The conservative Supreme Court, with seven of its nine members appointed by Republican Presidents, has been the only check on this Administration's lawlessness. Certainly the last Congress did not do it. With passage of the Military Commissions Act, the Republican  Congress completed the job of eviscerating its role as a check and balance on the Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some Senators uneasy about the Military Commissions Act's disastrous habeas provision took solace in the thought that it would be struck down by the courts. Instead, the first court to consider that provision, a federal court in the District of Columbia, upheld the provision. We should not outsource our moral, legal and constitutional responsibility to the courts. Congress must be accountable for its actions and we should act to right this wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Abolishing habeas corpus for anyone who the Government thinks might have assisted enemies of the United States is unnecessary and morally wrong. It is a betrayal of the most basic values of freedom for which America stands. It makes a mockery of the administration's lofty rhetoric about exporting freedom across the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should take steps to ensure that our enemies can be brought to justice efficiently and quickly. I introduced a bill to do that back in 2002, as did Senator Specter, when we each proposed a set of laws to establish military commissions. The Bush-Cheney Administration rejected our efforts and designed a regime the United States Supreme Court determined to be unlawful. Establishing appropriate military commissions is not the question. We all agree to do that. What we need to revisit  is the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus for millions of legal immigrants and others, denying their right to challenge indefinite detainment on the, government's say-so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is from strength that America should defend our values and our Constitution. It takes commitment to those values to demand accountability from the Government. In standing up for American values and security, I will keep working on this issue until we restore the checks and balances that are fundamental to preserving the liberties that define us as a nation. We can ensure our security without giving up our liberty.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="186">S. 186</bill>] Mr. President, the legislation which I am introducing is the Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act. This legislation was previously introduced in the 109th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, the Department of Justice adopted the provisions of the so-called Thompson Memorandum, which allowed prosecutors to request that companies under investigation waive their attorney-client privilege, and that, absent such a waiver, prosecutors may consider the company's refusal to waive privilege in the charging process. As a result, the legal and business community complained that, if the attorney-client privilege is not waived, the corporation and individuals may get a stiffer charge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Justice has recently revised the Thompson Memorandum, with Deputy Attorney General McNulty substituting what is now known as the McNulty Memorandum. Prior to the release of the McNulty Memorandum, I had a number of discussions with Department of Justice officials, and I thank the Department of Justice for the effort which they have made, but it is not sufficient. The new memorandum is inadequate in its protection of the attorney-client privilege.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the McNulty Memorandum is inadequate in failing to protect attorney-client privilege, it does improve another part of the Department of Justice's prior procedure under the Thompson Memorandum, which effectively denied the payment of counsel fees so that people who were charged were unable to defend themselves without bankrupting themselves in defense. That provision of the earlier Thompson Memorandum was declared unconstitutional in a case in the Southern District of New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, again, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my statement be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="Introducing S. 186. A bill to provide appropriate protection to attorney-client privileged communications and attorney work product; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce the "Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of 2007," which remains necessary despite Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty's issuance of a new set of corporate prosecution guidelines on December 12 of last year. Although the new McNulty memorandum, which replaces  the memorandum issued by former Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, makes some improvements, the revision continues to  erode the attorney-client relationship by allowing prosecutors to request privileged information backed by the hammer of prosecution if the request is denied.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will protect the sanctity of the attorney-client relationship by prohibiting federal prosecutors and investigators from requesting waiver of attorney-client privilege and attorney work product protections in corporate investigations. The bill would similarly prohibit the government from conditioning charging decisions or any adverse treatment on an organization's payment of employee legal fees, invocation of the attorney-client privilege, or agreement to a joint defense agreement. This  bill will hopefully force the Department of Justice to issue a meaningful change to its corporate charging policies beyond the changes in the McNulty Memorandum, which came "a day late and a dollar short" according to Frederick Krebs, the president of the Association of Corporate Counsel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no need to wait to see how the McNulty memorandum will operate in practice. The flaws in that memorandum are already apparent. Moreover, before the issuance of the McNulty memorandum last month, the Thompson memorandum has been undermining the attorney-client relationship in the corporate context for nearly 4 years. In January 2003, then-Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson issued a memorandum to all Justice Department components throughout the United States entitled "Principles of  Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations." This memorandum, which was prepared on the heels of the establishment of the President's Corporate Fraud Task Force, set forth various factors for federal prosecutors to consider when deciding to prosecute corporations or other business organizations. The so-called "Thompson memorandum" lists a corporation's "cooperation and voluntary disclosure" as one of the chief factors to be considered in making a charging decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as the Thompson memorandum was issued with laudable goals in mind, the McNulty memorandum was, no doubt, the product of good intentions. Nevertheless, it continues to threaten the viability of the attorney-client privilege in business organizations by allowing prosecutors to request privilege waiver upon a finding of "legitimate need"--a standard that should guide the most basic of prosecutorial requests, not sensitive requests for privileged information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as the standard is inadequate, so is the level of internal review. Although the McNulty memorandum establishes some internal review for such waiver requests, it does so in a way that diminishes the importance of a corporate client's ability to communicate with its lawyers. The memo creates two different categories of privileged information and provides very little protection to client communications to the attorney while providing significant protection and DOJ internal review for attorney  communications to the client. The memo identifies the two subcategories of privileged information as: (1) "purely factual information," which consists of witness statements, interview memoranda, factual chronologies and summaries, and reports containing investigative facts documented by counsel; and (2) attorney advice to the client, including attorney notes, memoranda, and notes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first category of information, formally labeled Category 1 information by DOJ, may be requested with approval at the U.S. Attorney-level with consultation with the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division. The consultation requirement is not defined in any way in the memo. By failing to define what it means "to consult" with the Assistant Attorney General, the McNulty memo fails to say whether the Assistant Attorney General can overrule the U.S. Attorney's decision. Unless there  is a meaningful review of the U.S. Attorney's decision, it is difficult to see how the McNulty memo provides better safeguards for Category 1 information than the interim-McCallum memo, issued in October 2005, which mandated a U.S. Attorney-level "written waiver review process" for all attorney client privilege waiver requests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As noted above, the new McNulty memo does provide greater protections for attorney advice and communication to the client, which the memo labels "Category 2" information. The McNulty memo protects Category 2 information in the first instance by making clear that it may be sought only if the prosecutor thinks Category 1 information provides an incomplete basis for the investigation. If such a request is deemed necessary, the request for Category 2 information must be approved by the Deputy Attorney  General.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the McNulty memo provides greater protection for Category 2 information, the memo does not explain why such information will ever be needed  by prosecutors outside of attorney advice in furtherance of a crime or fraud or where the advice is subject to an advice of counsel defense, both of which are expressly exempted from the waiver request process outlined in the memorandum. Thus, the only two types of attorney advice that are likely to be relevant in a criminal investigation are exempted from the memo's coverage. With that exception, I fail to see why Category 2 information is needed at all. Prosecutors do not need to know what</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No less than the Thompson memo, the new McNulty memo discourages corporate employees from having frank conversations with lawyers, which makes it difficult for companies who desire to prevent possible corruption from making appropriate remedies. The Department of Justice will not prevent corporate misconduct if it continues to inadvertently discourage the types of internal investigations and dialogues corporate officials need to detect and prevent corporate fraud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the next rewrite of its corporate prosecution guidelines, the Administration needs to look in the mirror. If the President refused to disclose documents or information after invoking a claim of executive privilege, it would not consider itself to be "uncooperative." Rather, the executive would simply be doing its job in representing a client. Yet, when the tables are turned, the Justice Department has memorialized a policy instructing its prosecutors to discourage attorneys from doing their  job effectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The right to counsel is too important to be passed over for prosecutorial convenience. It has been engrained in American jurisprudence since the 18th century when the Bill of Rights was adopted. The 6th Amendment is a fundamental right afforded to individuals charged with a crime and guarantees proper representation by counsel throughout a prosecution. However, the right to counsel is largely ineffective unless the confidential communications made by a client to his or her lawyer are protected  by law. As the Supreme Court observed in Upjohn Co. v. United States, "the attorney-client privilege is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law." When the Upjohn Court affirmed that attorney-client privilege protections apply to corporate internal legal dialogue, the Court manifested in the law the importance of the attorney-client</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former prosecutor, I am acutely aware of the enormous power and tools a prosecutor has at his or her disposal. As former Supreme Court Justice and then Attorney-General Robert Jackson stated in his 1940 speech to U.S. Attorneys, "The prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and reputation than any other person in America. His discretion is tremendous. He can have citizens investigated and, if he is that kind of person, he can have this done to the tune of public statements and veiled  or unveiled intimations." Thus, the federal prosecutor has enough power without the coercive tools of the privilege waiver, whether that waiver policy is embodied in the Holder, Thompson, McCallum, or McNulty memorandum. I see no need to have the Justice Department publicly express a policy that encourages waiver of attorney-client privilege, especially where the policy is</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as the Holder and Thompson memoranda before it, the McNulty memorandum embodies bad public policy by empowering federal prosecutors at the expense of the attorney-client relationship. Consequently, I echo the comments of the following organizations and individuals who have criticized the McNulty memorandum:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The Justice Department's new corporate charging guidelines for federal prosecutors fall far short of what is needed to prevent further erosion of fundamental attorney-client privilege, work product, and employee protections during government investigations."--Karen Mathis, ABA President.&lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"While containing some improvements, this new policy does not adequately protect the right to attorney-client privilege, and unwisely ignores many of the recommendations of former senior Justice Department officials, the American Bar Association, and a massive coalition of some of the nation's most prominent business, legal, and civil rights groups."--Stanton Anderson, U.S. Chamber of Commerce.&lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The McNulty Memorandum still falls short of protecting the attorney-client privilege, and the related work product doctrine, which derives from it."--Martin Pinales, President, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.&lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"[T]his memo is a day late and a dollar short. Asking prosecutors to get permission before formally requesting that companies waive their attorney-client privilege will not put an end to the `culture of waiver' that exists within DOJ. Our research shows that more often than not, requests for waiver are not asked for outright, but are coercively inferred."--Frederick Krebs, President, Association of Corporate Counsel.&lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty's memorandum is a disappointment. It perpetuates the dynamic that compels companies to "voluntarily" waive their rights in order to get favorable treatment or to avoid the  death penalty of a federal indictment."--Caroline Fredrickson, Director, ACLU Washington legislative office; George Landrith, President, Frontiers of Freedom; Stephanie A. Martz, Director, White Collar Crime Project, National Association of  Criminal Defense Lawyers; Daniel J. Popeo, Chairman, Washington Legal Foundation, in a letter to the editor of USA Today. &lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill amends title 18 of the United States Code by adding a new section, &amp;#167;3014, that would prohibit any agent or attorney of the United States government in any criminal or civil case to demand, request or condition treatment on the disclosure of any communication protected by the attorney-client privilege or attorney work product. The bill would also prohibit government lawyers and agents from conditioning any charge or adverse treatment on whether an organization pays attorneys' fees  for its employees or signs a joint defense agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I am glad that the Justice Department revised the Thompson memorandum, I am hopeful that the Department will act again to reform the McNulty memorandum. In the absence of such action, this legislation is needed to ensure that basic protections of the attorney-client relationship are preserved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="Introducing S. 187. A bill to provide sufficient resources to permit electronic surveillance of United States persons for foreign intelligence purposes to be conducted pursuant to individualized court-issued orders for calls originating in the United States, to provide additional resources to enhance oversight and streamline the procedures of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, to ensure review of the Terrorist Surveillance Program by the United States Supreme Court, and for other purposes;  to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="187">S. 187</bill>] Mr. President, I am reintroducing the text of <bill type="s" number="4051">S. 4051</bill>, which I originally introduced on November 14 of last year. And the title articulates it in a succinct way, so I will read that. It is: a bill to provide sufficient resources to permit electronic surveillance of United States persons for foreign intelligence purposes to be conducted pursuant to individualized court-issued warrants for calls originating in the United States, to provide additional resources to enhance oversight  and streamline the procedures of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, and to ensure review of the Terrorist Surveillance Program by the United States Supreme Court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I made a number of efforts in the 109th Congress to subject the President's surveillance program to judicial review in accordance with the existing law that a search-and-seizure warrant or a wiretap ought not to be issued without a judge making a finding of probable cause and authorizing that kind of a search and seizure or that kind of a wiretap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without going into the entire history, that bill was refined to the point where it is articulated in <bill type="s" number="4051">S. 4051</bill> of the 109th Congress, which would provide for individualized warrants for calls originating in the United States and going out. That can be accomplished, according to the CIA, if there are additional resources, which this bill provides, and if the time for retroactive approval is extended from 3 days to 7 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to calls originating outside the United States and coming in,  we are advised there are simply too many of those to cover, so that on those calls the bill would expedite the judicial review which is currently in process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Federal court in Detroit has declared the President's program unconstitutional, and it is now pending in the Sixth Circuit. This bill would mandate review by the Supreme Court of the United States and would put review in the Federal courts on an accelerated timetable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are objections to proceeding with legislation along this line because of an interest in having hearings. Well, we have had a whole series of hearings, and the administration has refused to tell the Judiciary Committee the details of the program. Under our division of authority, it is the Intelligence Committee which has jurisdiction over this kind of a program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, we could proceed with hearings and still enact legislation which would provide constitutional protection for calls originating in the United States, which is the more serious category. Citizens here, people here in the United States, would have individual warrants and a judicial determination of probable cause before the surveillance and the wiretaps were put into effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, the program goes on. It has been going on since late 2001. It has been known to the public since December 16, 2005. And each day that passes, there are more taps, there are more searches and seizures, there is more surveillance, which may not comport with constitutional provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There may be the motivation to show that the President has broken the law. And there is no doubt that the surveillance program does violate the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. But the President contends that he has inherent article II power as Commander in Chief which supersedes the statute. And he may be right about that. But only a court can determine. And under the existing standards, the court must make a determination of the nature of the invasion of privacy contrasted with  the importance for the public welfare of providing security. That is a judicial function.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems to me that where you have an avenue to have probable cause established in the traditional way on calls going out of the United States, we ought to utilize it. We ought not to have that program continue in effect without having that kind of constitutional procedure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then, as to calls originating outside of the United States, if the President is right, that can be determined by the courts. Let that proceed in that manner. And, the justification for delay--that we need to show the President of the United States has violated the law--is a wholly insufficient justification to withhold legislation that would be a major improvement to this surveillance program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can conclude, in my view, that he has violated FISA. But to repeat--and I do not like to repeat--he may have the constitutional authority for the surveillance program, but that has to be determined by a judicial proceeding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="Introducing S. 188. A bill to revise the short title of the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="188">S. 188</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of legislation I am introducing today, which has the support and co-sponsorship of several of my colleagues including Senators REID, LEAHY, FEINSTEIN, BOXER and MENENDEZ.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a simple, straight forward measure to include the name of C&amp;#233;sar E. Ch&amp;#225;vez, a truly remarkable civil rights leader and American, into the title of the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act passed last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With my bill, the title of this Act would be referred to as the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King, and C&amp;#233;sar E. Ch&amp;#225;vez Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. I am proud to have been part of a unanimous Senate that reauthorized this landmark piece of civil rights legislation. Reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act extended the open door for every American to exercise their right to participate in the representative democracy founded by our Constitution,  and cherished by our people. In that spirit, it is fitting that C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez's name be included with the other names honored in this bill--as pioneers who helped pave the way to ensure that all Americans have a voice in electing their Government at the voting booth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez is an American hero. Like the venerable American leaders who are now associated with this effort, he sacrificed his life to empower the most vulnerable in America. For this reason, he continues to be an important part of our country's journey on the path to a more inclusive America. C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez believed strongly in our American democracy and saw the right to vote as a fundamental cornerstone of our freedom. I believe it is fitting that his name be a part of the  reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Lyndon Johnson once stated: "The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men." With his simple but powerful slogan "Si Se Puede" or yes, it can be done, C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez reminded us of this truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Still, throughout our history and even today, many Americans have been shut out of our most fundamental right, the right to vote. When President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law, he restored the faith of millions of African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, and others who had historically been kept from voting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As our Nation moved forward in the next chapter of civic equality and inclusion with the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act last year, we demonstrated to millions of Hispanic Americans this body's continued commitment to safeguarding their right to vote. To include C&amp;#233;sar E. Ch&amp;#225;vez's name to that commitment today is an important change because of the message it sends Hispanic Americans. It serves as a signal of Congress' commitment to an inclusive America that brings all Americans  into our democratic process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past November, more than 86 million Americans voted all across the country. Fifty years ago, before the enactment of the Voting Rights Act, many would not have been able to do so. It is important and fitting that we honor those civil rights leaders whose contributions and courage helped pave the way for today's more inclusive democracy, and it is fitting that the name of C&amp;#233;sar E. Ch&amp;#225;vez be included with them in the title of last year's Voting Rights Act reauthorization. I look  forward to working with my colleagues on this small change, and am hopeful that they will approve my proposal to revise the official title of this  landmark reauthorization as the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King, and C&amp;#233;sar E. Ch&amp;#225;vez Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300071" topic="Introducing S. 192. A bill providing greater transparency with respect to lobbying activities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="192">S. 192</bill>] Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senators FEINGOLD, COLLINS, and LIEBERMAN in introducing a bill to provide greater transparency into the process of influencing our Government, and to ensure greater accountability among public officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation proposes a number of important and necessary reforms. It would provide for faster reporting and greater public access to reports filed by lobbyists and their employers under current law. It would require greater disclosure of lobbyists' contributions and payments to lawmakers and entities associated with them, as well as fundraising and other events they host. the bill also would require greater disclosure from both lobbyists, and Members and employees of Congress, of travel that  is arranged or financed by a lobbyist or his client.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To address the problem of the revolving door between Government and the private sector, the bill would strengthen the lobbying restrictions on former senior members of the Executive Branch, former Members of Congress, and former senior congressional staff. It would require that Members publicly disclose negotiations they are having with prospective private employers to ensure there is no conflict of interests. The bill also would modify the provision in current law that exempts former Federal  employees who go to work for Indian tribes as outside lobbyists and agents from the revolving door laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would prohibit all gifts from lobbyists to lawmakers and their staff. To ensure that such a ban is not circumvented, the bill also would require Members of Congress and their staff to pay the fair market value for travel on private planes and the fair market value of sports and entertainment tickets. Members and staff would also have to post the details of their privately-sponsored work trips on-line for public inspection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would establish an independent, non-partisan Office of Public Integrity. Armed with a number of investigative tools, the Office of Public Integrity would investigate alleged misconduct by Members and their staff and make appropriate recommendations to the Senate Ethics Committee for final disposition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill would help us combat wasteful, porkbarrel spending. It would amend Congressional rules to allow lawmakers to challenge unauthorized appropriations, earmarks, and policy riders in appropriations bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, when I introduced similar legislation over a year ago, I regretted that such reform was even necessary. And, I voted against the bill that was ultimately passed in the Senate because it lacked a number of elements essential to true reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the need for such reform has only become more acute. The American people's  faith and confidence in this venerable institution has steadily eroded. The day after the mid-term elections, CNN reported that, according to national exit polls, voters were concerned about corruption and ethics in Government more than any other issue. I can tell you the polls, if not spot on, are not far off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During my travels around the country last year, it quickly became clear that there is a deep perception that we legislators do not act on the priorities of the American people, that special interests, and not the people's interests, guide our legislative hand. This loss in confidence is not limited to a single party or ideology; rather, it cuts across the spectrum. It is a perception bred by recent Congressional failures and scandals, which I need not chronicle here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can begin to restore faith in this institution by divesting ourselves of some of the perks and privileges that have somehow crept into public service. Take, for example, free meals and sports and entertainment tickets. The American people have rightfully come to see the abuse of such perks as a corrupting influence. In a string of guilty pleas last year, several lobbyists, former congressional aides, and a congressman admitted that such gifts were used as bribes. Quite frankly, there is no  good reason why Members of Congress and their staff cannot forgo such gifts from lobbyists. No one would seriously contend that they are necessary for us to conduct the people's business. A total gift ban would go a long way towards restoring the public's confidence in us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another critical aspect requiring reform is the ability of a Member to travel on a corporate jet and only pay the rate of a first class plane ticket. This bill requires Senators and their employees who use corporate or charter aircraft to pay the fair market value for that travel. While I appreciate that such a change is not popular with some of my colleagues, the time has come to fundamentally change the way we do things in this town. Much of the public views our ability to travel on corporate  jets, often accompanied by lobbyists, while only reimbursing the first-class rate, as a huge loophole in the current gift rules. And they are right--it is. I have no doubt that the average American would love to fly around the country on very comfortable corporate-owned aircraft and only be charged the cost of a first-class ticket. It is a pretty good deal we have got going here. We need to face the fact that the time has come to end this Congressional perk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when the public is questioning our integrity, the Senate needs to more aggressively enforce its own rules. We can do this not just by making more public the work that the Senate Ethics Committee currently undertakes, but by addressing the conflict that is inherent in any body that regulates itself. That is why I am again proposing the creation of a new Office of Public Integrity with the capacity to initiate and conduct investigations, uncolored by partisan concerns and unconstrained  by collegial relationships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. President, if we are truly serious about reform, we need to address what some have coined the currency of corruption--earmarks. In 1994, there were 4,126 earmarks. In 2005, there were 15,877--an increase of nearly 400 percent! But there was a little good news for 2006 solely due to the good sense that occurred unexpectedly when the Labor HHS appropriations bill was approved with almost no earmarks, an amazing feat given that there were over 3,000 earmarks the prior year for just  that bill. Yet despite this first reduction in 12 years, it does not change the fact that the largest number of earmarks have still occurred in the last three years--2004, 2005, and 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, let us consider the level of funding associated with those earmarks. The amount of earmarked funding increased from $23.2 billion in 1994 to $64 billion in FY 2006. Remarkably, it rose by 34 percent from 2005 to 2006, even though the number of earmarks decreased! Earmarked dollars have doubled just since 2000, and more than tripled in the last 10 years. This explosion in earmarks led one lobbyist to deride the appropriations committees as favor factories. The time for us to fix this broken  process is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this past election, the American people sent a clear message: clean up the way business is done in our capitol. As faithful public servants, we are obligated to respond. Let us respond meaningfully, to assure the American people that we are here promoting the interests of main street over that of K Street, and that we are more interested in public service than the perks and privileges offered us. Let us also remind ourselves that we came here in the sincere belief that public service  is a noble calling, a reward unto itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I therefore urge my colleagues in joining me on this bill. I think our Nation and this venerable institution will be all the better for it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300029" topic="Introducing S.J. Res. 1. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States relative to require a balanced budget and protect Social Security surpluses; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="sj" number="1">S.J. Res. 1</bill>] Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the balanced budget  amendment to the Constitution of the United States. I, for some years, along with my colleagues in a bipartisan way, have spoke to this issue. Today, in a new year and in a new Congress, Americans are eager to see a new direction for our country. They have seen Federal spending increase by $200 billion from fiscal years 2005 to 2006. They have watched the Federal deficit swell into  hundreds of billions of dollars, and they have borne the costs. Our spending system is broken and, in my opinion, so is our Tax Code.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new year is a time for new solutions to this problem. When new solutions that draw upon old principles of limited government and fiscal responsibility and tax simplicity and fairness are how you approach a problem, I think Americans once again will listen, and they will allow us to build a system that increasingly builds faith, once again, with the American people and America's taxpayers. It is simply getting back to basics. We must look at the big picture of Federal spending as a crisis  in our country and begin to speak the language that is fundamental to reform in itself, not instead of half measures or bits or pieces or nibbling around the edges. But as both of our leaders have spoken in the last hour to bipartisan efforts, they speak of bold strokes to solving problems for America, and I think that is what Americans expect</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the coming months, I will address all three components of the Federal spending crisis, including a flat tax and a budget process that reforms what we get done here, and that we get it done in a timely manner. I begin with a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. For many Americans, one of the signs of our deep respect for the Constitution is to acknowledge that, in exceptional cases, a problem finally rises to a level that it can only be addressed through a constitutional  adjustment in our government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe spending is at that crisis level and we here, Democrat and Republican, have demonstrated our inability to deal with it in a timely and responsible fashion. So it is time we act. My balanced budget amendment would require Congress to pass a balanced budget every year to ensure that Social Security surpluses are set aside exclusively to meet the future needs of beneficiaries and to require a supermajority in both the House and the Senate to raise the Nation's debt limit. In addition,  it recognizes that national security is a priority of this Congress by providing essential exceptions for war and imminent military threats. In other words, over the last several years a balanced budget amendment would not have deterred us from funding, as appropriate and necessary, our engagement in Iraq and to make sure the men and women who are there on the front lines today are adequately provided with the necessary tools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thomas Jefferson said it so well, and he said this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>.....with respect to future debt, would it not be wise and just for that nation to declare in the constitution they are forming that neither the legislature, nor the nation itself can validly contract more debt than they may pay?&lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His logic is simple. His logic is right. I urge you to join me in making fiscal responsibility constitutionally acceptable--and a habit--of this Nation's Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the first piece of legislation I introduce to the 110th Congress, I call on the Senate to pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, a bill of economic rights for our future and our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this joint resolution proposing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
