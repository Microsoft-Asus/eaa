  <narrative>HOUSE DEMOCRATS ADDRESS HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF AMERICA'S CHILDREN -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H9189]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400356" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago, the Children's Health Insurance Program, better known as CHIP, was created as a partnership between the States and the Federal Government to ensure that more children would have access to health insurance. Over the last decade, it has been received as a strong, bipartisan effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The success of the program is not questioned. Thanks to CHIP, the number of uninsured children has decreased every year for the last decade, except for this past year when the number of children actually increased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, the House will vote on the CHAMP Act, a bill that strengthens the Children's Health Program so that it reaches nearly all of the children that are eligible for the program. Currently, CHIP reaches 6 million, but there are 6 million kids that aren't insured yet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, there is simply not enough funding to enroll more children. But that is going to change this week,  when the House adds on an additional $50 billion over the next 5 years to the CHIP program. That will ensure that an additional 5 million children are insured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's once again act in a bipartisan fashion this week and pass the CHAMP Act.</paragraph>
