  <narrative>DANGER OF DEMOCRAT HEALTH CARE PLAN -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8403]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, health care decisions are often the most personal and important decisions ever made, and those decisions should rightly be made by patients and doctors, not bureaucrats and insurance companies. So it's concerning that the Democrat leadership plan to move forward with a large expansion of Washington-controlled bureaucratic health care under the guise of providing care for children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House Democrat plan would cost $50 to $80 billion, and include children whose families have an annual income up to $82,000, making 71 percent of all children in America eligible for government-run socialized medicine, a level of income where 89 percent of children already have private health insurance. Why? Because these Washington politicians believe they can make better health care decisions for America's families. They don't trust patients, and they don't trust doctors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a physician I know that the best medical decisions are made by patients and families. The positive solution is patient-centered health care, making insurance available to all patients and families. Let's put patients in charge, not Washington. That's what Americans want.</paragraph>
