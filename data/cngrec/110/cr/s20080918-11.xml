  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as the old saying goes:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If it were not for the last minute, a lot of things would not get done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, God willing, we are nearing the last minutes of this Congress and, God willing, we are close to getting a lot of things done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the better part of this Congress, we have been working on passing three major tax bills. One has been to put America on sounder energy policy. The second has been to prevent the AMT from raising taxes for millions of American families. The third has been to extend a series of tax incentives that are vital to American jobs and families. Frankly, on these matters, what unites us is far greater than what divides us. And now, at the last minute, it is time to get these bills done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this in mind, I have worked with my good friend CHUCK GRASSLEY, the ranking Republican member of the Finance Committee. Together, we have worked with the majority leader and with the Republican leader. We have worked with Senator Durbin and with Senator Kyl. All of us have come together on a way to get these major tax bills done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What has divided us on tax measures has been mostly whether to pay for them. Democrats have said we should. Republicans have said we should not. So we and the leaders have come up with an honorable compromise. We propose that we pay for the energy tax bill, that we not pay for the AMT bill, and that we pay for roughly half of the tax extenders bill. With this structure, we believe we can pass these bills, we can get a lot of things done, and we can help to bring on the last minutes of this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passing these bills would get a lot of things done. The Energy bill would help to create well-paid jobs in the growing field of new energy technologies. It would help to secure America's independence from high-priced foreign oil. It would help us to move closer to addressing global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The AMT patch would keep some 21.5 million taxpayers from being hit by a tax increase. We must not let more families fall into the AMT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tax extenders package would help provide relief in a time of economic uncertainty. The economy clearly is struggling and so are America's working families. Markets are experiencing volatility. In times such as these, Americans need tax cuts they have come to count on to help them get by. The tax extenders package includes the research and development tax credit to spur new, high-paying jobs. It includes a teacher expense deduction to help teachers who put out money from their own pockets  to buy school supplies. It includes a tuition deduction to give families needed relief from rising college costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As well, this package includes the mental health parity bill. The bill has been a long time in coming. We must pass this bill for many reasons. It would ensure that families facing mental health challenges would receive fair treatment--treatment the same as those facing other health challenges. This legislation is a tribute to the hard work of Senators Paul Wellstone, TED KENNEDY, and PETE DOMENICI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This package also includes disaster relief. It would aid the victims of the Midwest floods. It would help the victims of all recent federally declared disasters. It includes relief for the victims of Hurricane Ike and Gustav.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good package. It would make real progress on energy policy. It would extend needed tax relief in hard times. It would give us a chance to show American families that Congress can work for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let's hasten the last minutes of this Congress. With that, let's finally get a lot of things done. Let's do the work of governing that the American people sent us here to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
