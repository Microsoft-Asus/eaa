  <narrative>ORDER OF BUSINESS -- (Senate - January 29, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="457">S457</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say that we are going to work real hard tomorrow and the next day to get a lot of work done. We have so much to do. This is a relatively short work period. We have the stimulus package. We have foreign intelligence that we have to do. We have a lands bill from the Energy Committee. We have an agreement to move forward on that. We would like to finish the Indian health bill, if we can. We have a lot to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That being the case, we are going to have to have a vote this coming Monday. We are going to do it later rather than earlier, but we are going to have to work on Tuesday. Tuesday is Super Tuesday. I had talked to the Republican leader earlier hoping we could work something out, that we would not have to be in. Certainly, it is no one's fault, even though there is a lot of finger pointing going on. But we were not able to get much work done yesterday and today. So losing those 2 days, I do not  see any alternative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know a number of people would like to go home on Super Tuesday, but they can vote absentee, and I think the country will survive without Senators being there on election day. I hope everyone here understands we have a limited amount of time to do a lot of work.</paragraph>
