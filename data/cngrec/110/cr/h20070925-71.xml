    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thought I would reflect this evening on the needs of our children in America. Today we just debated a legislative initiative to attempt to respond to the health care needs of our children. The good news was the House bill understood that money was the answer to the uninsured children, $50 billion. We didn't quite get there. But I am committed to coming back so that all children can be insured, legal immigrants who have a right to be here and are documented,  their children can be insured. But we have to fight this battle. My question to the President is: Do you care?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then I want to say to this Congress, another young man is languishing in a jail in Jena, Louisiana. It is time to free Mychel Bell, someone who was inappropriately charged as an adult. He is representing thousands of young people wrongly prosecuted, minority young people, who have not been able to find justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So to this Congress, help us free Mychel Bell and the Jena 6. Enough is enough.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
