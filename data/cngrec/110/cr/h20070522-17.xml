  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, over 100 days have passed since the President's first request of additional monies for our troops, and still no money. As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to ensure men and women in our military have the resources and tools necessary to succeed. Just 2 weeks ago, we heard from nearly 3,000 of those men and women asking for our support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, politics should never interfere with wartime decisions. Unfortunately, some have taken this opportunity to score what they believe to be political points and undermine our Commander in Chief. Our troops deserve a clean supplemental that does not embolden the enemy with language of retreat and defeat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Democrat leadership should stop the rhetoric of empty promises of "we support our troops" by giving them the critical funds they need today so they can finish the mission we gave them and come home in victory.</paragraph>
