    <paragraph>I thank the Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in this town when a Democrat screws up, Democrats are reluctant to criticize. By the same token, when a Republican screws up, Republicans are reluctant to criticize. Today, Mr. Speaker, I intend to depart from this accepted practice and direct attention--if not criticism--to the World Bank matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Paul Wolfowitz was one of the architects of the war in Iraq. He was generally awarded low marks for his Iraqi performance. Then he was subsequently elevated to the presidency of the World Bank. Allegations of mismanagement of the World Bank under Mr. Wolfowitz's leadership have recently been prominently reported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congress may or may not become involved, and the two House committees on which I sit--Transportation and Judiciary--likely will not become involved, nor am I accusing Mr. Wolfowitz of wrongdoing. That is for the appropriate World Bank panel to resolve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if it is determined in fact that mismanagement did occur on President Wolfowitz's watch, I suppose two options would follow: his resignation or his retention. If the latter, the appropriate World Bank panel may consider attaching a shorter, tighter leash to Mr. Wolfowitz because the present leash--if there is a leash at all--appears to be inadequate. But based upon my limited familiarity with facts surrounding the World Bank matter, I opt for the retention of Mr. Wolfowitz in lieu  of his resignation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His questionable and misguided leadership regarding the Iraqi War, plus the allegations of mismanagement at the World Bank under his watch notwithstanding, Paul Wolfowitz has made significant contributions during his years of public service and probably deserves another chance with the aforementioned leash permanently attached.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, Mr. Speaker, if Members of the Congress openly criticize members of our own party--especially members of our own party--when criticism is warranted, I believe our constituents will applaud such objectivity. And I furthermore believe, Mr. Speaker, that fewer accusations of screw-ups, mischief, mismanagement and scandal will be voiced and hopefully fewer acts of screw-ups, mischief, mismanagement and scandals will be practiced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on that optimistic note, I conclude and yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
