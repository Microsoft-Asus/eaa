  <narrative>A TRIBUTE TO J. SHANE CREAMER -- (Senate - February 27, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1268">S1268</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I seek recognition today to express my thanks to Shane Creamer, on his extraordinary volunteer service to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as the State president for the American Association of Retired Persons, the AARP. I also express deep regret that Mr. Creamer will no longer serve on the Executive Council as the Pennsylvania State president for the AARP as he will be stepping down February 22, 2008. He currently holds the highest volunteer position within the AARP  and has since 2002.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1951, Shane Creamer graduated from Villanova University and in 1953 graduated from Temple University School of Law. During his time at each institution he served as student body president. Immediately after earning  his law degree, Shane spent 2 years in the U.S. Army assigned to the Staff Judge Advocate. Before entering private practice, Creamer spent 11 years with the U.S. Justice Department in Philadelphia, including 8 years as the first assistant  U.S. attorney and in 1968 served as the first director of the Pennsylvania Crime Commission. In 1968 he published the first edition of his first book "The Law of Arrest, Search and Seizure," which was used as a training manual for the U.S. Secret Service for a number of years in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1971, he published his second book, "A Citizens Guide to Legal Rights."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1971 to 1973 Shane served as the attorney general of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which was followed by a successful career as a trial lawyer specializing in civil and criminal cases with the law firms Carroll, Creamer and Duffy; Sprague, Creamer and Sprague; Montgomery McCracken; and Dilworth, Paxson, LLP. In 1980 he returned to Villanova University as a professor at the law school for 5 years. Shane has also served as chairman of the board of trustees of the Philadelphia Prison System  and as a member of the board of Goodwill Industries. He continues his dedication to service as a member of both the board of the Pennsylvania Prison Society and Joint State Government Commission's Advisory Committee on Wrongful Convictions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As president of AARP Pennsylvania, Shane championed the interests of Pennsylvania's 1,905,000 seniors. Older Pennsylvanians have certainly benefited from Shane's passion and tireless dedication. During his tenure, AARP fought for Medicare Part D drug coverage and won approval of a new State law that ends discrimination against older workers receiving Social Security. The AARP has recently helped strengthen the Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly, PACE, and the PACE Needs Enhancement  Tier in Pennsylvania, expanded the property tax and rent rebate program, and improved the State's long-term care system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shane Creamer is an outstanding advocate in the fight to protect the interests of older Pennsylvanians and truly a great supporter for the elderly. He will be missed in his capacity as Pennsylvania's AARP president as he goes forward in his future endeavors. I congratulate him on a brilliant tenure and applaud Shane's outstanding service to the people of Pennsylvania. I wish him, his wife Mary-Ellen, and all his family the very best in the years to come.</paragraph>
