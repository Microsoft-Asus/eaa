    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in the darkness of back rooms and the whisper of secret phone calls, American citizens may have been betrayed. Has our government become the Judas?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past 2 years, our Federal Government has secretly negotiated and cooperated with the Mexican government to provide illegals a reward for breaking American law. Not only will illegal entry be forgiven by amnesty but, get this, illegals will be able to apply for and collect American Social Security. The cost of such betrayal is millions of dollars. Hardworking citizens are going to be robbed of Social Security money that they are entitled to. Now many Americans and legal immigrants may  not receive Social Security benefits because they will be going to illegals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, illegals are not citizens of this country, and they should not be taking the benefits entitled to law-abiding American citizens and legal immigrants. It is morally wrong to expect Americans to pay money to people that are not even supposed to be on our soil. Illegals should not receive Social Security benefits. The welfare of America is being sold for 30 pieces of silver.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
