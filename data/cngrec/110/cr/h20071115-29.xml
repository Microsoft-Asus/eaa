    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are dealing with legislation today that seeks to prevent a repetition of events that caused one of the most serious financial crises in recent times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We understand today that we are in a worldwide problem economically, with a terrible shortage of credit, with some institutions threatened. There is no debate about what is the largest single cause of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Innovations in the mortgage industry, in themselves good and useful, but conducted in such a completely unregulated manner as to have led to this crisis, I know people have said, well, we may be exaggerating it. Here's what we recently heard from the head of the Blackstone operation:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The mortgage black hole is, I think, worse than anyone saw. Deeper, darker, scarier. The banks are now looking at new reserves and my sense ..... is they don't have a clear picture of how this will play out." That's from one of the leading private sector entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we have today is a bill that cannot undo what happened but makes it much less likely that it will happen in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fundamental principle of the bill, and many people have lost sight of this, is not to put remedies into place to deal with these problems when they recur, but to stop them from occurring in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had two groups of mortgage originators recently. We have had banks subject to the regulation of the bank regulators, and they've made mortgage loans. And then we have had mortgage loans made by brokers who were subject to no regulation, who had access to pools of money that were not regulated and could sell it to an unregulated secondary market. It is not the case that the brokers are morally inferior to the bankers. In both cases we are talking about people overwhelmingly who are decent  and well-intentioned. The difference is the absence of regulation so that pressures to do things that were irresponsible were checked by regulation in the banking area and were left unchecked elsewhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Essentially what this bill does in its most important form is to try to conceptualize the rules that bank regulators used to prevent loans from being made that should not have been made and apply them to all loan originators. Again, the goal is not to give more remedies when people face foreclosure when there have been abuses, but to prevent the abuses in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One question has been raised from some in the Attorney General field and elsewhere who say, what about our current efforts to deal with the people who were abused? Thanks to a very explicit amendment by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt) who, along with the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Miller), is one of the main authors of this bill, this bill will be entirely prospective in its effect, and people should understand no cause of action, no legal complaint, no  remedy sought against anybody who up until now and until this bill is signed many months in the future, none of those causes of action will be abrogated. Every remedy being pursued against past abuses and even abuses that may yet to have occurred, although we hope they won't, until this bill becomes law will not be stopped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is some controversy about preemption. The bill takes a balanced position which has made a lot of people on all sides a little bit unhappy. We do not preempt the right of States to decide how to deal with mortgage originators, with lenders, with any of those. We do say that with regard to the secondary market, we are going to put some liability on those who are the active packagers, and that's in some ways controversial; but we believe the unregulated secondary market was a large part of  this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do believe that you need to have some uniform rules if you are going to have a functioning secondary market. And we believe the secondary market has been on the whole useful but, having been unregulated, has caused some problems. So there is a limited preemption to that extent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are continuing to talk with people about ways to, frankly, improve this bill. There will be some amendments adopted today that will do this. It is a subject of great complexity with a lot of interlocking parts and some legitimate competing interests. We have arrived today, we think, at a reasonable balance. We do not believe that this is the way the bill absolutely will look in the end, but it is clear progress. And I want to stress the key point here is not in remedying past abuses. This  bill allows all existing remedies for past abuses to stay in effect. This bill tries hard to prevent this pattern of loans being made that should not have been made for a variety of reasons from recurring and causing that great damage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this legislation. I believe that it does, in fact, address abusive practices which, unfortunately, are in our mortgage lending market today. I believe it brings some needed oversight to the mortgage industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation that we are considering today is the product, and everyone acknowledges this, industry acknowledges it, consumer groups, Members on both sides, the membership has engaged for over 2 years in an attempt to come together to span political differences, philosophical differences, and to address the very serious problem in the housing finance market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend the gentleman from Massachusetts. He has allowed us to fully express our opinions. I believe that this long dialogue which we have had has resulted in consensus legislation which, though not perfect, I believe will achieve two very important, very necessary goals. One is to implement reforms that will offer consumers needed protection against predatory lending practices; and two, I believe, and I sincerely believe, that this legislation will preserve working Americans' access  to consumer credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Members most closely involved in the negotiations which led to the manager's amendment sincerely believe we have achieved these goals. We need not let the perfect be an enemy to the good. Members from both sides will address provisions of this bill which they believe do not satisfy the goal I have described above.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the fact that this legislation fully satisfies neither side is an indication that we are in about the right place in achieving a nonpolitical, legislative remedy to address this issue of such great impact to our economy and our families, both now and moving forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, let me say it has always been my view that when faced with serious issues like this one impacting millions of families across America, that Congress has both the privilege and the responsibility of rising above partisanship and acting in the public's interest. With this legislation today, I believe we have done just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to be able to yield to a member of the committee, who is not only one of the authors of this amendment, but has been a real source of strength to us in dealing with these issues throughout.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt) 4 1/2  minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400424" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the full committee for yielding time, and I thank the ranking member of the full committee who has worked with us and recognized that there is a serious problem that is going on in the real estate area, in the lending area, that must be addressed, and I want to applaud the efforts of the chairman for trying to address this issue in a comprehensive and fair way. And perhaps the greatest testament to the chair of our committee is that we have come  up with a bill that perhaps not any single person I know is completely happy with, including me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill started 4 years ago with an initiative by Congressman Miller from North Carolina and myself, and this was in advance of the escalating foreclosures, the kind of irrational exuberance that was taking place in the real estate market. We saw that this was coming down the road because lending was becoming more available, but it was also becoming more irresponsible because it was viewed as a no-lose proposition. So lenders were making riskier and riskier loans to people who had  more and more marginal credit and on terms that were not beneficial to the borrower but were financially beneficial, at least until the foreclosures started, to the lenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the predatory lending part of this bill, which is title III, started out as the base bill to address those concerns that were taking place that were predatory practices, taking advantage of vulnerable borrowers so that lenders could make money. Then the onset of the foreclosures started, and the crisis in the marketplace in general reflected itself, and that has resulted in the addition of titles I and II of this bill, which put a framework around brokers, which creates a framework for responsible  secondary market participation around lenders who dealt in prime loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Interestingly enough, over time, it is actually titles I and II that have become more controversial than title III, which was the predatory lending part of the bill. We think that the predatory lending part of the bill certainly has struck the best balance, because it is clear that with predatory loans there will be a national standard, but we are not preempting State laws and the States' ability to continue to innovate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In titles I and II, where we have created a framework for the secondary market, we have preempted some State laws, and we have had trouble finding the right language to do that. We want to do it to create a national secondary market, but we don't want to do it outside the specific requirements that are needed to control the secondary market and make credit available. So there is some angst among a number of us about the preemption language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said at the beginning, maybe the best tribute to all of us is that we have a bill that nobody really is completely comfortable with, and all we can say to all of those people is that we will continue to work on this bill not only after it passes the House today, but throughout the process to reach the more delicate balance and a satisfactory balance that at the end of the day will solve the problems in the marketplace and be satisfactory to all concerned.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400010" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I recognize the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) for 3 minutes to speak in opposition to the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400348" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do rise in opposition to this bill and to explain a line of reasoning that the Wall Street Journal and other critics have pointed out on their editorial pages. This proposal, in fact, is a trial lawyer's dream. What this bill does is it, with very murky language, forbids banks for signing up borrowers for what is termed "overly expensive loans." It requires banks to make sure that the consumer has a "reasonable ability to repay the loan" and insist that loans must be "solely in the best  interest of the consumer." This kind of murky language would invite litigation from every borrower who misses a payment. The Wall Street Journal says that if this bill becomes law, we can expect to read billboards reading, "Behind on your mortgage? For relief, call 1-800 Sue-Your-Banker."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the first time, under this act, banks that securitize mortgages would be made explicitly liable for violations of lending laws. This is a version of secondary liability that holds the bundlers and resellers of mortgages responsible for any mistakes of the original lenders. Now, the reselling of mortgages has been both a boon to the housing liquidity and risk diversification and, therefore, to lower interest rates for all of us that have taken out a loan. So to the extent that the bill adds  a new risk element to securitizing subprime loans, and it surely will, the main loser will be the subprime borrower who will pay higher rates if he or she can get a loan at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this debate is occurring during a challenging period for our mortgage market. What has transpired over the last few months has spread throughout our capital markets. It has the potential to slow the economy even further if we do this wrong. This bill is the wrong approach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we have had some signs of self-correction in the mortgage market. Lenders are underwriting mortgages  much more carefully as a result of market discipline. Products which have proven to be unfit for certain borrowers such low-doc loans, short-term hybrid ARMS, interest-only products, those are becoming increasingly hard to find. Those have been pushed out of the market. But the legislation before us today ignores such advances. Not only does this  bill fail to account for the progress made in the market, it has the potential to seriously restrict access to credit for millions of Americans looking to purchase a home or refinance their mortgage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In its present form, a borrower will have the ability to recover all of the principal and interest paid over the entire history of the loan as long as he can convince a court that he didn't have a reasonable ability to pay, as I said. At the time the loan was originated, again, it is not hard to imagine how language such as this is going to be abused and run up the costs of home mortgages for everyone.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I yield 3 minutes to another Member who had a great input into this, the Chair of the Housing Subcommittee of our committee, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank you and Mel Watt, Mr. Bachus and Mr. Miller and others who have worked so hard on this bill. It is a very complicated issue. You have done a spectacular job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Act of 2007. Each month brings figures, new figures, that reinforce the importance of putting in place a Federal legislative and regulatory framework that prevents us from reliving this crisis in the mortgage markets. I have a keen interest in this legislation because of the disproportionate impact of the foreclosure wave on my home State. California's third quarter foreclosure rate of one foreclosure filing for every 88 households ranked  second highest in all States and reflects a near quadrupling of the number reported for the same period last year. Five of the top 10 metropolitan areas in foreclosure filings are in California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, we need to prevent the now widespread practice of getting people into loans they simply can't afford. <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill> takes critical steps in this respect, including, for the first time, imposing a Federal duty of care on all mortgage originators and setting minimum Federal standards on all mortgages. Anchoring the bill's approach are newly established minimum standards regarding the borrower's ability to repay and net tangible benefit to the consumer. This is a sound strategy given that federally  regulated mortgage originators have long had to meet similar benchmarks, and not coincidentally, we have seen few problems in that sector of the market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill> also seeks to reduce the incentives to market inappropriate credit products to borrowers. I am particularly pleased that <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill>, again for the first time, removes the most destructive of such incentives, severing the link between the compensation of the originator and the terms of the loan. Minority borrowers have been disproportionately steered to costly loans, in part because the fees such loans generate for originators are higher than more appropriate products. <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill> correctly  prohibits this practice outright.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to have been an operational cosponsor of this very ambitious legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this passage today. However, I would not be telling the truth if I said I lacked any concerns about the potential impact of our ambition over time. Mr. Chairman, I certainly want to thank you, Ranking Member Bachus, Mr. Watt and others for your diligent work in the manager's amendment to address one such concern that I raised during the Financial Services  Committee markup of the bill, namely, the extent to which the assignee liability and remedies this bill creates should preempt State law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We want to make sure that consumers are protected to the greatest extent possible. Historically, many of these protections have been initiated by States, especially in the subprime market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I would like to conclude. I would like to be clear that this groundbreaking bill should be passed today, and I urge my colleagues to vote for <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling), who rises in opposition to the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I do rise in opposition to what I conclude to be a bad bill for homeowners in America. I do want to acknowledge, though, the efforts of the ranking member to take a bad bill and turn it into a less bad bill. There is no doubt that this Nation faces a great challenge in the subprime market, no doubt about it at all. I am convinced, though, that this piece of legislation is going to make it worse, make the situation worse, and not make it better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first thing we need to remember as legislators is first do no harm. What should Congress do to make sure this doesn't happen again? Clearly, there has to be enforcement. There's no doubt that fraud has taken place within the subprime market. But we also need effective disclosure so that consumers know the types of transactions in which they are entering. We need greater financial literacy. I agree, yes, that there must be mortgage broker registration. But what Congress should not do is essentially  outlaw the American Dream for many struggling families who may be of low income, who may have checkered credit pasts. By bootstrapping more, more mortgage transactions into the HOEPA standard, that is what this bill does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, by having assignee liability with all these amorphous legal doctrines and phrases that no one understands, you will drive investment away from the secondary market at exactly the time when it is needed more. As the market has perhaps even overcorrected, we need more liquidity. This bill takes us to less liquidity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I heard from one of my constituents recently from Forney, Texas, a lady by the name of Connie Taylor. She wrote me and said: "If it hadn't been for subprime lending, I wouldn't have my house now. My credit was destroyed because of divorce. I worked hard for 5 years to clean up that credit."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, we shouldn't take away homeowner opportunity from Ms. Taylor in Forney, Texas, and all the other millions of people who may have checkered credit pasts. Because of that, I urge that we defeat this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to another member of the committee, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is an important and urgent and critical bill. All across this Nation, families are struggling and suffering. In my own district of Georgia and in one of my major counties, which is Clayton County, which is one of the leading counties that has had over a 200 percent increase in foreclosures of homes, they have lost over $158 million in terms of their home equity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Mr. Chairman, the speaker just spoke a moment ago about one of the major features of this bill, and that is trying to grapple with assigning liability. I want to just make sure that everybody understands what we are talking about, because we are going to have that debate. Just what is an assignee? An assignee is a mortgage broker or lender, any loan originator that makes these loans but they don't keep them. They repackage these loans. They often are loans that are delivered to the secondary  market to a group of investors and these are parties that own an interest in the loan as it flows through the investment process, and they are known as assignees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since these loan originators don't keep the loans they make, they often deliver what the secondary market will buy, with little regard for whether the homeowners can make their payments or afford these loans. Unfortunately, many of them get into these loans on what is known as "teaser rates." They put forward a loan at a very low rate but, unbeknownst to the homeowner, in a short period of time the payment balloons out of kilter and the homeowner cannot afford it. Some people say this is not  by design. But in so many cases, they are by design.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what does that consumer have? He must have some recourse by which to have an ability to stop the foreclosure on his home. That victim has to hire  legal counsel to bring separate action against the loan originator. This bill attempts to address that. An assignee liability is an important feature of this measure.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400010" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, at this time I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Barrett).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I have a lot of faith in the American people. I believe that, given the proper tools, they can best decide how to spend their money. I also believe they can best determine how to borrow money, just as lenders can best determine who should be lent money. In other words, I trust free choice in the free market. Businesses should be able to take risks just as consumers should be able to. With these risks, come consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I understand we have a major problem on our hands, a problem that has spread far beyond the housing market to the heart of the American economy. Some homeowners are struggling to make mortgages they can't afford and financial institutions are stuck holding mortgages that probably will not be repaid. But to say all subprime mortgages are bad is an incorrect conclusion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, this legislation, Mr. Chairman, will not help those who today are in danger of losing their homes, and it will certainly not help the availability of credit for those purchasing homes in the future. This legislation will not add confidence to the credit market and will not help our housing market find its footing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was a small business owner in another life, and I understand when we make certain types of loans cost-prohibitive by adding burdensome regulation or liability, all those loans will simply stop being made. When we ban compensation for certain types of loans, the originators have no reason to make them, especially when they are now subject again to these new regulations and liabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than ensuring this market works smoothly through increased oversight and transparency, we are effectively legislating these loans out of existence and further tightening our credit markets. It is not a good thing for our housing market, our economy, or the free choice of our homeowners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, I must oppose <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill>, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to another member of the committee who has been very active in this issue, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412215" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>First of all, let me thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for leading this important debate in our country. No doubt, the American Dream has always been homeownership and yet, with exploding ARMs, with prepayment penalty and other such exotic products, that dream of homeownership has become an American nightmare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I'd love to be able to take every Member of this body through a tour of north Minneapolis. There are blocks on my community where every other house is boarded and vacant. The fact is that for the people who have made every single mortgage payment, and never late, they suffer because of this crisis because their home values have been dropping and plummeting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen our cities suffer, we have seen communities become unattractive nuisances, which were once vibrant places where people owned their own homes and did well. It's not because the market worked right; it's because it worked wrong. It's because of defective financial products, defective financial products which are addressed in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's important to understand that this bill is not designed to harm the subprime market. It's designed to reform and correct it and make it work properly, Mr. Chairman. The fact is that it does not help any homeowner who gets into a 227 with a prepayment penalty, who eventually can't pay the mortgage after it explodes in their face and then lose their home. We are not better off because of something that happens like that. That is what this bill is here to stop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Chairman, let me say that this is an important part of making the American Dream come true for middle-class Americans, making sure that when they buy a home, they can actually keep that home and that it will be a product that can enhance themselves and their families and the communities they come from.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus for working with Members from both sides of the aisle to craft legislation to help consumers secure sound mortgages and shine a light on the mortgage practices from day one of the home-buying process. I would also like to associate myself with the remarks of our distinguished ranking member, Mr. Bachus, and add just a few points.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I would like to thank Chairman Frank for adding two of my bills to the underlying legislation, <bill type="h" number="3019">H.R. 3019</bill>, the Expand and Preserve Homeownership Through Counseling Act, which has become title IV of the bill; and <bill type="h" number="3017">H.R. 3017</bill>, the Stop Mortgage Fraud Act, which has become section 212 of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why are these important? Well, first, for so many, the problems out there could have been avoided through one simple thing: housing counseling. If consumers understand what they are getting into before signing on the dotted line for a mortgage, they would be armed with the ability to make better decisions about a mortgage. Title IV elevates housing counseling within HUD, and the Office of Housing Counseling will expand HUD's capacity to offer grants to States and local agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language also tasks HUD with conducting a study on defaults and foreclosures and launching a national housing outreach campaign so that consumers know where to find a legitimate HUD-certified counselor. They can get the help they need now to buy and keep their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, section 212 of the bill authorizes additional funds for the FBI investigators and Justice Department prosecutors to crack down on mortgage fraud. It's no secret that organized crime gangs, many operating in Chicago, have discovered a more lucrative business than drugs. Mortgage fraud scam artists inflate appraisals, flip properties, and lie about information, such as income and identity on loan applications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, as a former real estate attorney, I know that any mortgage legislation reform should first aim to do no harm. By that, I mean five basic pieces. First, it should preserve access to credit and homeownership opportunities for qualified low- and middle-income borrows; second, facilitate transparency in the mortgage market; third, create a level playing field; fourth, promote strong underwriting standard; and, fifth, foster competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Achieving these objectives is critical for both primary and secondary mortgage market participants, from homeowners to investors. Has the bill under consideration fully realized these goals? I would say we have come a long way on mortgage reform, but our work is not finished. Today, several Members will offer amendments to improve the bill: the manager's amendment offered by Mr. Frank and Mr. Bachus, and additional amendments by Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite, Mr. Garrett,  Mr. Hensarling, Mr. McHenry, Mr. Gary Miller, and Mr. Price. I urge my colleagues to support these amendments. I would like to particularly thank Mr. Kanjorski for working with me on <bill type="h" number="3537">H.R. 3537</bill>, which we will offer as an amendment today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's important for future American homeowners and our economy that we put political agendas aside and get this right. Too much action and we worsen the problem; too little action and we allow it to happen again.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank Chairman Frank and my colleagues, Congressmen Watt and Miller, from the great State of North Carolina, who passed legislation in the  State legislature first and helped build a strong bipartisan bill in our committee that passed with a strong vote of 45-19. The economic crisis we are facing is no longer just a subprime crisis, but a credit crisis. Subprime losses are mounting and the economic  pain is being felt in communities across this country, as the ripple of foreclosures spreads to neighborhoods and local economies. Economists estimate that between 2 million and 5 million families could lose their homes by the end of 2008, more than the number of families that lost their homes during the Great Depression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats are working hard to help families stay in their homes and prevent another crisis like this from happening in the future. I submit for the Record a list of legislative actions and other actions that Democrats in Congress have passed to help families stay in their homes. With this bill, we take the first step towards reforms for the future. The bill would bring mortgage brokers who are currently regulated on a state-by-state basis under a nationwide licensing registry, establish  minimum standards for home loans, and expand certain limits on high-cost mortgages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>It also would prohibit brokers from steering consumers to mortgages they are unlikely to be able to repay. It changes the incentives for all market participants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would also establish some legal liability for securitizers, but it also provides some liability protection to those companies if they meet certain due diligence requirements in reviewing the loans they are packaging. Any legislation on this issue must strike a very delicate balance that provides consumer protections without unnecessarily limiting the availability of loans to creditworthy borrowers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the chairman for coming forward with a well-balanced bill on a very difficult subject that is incredibly important. I urge my colleagues, we must pass this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tackling the problem of subprime mortgage reform is like slaying the many-headed Hydra of Greek mythology--unless you go about it the right way, for each head you chop off, two more vicious ones will grow in its place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Chairman Frank for producing an ambitious and comprehensive bill that deals with many key aspects of this difficult issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a comprehensive and sweeping reform of the mortgage industry that would require all actors in the mortgage market to operate with the kind of accountability and regard for the consumer's best interest that the best mortgage lenders have always observed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this respect, the bill tracks the comments of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who said in testimony before the JEC that limited and clearly defined assignee liability could prove beneficial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To do this, the bill preempts State laws in the section dealing with securitizers, reflecting the concern that differing State laws would interfere with oversight of a national market. But it leaves States free to regulate in other areas where States have traditionally led the way in consumer protection for their citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a well-balanced bill and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to act quickly to stem the tide of foreclosures that could ruin families, communities, and the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House has passed legislation to enable the FHA to serve more subprime borrowers at affordable rates and terms, attract borrowers who have turned to predatory loans in recent years, and offer refinancing to homeowners struggling to meet their mortgage payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are providing much needed liquidity in the prime market right now. We passed a GSE reform bill in the House, but we should also raise the cap on these entities portfolio limits, at least temporarily, and direct all of those funds to help borrowers who are stuck in risky adjustable rate mortgages refinance to safer mortgages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To make servicers more able to engage in workouts with strapped borrowers, we pushed FASB to clarify what its Standard 140 allows for modification of a loan when default is reasonably foreseeable, not just after default.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress should eliminate the cruel anomaly under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code which allows judges to modify mortgages on a borrower's vacation home or investment property, but not the home they actually live in. This allows families to stay in their home while new loan terms are worked out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we should also eliminate the tax on debt forgiveness, sparing families the double-whammy of paying taxes on the lost value of their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our regulatory system is in serious need of renovation to catch up to the financial innovation that has surpassed our ability to protect consumers and hold institutions accountable.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Neugebauer) to speak in opposition to the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400441" topic="DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS ARE WORKING TO PREVENT ANOTHER CRISIS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I do rise in opposition to this legislation, not because of the spirit of compromise and bipartisanship that was used to come to this conclusion, but because of a philosophical difference. I believe that when markets have their ups and downs that it is better for the Federal Government not to try to intervene in those market cycles, so I think it is better to have better information than to have regulation when it comes to the issue of subprime mortgages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a little bit of experience in the mortgage business in that I was a mortgage originator. I was a homebuilder. I have sold and bought loans in the secondary market and I have owned a home and borrowed money on many mortgages. What I know is the system has worked, and we have record homeownership here in America today because we have had one of the most efficient mortgage markets in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what I do know is an important part of that transaction is that everybody in the transaction understands what the nature of the transaction is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the reason I worked in a bipartisan way with the chairman and ranking member, along with my colleagues Mr. Green and Mr. McHenry, to make sure that we had a better disclosure piece of information for borrowers to look at, a universal box, if you would, that would allow borrowers to understand all of the terms and conditions of this mortgage and to be able to compare that out in the marketplace. Because what we do know is there is a lot of opportunities for people to  get mortgages in this country today, or have been up to this point. What we want to make sure, Mr. Chairman, is in the future that they have that. But when they do take out that mortgage, they have the ability to look at the loan terms, the prepayment</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, I am pleased that in this particular piece of legislation there is a disclosure box that will help our consumers do a better job of making that decision in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I am disappointed in, Mr. Chairman, is the fact that we are going to, I think, put some very restrictive regulation on a market that may limit the ability for people to actually use that disclosure information in the future.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to urge support of <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill>, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007. As an original cosponsor, I commend Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus for how they have drafted and brought this bill to the floor. It reflects highly on the deliberative and bipartisan nature of the Financial Services Committee I serve on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is one of the most important and balanced bills we have worked on this year, because Americans' homes are central to their lives. Families save and sacrifice to come up with a down payment towards the most significant and personal investment they will ever make. They raise their families, they dream their American Dreams, and they look forward to a retirement secured by the equity they have established. When house prices fall, when access to credit tightens, those dreams are threatened,  and, for some, those dreams are destroyed by foreclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When talking with constituents in my district about the current mortgage market, some are having difficulty making their monthly payments. Most are concerned with being able to sell their home when looking to move. All agree that we need better  consumer protections, simpler disclosures, and greater market certainty. This bill does that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that the bill before us includes provisions from my bill, <bill type="h" number="3894">H.R. 3894</bill>, the Negative Amortization Mortgage Loan Transparency Act, which will make sure that all borrowers are aware of the impact a loan with negative amortization has by, number one, making sure that it is indicated that it is in the loan; two, a description of what that means, in that it can increase the outstanding principal balance and reduce the borrower's equity in their home; and, third, for first-time subprime borrowers  who select this type of loan, they will be required to meet with a HUD-certified credit counselor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill balances access to credit with necessary oversight and industry accountability to ensure renewed investor confidence and make sure that more Americans have access to the American Dream, but they have access to it for the long term. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Pryce).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400327" topic="DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS ARE WORKING TO PREVENT ANOTHER CRISIS">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for the time. I rise today in support of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home State of Ohio has, unfortunately, become the poster child for the mortgage crisis nationally. During the third quarter of 2007, each of Ohio's six largest cities were among the top 30 nationally for foreclosure rates. In Cleveland alone, one of 57 households filed for foreclosure during this quarter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So while our economy may be recovering from the impact of both the housing slump and the resulting credit crisis, and some places faster than others, it is imperative that we don't impede this recovery; that in our efforts to help the countless consumers and homeowners who have been hit hardest, we don't place the prospects of homeownership and refinancing out of the reach of families financially capable of managing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill balances that difficult task, and it has happened in an open, bipartisan process of negotiation. Along with the bill offered by Mr. Kanjorski, this bill adds regulation to the unregulated and restricts predatory products from the marketplace: adjustable rate mortgages with high prepayment penalties, no-doc or low-doc loans, teaser rates that reset only months after initialization, loans without escrows for the most likely to need them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill not only helps do away with these predatory products, but it empowers consumers with the most important tool of all, information. It is stunning to think that more than three in 10 homeowners don't even know what kind of mortgage they have. This bill improves disclosure at the point of sale, and the manager's amendment requires disclosure on periodic billing statements. It is important that people understand what they are getting into and are reminded of it on a regular basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the floor today, we will hear countless stories of heartache and heartbreak of families devastated by the rising foreclosure rates, of Americans losing their claim to the American Dream. This bill can correct that.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price) who speaks in opposition to the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS ARE WORKING TO PREVENT ANOTHER CRISIS">
    <paragraph>I thank my ranking member for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in opposition to this legislation, legislation that prompted the Wall Street Journal to say that this bill is essentially a "Sarbanes-Oxley for housing, an attempt to punish business in general for the excesses of an unscrupulous few."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, while the chairman and ranking member and other members of the staff have done really remarkable work to address some of the most problematic provisions, this legislation still raises serious concerns about the future access to credit. I believe that this bill will lower homeownership. It will harm the American Dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A good number of the new duties and requirements which this legislation imposes on loan originators are both vague and highly subject. Words like "reasonable ability to pay" and "net tangible benefit," these are required of lenders. This is greater regulation, and, as my friend from Texas said, greater regulation means less liquidity. That means not as much money in the market. That means fewer individuals able to buy homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Ronald Utt with the Heritage Foundation says, "This provision effectively deputizes the mortgage industry as a quality of life police force by requiring them to pass judgment upon what it exactly is that a borrower intends to do with any additional moneys required by the way of loan refinancing." This creates increased litigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, when <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill> was being marked up in committee, I asked him, the chairman himself, if there was a disagreement between the lender and the borrower about whether something achieved a net tangible benefit, where would that disagreement be settled, and he said, "Like any disagreements in this country, they go to court."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation also creates a new civil action for rescission, the ability to get all of one's money back. Clearly the result of this will be less availability of money to buy a house for all, but mostly for those at the lower end of the economic spectrum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there are alternatives. There are positive alternatives: increasing financial literacy, greater flexibility in refinancing, and greater penalties for fraud. And I hope as this process moves forward that we will be able to incorporate those things in a stand-alone bill that increases the ability to achieve the American Dream.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Miller) to speak in support of the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400277" topic="DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS ARE WORKING TO PREVENT ANOTHER CRISIS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support, but I want to express some concerns I have with the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been a long-time advocate of antipredatory legislation that will eliminate abusive lending practices while preserving and promoting access to affordable mortgage credit. I want to thank Chairman Frank for holding true to his commitment to work with me on ensuring that section 123 of the bill will continue to give consumers viable financing options that would not prevent mortgage originators from being compensated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the new language, consumers will continue to be able to obtain and enjoy the benefits derived from having the option to choose zero points or no-cost loans by financing the fees and their costs into the rate of the loan amount. I am also pleased that the mechanism by which the mortgage originators are compensated in such cases has been unaffected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, currently there are slightly more than 6 million nonprime loans. Of these loans, a little over 5 million, or 85 percent of these loans, are basically being paid on time. Yet, according to the MBA, under the legislation, perhaps 50 percent of the nonprime loans would not be made. This means that a significant number of consumers would not be receiving mortgage financing and millions of legitimate loans would not be obtained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there is certainly no question that nonprime borrowers have been subjected to abusive lending practices over the years, there is also no question that the vast number of borrowers who were not victims of such practices can become victimized by poorly crafted protective legislation that restricts nonprime credit availability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill, it significantly expands the scope of loans that qualify as "high-cost loans," or HOEPA loans. This section of the bill dramatically lowers the point fee calculations, thereby capturing a much larger number of loans than under the previous definition in current law. The expansion of HOEPA to cover the additional loans would provide access to credit to more nonprime borrowers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the markup, I attempted to amend this section to ensure that lenders would still provide and borrowers could still obtain HOEPA loans under this bill. My amendment would not have revised the substantive protection provided by HOEPA as amended. Rather, it would have limited the increase in the number of types of loans that are subject to HOEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the provisions of title III were drafted at least a year before the drafting of titles I and II of this bill, and title III was written without the benefit of enhanced consumer protection provided to nonprime borrowers  under the other sections of the bill. I am concerned that the three titles have been joined into a single bill without the respective provisions being synchronized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By expanding the scope of loans covered by HOEPA, we will further limit liquidity and drastically shrink the availability of mortgage credit. In fact, under current law, the liability and penalties extended to HOEPA loans have made creditors reluctant to make these loans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill>, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act. My home State of Indiana has been one of the hardest hit by foreclosures. We rank well above the national average with 3 percent of our loans in foreclosure.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412202" topic="DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS ARE WORKING TO PREVENT ANOTHER CRISIS">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many others, I very much appreciate the tone and the effort of the chairman and the ranking member to come to terms with a very difficult problem that is facing our country, and that is the subprime mortgage crisis and the ripple effect, the profound ripple effect it is having throughout the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My sense, though, is that while there are some very good elements in the bill, I appreciate the fact that it is prospective, I appreciate the fact that it is not a bailout, and I appreciate the fact that its focus is limited to subprime mortgages and not prime mortgages, there is an element that is of enough concern to me to come to the floor and bring it to the House's attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not unique in bringing it to the House's attention, but I urge a real sense of caution, and I think we can do slightly better, and that is the ambiguity of some of the phrases and definitions in the bill. The gentleman from Georgia referenced these in his remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when regulatory language, as this is, has words like "appropriate" without further definition; "ability to repay" without further definition; and "net tangible benefit" without further definition, I think it is a weakness in the bill, and I think it is a fatal flaw in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hope is that these ambiguities will be cleaned up. I am not one that says we necessarily need to yield this turf to the regulators. I think we as Members of Congress have that ability and that responsibility to define these terms. Because if we don't, I think what will happen is that capital that is currently available to subprime borrowers will become unavailable to some subprime borrowers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is language that creates the purported safe harbor in the bill, but it is a safe harbor that does not end with a period at the end of the sentence, essentially. It is a safe harbor that has a comma at the end and is simply a rebuttable presumption. So safe harbors are mostly safe, but not entirely safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think Americans like to be governed with a light touch and not a heavy hand, and I hope that we can revisit this bill when it may come back from the other body.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I now yield to another member of the committee who has been active on this issue, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Murphy), for 2 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS ARE WORKING TO PREVENT ANOTHER CRISIS">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Chairman Miller and Mr. Watt for their leadership in bringing this bill through the committee. I want to draw attention to one provision of the bill and underscore the importance of the provisions here that prohibit steering of borrowers into higher-cost mortgages than they would otherwise qualify for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This mirrors legislation that I introduced earlier this year, <bill type="h" number="3813">H.R. 3813</bill>, the Mortgage Kickback Prevention Act. The bill before us prevents mortgage originators from inappropriately steering consumers into higher-cost loans than they would otherwise qualify for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a commonsense measure, and it is made more reasonable by the restriction to apply this only to subprime loans. To me and my constituents, it is pretty simple. Brokers and mortgage originators shouldn't have an incentive to put borrowers into more expensive loans than they would otherwise qualify for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, as we move forward, I think it is important to understand that disclosure doesn't do the entire trick here. Most borrowers have no idea what it means when their broker discloses that they are going to pay a yield-spread premium amidst the mountains of paperwork that you are required to fill out for a residential mortgage. For these borrowers who have the least amount of leverage in the process, we need to have some clear lines. This bill does that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why it makes sense to simply say the brokers and originators cannot inappropriately put borrowers into loans they otherwise would not qualify for. This Congress has responsibility, as we are doing today, to reset the rules.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry) to speak in opposition to the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400644" topic="DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS ARE WORKING TO PREVENT ANOTHER CRISIS">
    <paragraph>I thank the ranking member for yielding time, and I appreciate his leadership and friendship on the committee. He has worked very hard on this issue, as has the whole committee. But we have come to different conclusions on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think there are some admirable parts of this legislation. In particular, the addition that the ranking member was able to make in consultation with the chairman on licensing of mortgage brokers. I think that is helpful and positive and makes consumers more aware of people they are dealing with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also believe the Green-McHenry-Neugebauer amendment that we were able to put in place in the committee is very help to the marketplace. It gives borrowers more understanding of the financial product they are about to take part in, the financial transaction they are about to take part of in. I think informed consumers are better off than uninformed consumers. Financial literacy is key; and, therefore, the process of counseling which is within this bill is helpful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in the end, this is about homeownership. It is about the opportunity for families to get a home of their choosing. It is about families making a financial decision for themselves, not Washington, D.C. telling them what products they can and cannot get. Unfortunately, that is what this bill does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will limit homeownership and limit the opportunities that families have by limiting the mortgage choices in the private sector and in the marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, it does nothing to fix the current crisis we are in. Let me repeat that: this bill will do nothing to fix the current mortgage crisis we are facing. In fact, rather, it will deepen the crisis we are facing by limiting people's opportunities to refinance or finance their home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me give you a couple of examples. This bill I believe will encourage more litigation and have a chilling effect on the secondary markets. Therefore, less money will be available for people to get mortgages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, it will limit the loan terms available. In fact, it limits the ability for people to finance the points and fees and closing costs of many mortgage products and bans prepayment penalties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, in essence, if somebody currently has a prepayment penalty in their mortgage that they have and they seek refinancing, they will be unable to finance that prepayment penalty that they currently have, thereby locking them into a cycle of debt and foreclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this bill is harmful to long-term homeownership in America that is at an all-time high. I think what we should be doing is encouraging homeownership in this country and making more opportunities available to get the credit that they need in order to get a home for their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I oppose this bill on very simple grounds: that it will limit homeownership and limit the opportunities and options that Americans have. With that, I encourage my colleagues to vote "no" on this bill and help homeownership in America.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS ARE WORKING TO PREVENT ANOTHER CRISIS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I now yield to a man who is going to have a lot of free time after today because much of his life in the last year has been helping put this bill together in a very masterful way, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Miller), for 4 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400280" topic="DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS ARE WORKING TO PREVENT ANOTHER CRISIS">
    <paragraph>I dearly wish that this bill was the one being described by so many people on the other side of the aisle. That sounds like a really tough bill. And this bill, I hope, will become tougher as we go along.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with many over there who said that they support the idea of homeownership and want to make sure that there is a mortgage market that lets people buy homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the mortgages we are talking about have nothing to do with homeownership. According to the mortgage bankers themselves, who oppose this bill, 72 percent of subprime loans are refinances, not purchase money mortgages. And only about one in 10 subprime loans is to buy a first home. Lehman Brothers says that 30 percent of the subprime loans entered last year will result in final foreclosure, a family being turned out on the streets by a sheriff because their home was sold at a foreclosure  auction at the steps of the courthouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do the math. One subprime loan in 10 helps people buy a home, a first home, get into homeownership. Thirty percent will result in foreclosure. The loans that we need to get at, we need to prohibit, are costing Americans homeownership, not helping with homeownership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, several speakers have said that they think the consumers should make choices, there should be a variety of choices available to consumers. Sometimes they say this bill will shut down market innovation. Well, Americans are for innovation, Mr. Chairman, just as they are for reform. Americans are fundamentally reformers so politicians have figured out to call everything they do a "reform," however obviously contrary to the public interest it is. And now American business has learned to call  everything they do an "innovation," regardless of how bad it hurts consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can think of many wonderful innovations. When we think of an innovation, we think of a scientist in a lab coat coming up with new products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am now the age my father was when he died of a heart attack in 1965. There wasn't a thing we could do to help people with heart disease in 1965. But I am on a cholesterol medicine because I inherited from my father high cholesterol that I hope will allow me to outlive my father. I think that drug is an important innovation, and I am glad we made that innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this necktie is an innovation. Ten years ago, you could not buy a silk necktie that was stain resistant. And for those folks like me who tend to miss their mouth from time to time, the cost in new neckties in any given year was hundreds of dollars. But this tie has a nanotechnology process that causes liquids to bead up and roll off rather than soak in and stain. This necktie is an important innovation to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what on Earth do we mean when we say that a mortgage is innovative? It means simply that there is no end to the variety of terms, there is a proliferation of indecipherable terms that are not designed to help consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alan Greenspan called them "exotic loans." Others have called them "toxic loans." The innovation is not really about allowing consumers to tailor narrowly the loan they get to their specific circumstances. The late Ned Gramlich, a well-regarded former Federal Reserve Board governor, asked why was it that the riskiest loans were being sold to the least sophisticated consumers. It was a rhetorical question. He knew the answer. He knew those loans were being sold to people to take advantage  of them, to separate from middle-class homeowners more and more of the equity in their home, to trap them in a cycle of having to borrow and borrow again, and every time they borrowed, losing more of the equity in their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the other speakers have talked about the importance of refinancing out. Mr. Chairman, a mortgage system where people have to borrow money to pay off the mortgage they are in now is not a mortgage system that works.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400061" topic="DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS ARE WORKING TO PREVENT ANOTHER CRISIS">
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the gentleman from Alabama for recognizing me and yielding me the time, and I greatly appreciate the leadership of the chairman and ranking member on the Committee of Financial Services for bringing this important legislation before the House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us is a bipartisan response to a problem that is affecting every congressional district across this Nation, the rising number of foreclosures and a large number of impending alternative mortgage resets, combined with a large number of delinquencies in mortgage payments. It is very important for Members to look at this legislation in its entirety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When combined on the whole, the components of this legislation will provide consumers with the necessary tools and protections to hopefully avoid another housing crisis like we are experiencing, but also realize the importance of not clamping down so hard, and we have heard some folks express concern about this, that we still have the innovations and we still have the ability of subprime mortgages for those who are now living because of the benefits that subprime benefits allows them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this bill, we require the registration of all originators under a national registry will be established by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators. These new licensing requirements, coupled with the national registry, will make it much more difficult for fraudulent originators to bounce from State to State. This is a problem my State of West Virginia has expressed concern about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another component that Mrs. Biggert talked about in her statement is to provide consumers with greater access to housing counseling. The availability of counseling will help individuals learn and understand the complicated financial disclosures, all of the paperwork and technical languages that come along with securing and purchasing a mortgage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another important reform that was adopted during our committee markup is the inclusion of a one-page estimate outlining the total cost and potential changes in the cost for the consumer over the life of the mortgage product. I have been lucky enough to be a homeowner, and I know when we go in to close at the time to secure our mortgage, the amount of paper and signatures that you have to go through to try to figure out what you are doing is very intimidating. So to have this one-page disclosure  I think gives the consumer the ability to have this information right in front of them so they can know what they are getting into and making this process easier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also provides more certainty and clarity for the liability of the entities that purchase mortgages on the secondary market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to particularly thank the chairman of the committee for helping me work through the technicalities of this language to explain to my local newspaper and my local consumer advocates what this language means in the bill. We live in a national economy and must recognize the need for consistency across the board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the bipartisan underlying legislation, we will also be considering I think a very important addition to this bill, an amendment I have worked on with Mr. Kanjorski and Mrs. Biggert that will provide additional protection for consumers. This amendment will now require escrow accounts for some mortgages and will provide borrowers with the budgeting tools necessary to properly manage taxes and insurances on their property. This amendment will also include Federal  appraisal standards with serious penalties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I fully support this bill and thank the chairman and the ranking member.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield myself my remaining time to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Alabama.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Alabama, this has been a collaborative effort in many ways. We have had some disagreements, but there has been a lot of agreement. And the gentleman from Alabama in particular took the lead in the language that went into the bill in committee and is being refined here dealing with nationwide registration requirements, a prerequisite for any kind of enforcement. Now, I appreciated the work he did and the committee benefited from it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Community banks are obviously very important in this. And, indeed, if only community banks had made loans for mortgages, we wouldn't have a crisis. But we don't want to interfere with their ability to help going forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would just yield to the gentleman in a minute to have him give his interpretation. My view is, and I defer to him as the spokesperson for the committee on this, because we are here talking about language which he developed and which we incorporated. We do have some regulatory requirements here that would affect not just the brokers but community banks. And I assume my colleague from Alabama, in drafting this, certainly intended and we meant to do this in the language, that the regulatory agencies  would be able to show some flexibility in terms of the impact of these requirements on our community banks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would yield to my friend from Alabama on that point.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400010" topic="DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS ARE WORKING TO PREVENT ANOTHER CRISIS">
    <paragraph>The chairman is correct. Section 107 was designed and implemented to give the Federal bank regulators flexibility in implementing the national registry. And it is the intention of the committee, of the entire committee, that, as they do this implementation, that they give proper consideration to its impact on small financial institutions, smaller impact, and that they try to minimize that impact.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS ARE WORKING TO PREVENT ANOTHER CRISIS">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman. In my closing seconds, let me just reiterate an important point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Attorneys General have been concerned about their ability to prosecute and defend against certain abuses. Thanks to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt), the effective date of this bill and all of its provisions will be the date of enactment. What that means is that any transaction that occurred before the bill becomes law, any loan that was made, will not be subject to the preemption. So we do want to reassure any law enforcement official out there that their rights to go against  people who have been abusive will in no way, up until new loans are made, be in any way diminished.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill>, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007, introduced by my distinguished colleague from North Carolina, Representative Brad Miller. This important legislation will address and reform the mortgage lending processes "to avert a recurrence of the current situation with rising defaults and foreclosures, especially in the sub-prime market."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it is essential that this Congress protects the needs of American families and nothing is more imperative than ensuring that all people have a home. Recent studies have reported that 92 percent of the American population has at some point feared being homeless and this legislation is an important step in alleviating those fears. The current lending crisis must be addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government must play an important role in revitalizing and restoring opportunities for Americans to reach the American dream of owning a home. One of the major contributors of the affordable housing shortage is the sub-prime lending crisis that has caused serious negative economic and social consequences that resulted from too little regulation. Because of the lack of regulation by the Federal Government, many loans were accompanied by fraud, inadequate information and other failures  of responsible marketing. Foreclosure rates</paragraph>
    <paragraph>are at 14 percent and are rising at an alarming rate and homeowners across America are losing their homes. Throughout the country, homeowners are surprised to find out that their monthly payments are spiking and they are struggling to make these increasingly high payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sub-prime mortgage crisis has impacted families and communities across the country. Home foreclosure filings rose to 1.2 million in 2006--a 42 percent jump--due to rising mortgage bills and a slowing housing market. In Iowa, 3,445 families experienced foreclosure last year, up 64 percent from 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nationally, as many as 2.4 million sub-prime borrowers have either lost their homes or could lose them in the next few years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democratic-led House Financial Services Committee has been intently focused on this and other issues and is working toward a balanced solution that helps stabilize the mortgage market, stops abuses, preserves access to credit, and aids stable homeownership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Creating more affordable housing opportunities will increase more job opportunities for the people of Houston and Harris County. We hope that an increase in affordable housing and job opportunities will also reduce the high rates of homelessness among Houston residents. As you may know:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Houston's homeless population increased to approximately 14,000 in 2005 before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hurricane evacuees remaining in the Houston area could result in the homeless population increasing by some 23,000 to 30,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Houston's homeless population includes an estimated 28 percent of American Veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some 59 percent became homeless because of job loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A full 10 percent of the city's homeless are believed to be able to return to self-sufficiency with 12-18 months of assistance and affordable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shelter and housing for Houston's homeless currently is reported at around 4,235 beds and or units, leaving 10,000 on the streets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have cosponsored a number of bills to address the housing crisis in this country. In the 109th Congress I cosponsored H.R.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1182, the Prohibit Predatory Lending Act, and <bill type="h" number="1994">H.R. 1994</bill>, the Predatory Mortgage Lending Reduction Act. I will continue to support legislation to address the housing crisis facing the people of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This important piece of legislation will "create a licensing system for residential mortgage loan originators, establish a minimum standard requiring that borrowers have a reasonable ability to repay a loan, and will attach a limited liability to secondary market securitizers." This is extremely significant in the sense that it will ensure that Americans who dream of home ownership will not engage in loans that they will be unable to repay. It will enhance and expand consumer protections against</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this legislation is a step in the right direction, we must ensure that this legislation does not hurt those who it is intended to protect. We must ensure that families with a less-than-perfect credit history are not denied outright their dream of home-ownership and that lenders do not abuse their discretionary powers. This legislation creates a standard licensing system for residential mortgage loan originators that will ensure a consistent rubric for loans and protect American families  from would-be predatory lenders. It further expands consumer protections from high-cost loans by: prohibiting the financing of points and fees; prohibiting excessive fees for payoff information, modifications, or late payments; prohibiting practices that increase the risk of foreclosure, such as balloon payments,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, let me acknowledge the concerns of strong advacates for the housing needs of the vulnerable--ACORN and the NAACP, among others, and I look to working on changes in this legislation as the bill moves to address their concerns.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill continues the Democratic-led Congress' efforts to protect and promote the American Dream of homeownership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can now see clearly that questionable and even discriminatory lending practices were a part of the real estate "boom" in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district, these unscrupulous practices will result in about a half billion dollar loss in home equity for my constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This translates into over 80,000 homes devalued and the certainty of foreclosure for many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is 80,000 families that entered into their mortgage contracts in good faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They did not anticipate that all of their hard work would be wiped out with one interest rate hike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many nonprofits and other economic development groups in my district, like the Cabrillo Economic Development Center, have stepped up to help these families restructure their loans and keep their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I am happy to say that today the House will do its part to stop harmful predatory lending practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will create minimum standards for mortgage loan originators, and require the determination that a consumer has a reasonable ability to repay their loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Importantly, it also discourages "steering" a consumer toward a higher-cost loan when they in fact qualify for a lower interest rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill and put our families back on track to achieving the American Dream.</paragraph>

    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill> restricts the harmful mortgage lending products that have wreaked havoc on our local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district in Orange County, California, the cities of Anaheim and Santa Ana are feeling the effects of irresponsible lending practices that resulted in numerous foreclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One-third of the homes on the market in those cities are available because they were foreclosed on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Borrowers who will only purchase a home once or twice in their lifetimes should not be blamed for the current situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the licensing of mortgage loan originators, the establishment of loan origination standards, and the enhancement of consumer protections, <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill> takes appropriate steps to stop predatory lending practices without placing an undue burden on responsible mortgage originators and lenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These new standards will provide needed safeguards without preventing potential homebuyers from obtaining loans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill>, The Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007. For the past 8 years I have introduced the Predatory Lending Practices Reduction Act, which seeks to establish a mortgage licensing system for mortgage brokers. It also provides grants to nonprofit community development corporations to educate and train borrowers and community groups regarding illegal and inappropriate predatory lending practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill> incorporates language from my bill that establishes a nationwide mortgage licensing system and registry to license and register individual mortgage brokers, and register bank employees that originate mortgages. I believe that brokers should be prohibited from being the original provider of loans, loan originators, without having first obtained, and continue to maintain, registration within the NMLSR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation has been warranted for a very long time. I have been preaching about this issue since I came to Congress as a member of the Financial Services Committee. We are facing a national housing crisis and without this legislation, the problem will only get much worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The nonprofit Center for Responsible Lending projects that as this year ends, 2.5 million households in the sub-prime market will either have lost their homes to foreclosure or hold sub-prime mortgages that will fail over the next several years. These foreclosures will cost homeowners as much as $164 billion, primarily in lost home equity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Ohio, and particularly in my congressional district, the problem has gone from bad to worse with nearly 42 percent of loans generated in the past year being sub-prime, and an estimated one in six sub-prime loans in the district will ultimately end in foreclosure. These sub-prime foreclosures will result in price declines for more than 198,000 surrounding homes, with homeowners in my district losing about $249 million in equity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Mr. Chairman, I commend Chairman FRANK and the Financial Services Committee on their hard work and commitment to this issue. I am glad to see this bill on the floor today, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this meaningful and necessary legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS ARE WORKING TO PREVENT ANOTHER CRISIS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007. Each month brings new figures that reinforce the importance of putting in place a Federal legislative and regulatory framework that prevents us from reliving this crisis in the mortgage markets. I have a keen interest in this legislation because of the disproportionate impact of the foreclosure wave on my home State. California's third-quarter foreclosure rate of one foreclosure filing for  every 88 households ranked second highest among all States, and reflects a near quadrupling of the number reported for the same period last year. Five of the top 10 metro areas in foreclosure filings are in California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, we need to prevent the now widespread practice of getting people into loans they can't afford. <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill> takes critical steps in this respect, including--for the first time--imposing a Federal duty of care on all mortgage originators and setting minimum Federal standards on all mortgages. Anchoring the bill's approach are newly established minimum standards regarding the borrower's ability to repay and net tangible benefit to the consumer. This is a sound strategy given that Federally  regulated mortgage originators have long had to meet similar benchmarks, and not coincidentally, we have seen few problems in that sector of the market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill> also seeks to reduce the incentives to market inappropriate credit products to borrowers. I am particularly pleased that <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill>--again for the first time--removes the most destructive of such incentives, severing the link between the compensation of the originator and the terms of the loan. Minority borrowers have been disproportionately steered to costly loans, in part because the fees such loans generate for originators are higher than more appropriate products. <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill> correctly  prohibits this practice outright.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to have been an original co-sponsor of this ambitious legislation, and urge my colleagues to support its passage today.  But I would not be telling the truth if I said I lacked any concerns about the potential  impact of our ambition over time. Mr. Chairman, I do want to thank you and Ranking Member BACHUS for your diligent work in the Manager's Amendment to address one such concern I raised during the Financial Services Committee markup of the bill, namely, the extent to which the assignee liability and remedies this bill creates should preempt State law. We want to make sure that consumers are protected to the greatest extent possible--and, historically, many of these protections have been  initiated by States, especially in the sub-prime market. But we also don't want to shut down the secondary mortgage market that has critical to expanding homeownership nationally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the effort that the Manager's Amendment makes to better strike this delicate balance. The Manager's Amendment now clarifies that the bill does not preempt state laws such as fraud and civil rights statutes. In particular, I appreciate that the Manager's Amendment makes crystal clear that securitizers will be held to account when they directly participate in a fraud--as in the egregious First Alliance case I mentioned at Committee markup. However, attorneys who have been working on  predatory lending issues in my district and State for decades, continue to be concerned that the legal meaning of this provision is unclear. As such, federal courts may impart this meaning in ways that roll back important consumer remedies under State law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This, in turn, raises the question of whether we have yet reached the right balance of Federal rights and remedies in the bill, given that we may be displacing a lot of State and private activity in this financial sector. Certainly, national organizations representing consumers remain concerned about this, and many have declined to endorse the bill. As you have noted, Mr. Chairman, that industry groups seem equally ambivalent about the bill suggests that perhaps we are approaching the proper</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To conclude, however, I want to be clear that I believe this groundbreaking bill should be passed today. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to vote for <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill>. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for all of your work on this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of Representative WATT's amendment as a way to strengthen the enforcement provisions of this mortgage bill. Subprime lending has devastated communities throughout Atlanta and my district. Thirty-five percent of all loans made to my constituents are subprime loans--that's much higher than the national average of twenty-eight percent. Seventeen percent of those loans result in foreclosure, which means, in DeKalb County, nearly  1,000 families enter foreclosure each month. In my entire district, it means my constituents who don't lose their homes will still lose nearly $200 million in home equity as foreclosures decrease the values of surrounding homes. Unfortunately, all indicators point to foreclosures continuing to rise well into 2008. These foreclosures have a devastating effect on the families in my district who work hard to buy a house. And they aren't just the result of a downturn in the housing market or because people don't pay their bills on time.

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, today, during the consideration of <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill>, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007 I voted against the Motion to Recommit forthwith. If passed, that motion would have required anyone seeking to get a residential mortgage loan to produce one of four forms of identification prior to approval; a Social Security card and picture ID, a Real ID drivers license, a U.S. or foreign passport or an ID card issued by the Department of Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am opposed to giving illegal immigrants access to mortgages. However, the language contained in the Motion to Recommit forthwith would not only have failed to meet the goal of denying mortgages to illegal immigrants, but it could have actually made it more difficult for legal citizens of New York and other states to obtain these same housing funds. The motion could have made it more difficult for people from states that have not yet adopted Real ID standards or do not have ready access to other  documentation to qualify. However; any illegal immigrant with a passport from their native country would have no difficulty in using that passport to get a mortgage. That is not the kind of requirement we want or need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe it is important that Americans have the opportunity to qualify for mortgages. Owning one's home is a vital part of the American dream. I cannot and will not support legislation that will make it more difficult for citizens and legal immigrants to get mortgages, and easier for illegal immigrants to do so. This motion would have done just that, and as a result I could not support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, which will bring greater transparency to lending practices nationwide. The housing market is under significant stress, and many families cannot keep pace with ballooning mortgage payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unconventional mortgages have left countless Americans facing foreclosure. Unless we act soon, millions more may lose their homes. With this bill, we combat unscrupulous lending practices and bring transparency to the process by requiring mortgage originators to be licensed and mandating full disclosure of loan terms. Perhaps most importantly, mortgage originators must certify that consumers have a reasonable ability to pay back loans and that they are not predatory in nature. We have seen too  many lenders steer consumers into loans they cannot afford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure will address persistent problems in the housing market and bring financial stability to families. I thank Chairman Frank for his leadership, and I urge support for the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the "Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007." Homeowners in Colorado and nationwide continue to face an impending crisis. Millions of borrowers have found themselves with unmanageable loans that not only threaten the financial security of their families and communities, but also undermine the Nation's economy as a whole. Passage of this bill will address irresponsible business practices in the mortgage industry that have  played a part in creating this situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are grave problems in the housing market. Foreclosure rates are rising, housing prices are stagnating and too many Americans are overwhelmed by the rise in their monthly payments. And housing is not the only sector of the economy that has been affected by the tremors whose epicenter is located within the financial institutions involved in mortgage funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill responds to problems that have come to light as those tremors have spread. Its main benefit may be to reduce the likelihood of similar shocks in the future, by reforming mortgage lending practices to soften the impact of rising defaults and foreclosures, especially in the subprime market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill establishes a Federal duty of care for mortgage originators. It prohibits steering consumers to mortgages with predatory characteristics and other abusive practices in the subprime mortgage market, and establishes a licensing and registration system for loan originators. It also expands and enhances consumer protections for "high-cost loans" under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act; requires additional disclosures to consumers, and includes protections for renters of foreclosed  properties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly pleased that this legislation establishes an Office of Housing Counseling within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (RUD). This provision will provide financial and technical assistance to States, local governments, and nonprofit organizations to establish and operate consumer education programs. These programs will both enhance the consumer's financial literacy and also provide people with better information about mortgage and refinancing opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do have some concerns about the bill, particularly regarding the extent to which its preemption provisions could interfere with implementation of State laws regarding loan liability. Fortunately, this risk has been reduced through adoption of an amendment to narrow the preemptive effect of the bill. It is my hope that these provisions can be further reformed in the Senate and conference committee before the bill is sent to the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also concerned about the possible effects of an amendment offered on the House floor that could have created a major new liability for mortgage originators, assignees, and securitizers by establishing a "pattern and practice" violation with penalties of not less than $25,000 per loan and $1 million for the violation itself. As I understand it, the amendment would characterize as a "pattern or practice" as few as two loans, which might mean that a lender who has acted in good faith in  making a loan may be found to have violated this very subjective standard--with massive liability. I found persuasive the argument that  such a potential for increased liability could have a chilling effect in the secondary market, making liquidity less available. Fortunately, this amendment was not adopted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this bill is a good measure that deserves support. Further legislation may be required to address our Nation's mortgage crisis and assist families in Colorado and across the country in restructuring loans and recovering from this financial disaster, but this bill is a necessary part of the response to problem that might have terribly negative impacts on our economic future--and I urge its passage.</paragraph>

First, the bill will establish a Federal duty of care, prohibit steering, and call for licensing and registration of mortgage originators, including brokers and bank loan officers. Second, the new legislation will set a minimum standard for all mortgages which states that borrowers must have a reasonable ability to repay. Third, the legislation attaches limited liability to secondary market  securitizers who package and sell interest in home mortgage loans outside of these standards. However, individual investors in these securities would not be liable. Finally, the bill expands and enhances consumer protections for "high-cost loans" under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act and includes important protections for renters of foreclosed homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passage of <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill> could potentially help hundreds of thousands of homeowners across this Nation who are facing home foreclosures, and need more flexible terms in paying back their mortgages given that we are experiencing increased job layoffs; especially in Detroit and the State of Michigan. According to the Michigan Association of Realtors, the State of Michigan is in deep systematic recession. The auto industry has lost tens of thousands of jobs in the past few years, and there are more  cuts to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, Michigan saw 11,554 new foreclosures filings in February 2007. That put one of every 366 Michigan households at risk of losing a home because of missed mortgage payments. The Wayne County/Detroit area reported 6,653 new foreclosures in January of 2007, more than twice the number reported in December 2007. That amounts to one new filing for every 124 households. <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill> would create a more progressive and equitable home mortgage loan policy that will help scores of working families  across this Nation and Michigan keep their homes; and prevent them from becoming homeless. This legislation will address the ongoing practice of routing unsuspecting borrowers into loans that are not appropriate for their needs and that they can't afford. <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill> will also stop the practice of creative loan financing by unscrupulous brokers who may unnecessarily increase the fees and costs to write the loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson called the housing downtown "the most significant current risk to the U.S. economy." Last week Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the situation will get worse before it gets better. Many believe that faulty mortgage lending practices have precipitated this credit crisis, and that the situation will get worse before it gets better. Therefore, I believe that this legislative remedy is a much needed remedy in a time of crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my friend Chairman BARNEY FRANK and my Republican colleagues for their bipartisan work to create an outstanding piece of legislation that moves us in a proactive direction. In conclusion, let me say that this comprehensive bill brings sweeping and much-needed changes to the mortgage market. It will reform many of the flaws in the current system that has led to the mortgage foreclosure crisis. The American people have asked us to provide the tools and oversight necessary  to address this crisis and we have been able to achieve that goal. I whole heartedly give my complete support to this legislation. It is my belief that this bill reflects the principles of the Democratic Party which historically has ensured that the Federal Government will provide a safety net and protection for working families in a time of need.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS ARE WORKING TO PREVENT ANOTHER CRISIS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill>, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act is a measure response to the ongoing subprime mortgage crisis that sets some minimum Federal standards for home loans and reasonable accountability standards for lenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Setting restrictive standards on borrowers with weak credit profiles and higher risk of default could be counterproductive and limit access to credit to individuals who, without the subprime market, would be unable to get loans and have a part of the American Dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recent increases in subprime borrower foreclosures and lender bankruptcies, however, have prompted concerns that some lenders' underwriting guidelines are too loose and that some borrowers have not fully understood the risks of the mortgage products they chose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To remedy this problem, the bill would require lenders to first document that prospective borrowers can repay both during any discounted introductory period and after the rate rises to market levels. In language that would directly expose lenders to liability, the loans would be required to have a "net tangible benefit" for the borrowers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I agree with the bill's approach, I am concerned about some provisions. For example, I am not certain that prohibiting mortgage brokers from earning yield spread premiums on loans they make to individuals in the subprime market will prevent a great deal of fraud and abuse, and it could lead to mortgage brokers being locked out of this market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is wide agreement, however, that the bill's licensing standards for lenders are needed, and these standards are a primary factor in my support for the legislation. Licensing will lead to more educated lenders, which will in turn lead to borrowers who end up with the most suitable mortgage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, first, this bill makes some substantive changes, including one of the things we came across was the problem of people who were renting who lost their right to live there when there was a foreclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have compromised in this. I have had some conversations; I will have some further ones with the gentleman from Colorado. But we do try to preserve some protection for the renters in the bill. As passed by committee, we had 12 months. This reduces it some to 6 months as the maximum. We will talk more about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond that, there are two things that the manager's amendment clarifies, and I have found from some on the consumer side two objections in this bill, and we deal with these in the manager's amendment and we will deal with them further. One is the issue of preemption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think a certain amount of preemption is essential if we are going to have a secondary market, but it is possible to read the language previously as preempting more than we meant to. What this amendment does is to make very clear that, no matter what the issue is, if the problem was based on fraud or misrepresentation, deception, or false advertising, there is no preemption. The ability of people to go after anything that was based on misrepresentation or fraud is fully preserved, whether or  not it affected their ability to pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, we have--and I am pleased to note that La Raza and the NAACP support this bill--we included at the insistence of the gentleman from North Carolina and the gentleman from California specific language about civil rights violations. No civil rights violation that a State may have would be preempted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have narrowed the preemption. We have made it clear it does not preempt anything growing out of fraud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second issue that has led to some concern, and I am about to yield to my friend from North Carolina (Mr. Miller) has to do with compensation. It was our intention to say that no one who was originating a loan should be given an incentive to put the consumer in a loan that would charge that consumer more than he or she could otherwise get, and we dealt with that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question then came about the way in which brokers are compensated, and we tried to provide two things: One, an absolute prohibition on any incentive to charge people more, but, two, not an interference with the way in which people chose to make those payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We thought we had the language clear. Some people think it isn't clear enough. One of the things we will do is to make that clearer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would yield on this point to the gentleman from North Carolina.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400280" topic="AND INSERT &quot;">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would now like to engage in a colloquy with Mr. Frank concerning this. And, Mr. Chairman, both Mr. Frank and I would deeply appreciate a slow gavel on this particular point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Frank, please direct your attention to the language at the bottom of page 5 of the manager's amendment, clarifying the prohibition against payments to loan originators that vary with the terms of the subprime mortgage, which, as Mr. Murphy of Connecticut has already pointed out, is an important antisteering provision. The abuse that the prohibition addresses is the payment by lenders to originators, most often brokers, known as a yield spread premium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under widespread practice now, lenders pay brokers an additional percentage point in a yield spread premium for every additional half point in interest on the mortgage above the rate that the borrower qualified for. Although borrowers sign a piece of paper agreeing to the payment by the lender, the broker hands the borrower the paper and tells the borrower what the borrower is signing, and most borrowers never realize that the broker makes more money the more that the borrower pays for the mortgage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with Mr. Murphy of Connecticut, that is a kickback. It is not a legitimate business practice. It needs to change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Frank, as I understand it, the clarifying language in the new subparagraph does not simply permit what the previous subparagraph forbids, but it is directed to limited circumstances and does not allow any additional total compensation for an originator. Just as a buyer may pay discount points at closing to buy down the interest rate over the life of the loan, subparagraph (B) allows a consumer to pay more in interest over the life of the loan in return for lower costs and fees at  closing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is that correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="AND INSERT &quot;">
    <paragraph>Yes. That is absolutely what I believe the language says, and it is certainly our intent.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400280" topic="AND INSERT &quot;">
    <paragraph>And is it also correct that any payment by the lender to the broker, or to use the language of the bill, any incentive compensation paid by any person to any originator, based on a higher interest rate, is still forbidden?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="AND INSERT &quot;">
    <paragraph>Yes. I would say, and let me just read the language at the bottom of page 4 of the manager's amendment. Those payments "do not vary based on the terms of the loan or the consumer's decision about whether to finance."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have tried to make it very explicit: Flexibility in method does not in any way reduce the prohibitions that have been stated against an incentive to charge more. And if it is necessary for us to say that again more clearly, as some people may think it is, we will find new ways to say it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield 15 seconds to the chairman of the committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400280" topic="AND INSERT &quot;">
    <paragraph>So a mortgage originator under this subparagraph, the one we were speaking of a moment ago, will get paid exactly the same in total compensation, including both the compensation paid by the borrower and the compensation paid by the lender, whether the interest rate is 6 or 8 or 10. Is that right?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="AND INSERT &quot;">
    <paragraph>Yes. And also, the total cost of the loan has to be the same.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400280" topic="AND INSERT &quot;">
    <paragraph>And so any compensation paid by the lender will be backed out dollar for dollar from what the borrower had agreed to pay; is that correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="AND INSERT &quot;">
    <paragraph>Yes, yes, yes. I feel like I am in Ulysses here.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I am grateful to my friend the ranking member and to the chairman, and I do oppose the manager's amendment and the bill. And I don't think there is any difference of  opinion about the crisis in the mortgage markets in America today. I think the difference is on the impact that this bill will have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem in mortgage markets in America today is that for years we had lenders that were giving teaser rate loans, that were taking no paperwork requirements to prove that borrowers had the ability to buy the home and pay for it. And we had lenders making 100 percent, 110 percent, 120 percent loan-to-value loans. And, obviously, that worked fine when property values were increasing. When property values declined, you have got a crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In essence, what has happened is that we have had this wild galloping horse in the credit markets of mortgages that has gotten loose. Now that horse has gotten very sick. There are none of these loans being made. As a matter of fact, credible buyers with paperwork, with 20 or 30 percent equity, can't get access to mortgage loans today in many instances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are doing for this sick horse is to feed it strychnine. The markets having overreacted, we as Congress are going to pile on and kill the horse with poison. And the difference we have about this bill and this manager's amendment is on the impact it will have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does it help poor people, middle-income people that want to get access to homeownership? No.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And I would submit for the Record an article by Star Parker, who entitles this bill, "How to Limit Homeownership for the Poor."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does this bill help existing homeowners? No, because it will decrease credit availability, which means fewer people will get access to loans. There will be fewer buyers for your home. And the law of supply and demand means that all of our homes will decrease in value because there will be fewer people available to buy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who does this bill help? Well, this bill does help landlords. Very few people will be able to buy homes in the future. Very few people will qualify for the credit. So if you are a landlord, you should be thankful. It helps lawyers. As the Wall Street Journal said, this is the 1-800 Sue Your Banker Act. This is the lawyers and landlords relief act.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>How To Limit Home Ownership for the Poor</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(By Star Parker)</narrative>
  <narrative>The Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007 has passed out of Chairman Barney Frank's House Financial Services Committee. It's now headed to the full House for a vote. In the name of protecting the poor from market predators it will in actuality protect the poor from wealth.</narrative>
  <narrative>This is yet a new chapter in the grand liberal tradition that advances the illusion that government micromanagement of private lives and markets will make us better off. We already have laws against fraud and theft. But for liberals, government isn't there to enforce the law. It's there to run our lives.</narrative>
  <narrative>The legislation assumes that when private individuals make mistakes they can't figure out what they did wrong and make adjustments and that even if they could they wouldn't.</narrative>
  <narrative>We're going to wind up with new and onerous regulations in the business of making loans to consumers for purchasing homes, and as a result, fewer loans will be made and we'll all be worse off. Those who will be penalized the most will be the low-income families who the new regulations will supposedly protect.</narrative>
  <narrative>Should fraud be permitted in our society? No. Should government interfere with private individuals' latitude to determine on their own what risks they wish to take and the willingness of others to finance those risks? Absolutely not.</narrative>
  <narrative>Frank's bill crosses far over the line into regulating private lives and behavior where he and government have no business.</narrative>
  <narrative>Why will this hurt the very low-income families it purports to protect?</narrative>
  <narrative>We already have plenty of experience with the costs of so-called consumer protection laws in general and those designed to regulate mortgage lending in particular.</narrative>
  <narrative>In a recently published article in the Cato Supreme Court Review, Professor Marcus Cole of the Stanford University Law School discusses the fallout of lending laws in Illinois.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Illinois Fairness in Lending Act passed in 2005 gives the state oversight authority on loans made in nine designated zip codes in the state. These zip codes are, of course, areas in which residents are mostly lower-income households.</narrative>
  <narrative>The law places authority in a state bureaucracy to review all applications for mortgages in these designated zip codes. The bureaucrats who review these applications determine if the borrower needs credit counseling and requires the lender to pay for it if required.</narrative>
  <narrative>The costs of the counseling are estimated to be as high as $700 and can delay the processing of the loan up to a month.</narrative>
  <narrative>The borrower has no option to forego this counseling, whose objective is "to protect homebuyers from predatory lending in Cook County's at-risk communities and reduce the incidence of foreclosures."</narrative>
  <narrative>What's the result?</narrative>
  <narrative>Cole reports the following: "Instead of protecting hardworking would-be homeowners from predatory lending, the new law protected them from credit. Within just a few months more than 30 mortgage lenders refused to lend on homes purchased in the targeted zip codes. Those lenders determined to service these communities saw a rise in their costs, which translated into higher interest rates on their loans."</narrative>
  <narrative>The purported cure was worse than the disease. Cole goes on to note that, "home sales in the designated zip codes dropped an average of 45 percent in just one month after the bill took effect. Home prices plummeted, draining relatively poor but hardworking people of what little equity they had in their homes."</narrative>
  <narrative>The experience is similar in other states where governments have authorized bureaucrats to insert themselves between lenders and borrowers. Yes, the number of defaults have declined. They have declined because the number of loans have declined.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Wall Street Journal reports that currently "80 percent of subprime loans are being repaid on time and another 10 percent are only 30 days behind."</narrative>
  <narrative>These are overwhelmingly loans to low-income families. Probably, under Barney Frank's new regulatory regime, many of these loans would not have been made and the families in these homes would be renting and considerably less wealthy than they are today.</narrative>
  <narrative>To quote former Texas Rep. Dick Armey, "freedom works." But it can only work if we let it.</narrative>
  <narrative>Many have paid and are paying a great price for the errors and excesses of recent years. We now should allow private individuals and private markets the opportunity to self correct, which is what will happen.</narrative>
  <narrative>If government steps in to pre-empt the market and Barney Frank is the one to decide who gets loans, the rich will stay rich, the poor will stay poor, and we'll have one more reason for already skeptical Americans to question the American dream.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400010" topic="AND INSERT &quot;">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the bipartisan manager's amendment. It makes both technical and substantive changes in the legislation, and I think significant contributions. For example, the amendment incorporates language authored by the gentleman from California (Mr. Gary G. Miller). His amendment clarifies the bill's anti-steering provisions to ensure that consumers retain the ability to finance points and fees in connection with a mortgage transaction. It also corrects  certain problems in the provisions dealing with renters and foreclosed properties that Mr. Marchant from Texas raised during the markup. And it addresses some of those problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment also includes provisions drafted by the gentlelady from Ohio (Ms. Pryce) that will give consumers regular updates on the term of their mortgages and advance notice of any impending interest rate adjustments. Now, these are important improvements in the bill. And I again thank Chairman Frank and the other members who contributed to the manager's amendment, and urge support for the manager's amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would yield the remaining time that I have to the gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the ranking member for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish this manager's amendment was going to make this a good bill and improve this bill, but it is not making it a good bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a patient that is sick. That is the mortgage market. But what we are doing here is practicing medieval medicine. We are bleeding the patient. We're going to make the patient worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's no argument that we ought to be doing something to improve the subprime and generally the mortgage market in this country as it goes forward, but we should not make it worse. And that's what this will do. And it will make it worse by drying up credit. And that's the biggest problem we have right now. People can't get loans for houses. And this is going to make it ever more difficult because it restricts the amount of loans they can get, and it puts in liability as well.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H14006]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, you know, it won't hurt the person buying a $1 million house with 50 percent down. That person will be fine. Who it's going to hurt is the person out there buying a $200,000 house with $2,500 in cash and a loan from their uncle. But they've got a good job and they think they can get this thing done. But under this bill, banks and lenders are not going to make that loan. And that's the problem with this bill, and that's why this bill should be roundly defeated.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I've long said that predatory lending is a complex problem that requires a comprehensive solution. The adoption of my amendment will make this bill more complete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is based on the Escrow, Appraisal and Mortgage Servicing Improvements Act, <bill type="h" number="3837">H.R. 3837</bill>, which the Financial Services Committee approved last week on a voice vote. In brief, this amendment would improve mortgage servicing, better escrowing practices, and enhance appraiser oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that several Members of both sides of the aisle have joined me to put forward this worthwhile amendment. This proposal also has the support of many outside of this Chamber, including the Appraisal Institute, the National Association of Realtors, the National Association of Mortgage Brokers, and the Center for Responsible Lending, to name a few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there are many components to this proposal, I would like to highlight three of its key provisions. First, it would mandate the establishment of escrows for those borrowers who meet certain tests to protect them from tax liens and costly force placed insurance. We have learned that the subprime borrowers are substantially less likely than prime borrowers to have escrows, even though they are more likely to need help in budgeting for these substantial expenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, the amendment reforms mortgage servicing by mandating swifter response times to consumer inquiries. This change ought to help ensure that those homeowners who need help in the coming months will receive expedited assistance from their mortgage servicers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, the amendment would establish enforceable national appraisal independence standards with sufficient penalties. The appraisal field is one that demands reform, as evidenced by 90 percent of the appraisers reporting pressure to inflate values. Appraisals verify the value of the collateral for the buyer, the seller, the lender, and the investor. Protection from pressure is, therefore, vital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two other issues in this amendment that deserve mention today include the prompt crediting of payments by servicers and providing borrowers with timely access to all appraisals. Going forward, we will work to polish the wording of the former. We will also conform the language of the latter to the existing standards of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In sum, Mr. Chairman, my amendment should be part of the legislative response to improve lending practices and enhance accountability. I encourage every one of my colleagues to support this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to echo the remarks of Mr. Kanjorski and thank him and my colleagues, Mr. Hodes, Mrs. Capito and Ms. Moore, for working on this amendment, which is based on <bill type="h" number="3837">H.R. 3837</bill>, the Escrow, Appraisal and Mortgage Servicing Improvements Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Overall, this amendment addresses deceptive, abusive and fraudulent mortgage lending practices related to titles on escrow accounts, mortgage servicing and appraisals. We worked hard following our markup last week to clean up language in this amendment regarding the prompt crediting of payments and Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, commonly known as RESPA, liability, in addition to making several more technical changes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have more to do, especially further developing the language in the payments and escrow sections in this bill; but I'm confident that, based on the bipartisan progress that we've made this far, we can work out our differences as the bill continues to move through the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank Mr. Kanjorski and my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for their hard work and cooperation on this amendment. It has broad bipartisan support, and I urge my colleagues to vote for it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank Representative Kanjorski, the chairman of the Capital Markets Subcommittee, for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that this amendment is a good complement to Chairman Frank's antipredatory lending bill, and I commend colleagues on both sides of the  aisle for the bipartisan nature of this amendment, which is similar to <bill type="h" number="3837">H.R. 3837</bill>, the bill of which I was a proud cosponsor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of my constituents have had problems with their mortgage servicers. This amendment makes sure that servicers provide faster responses to consumer inquiries and provides increased penalties for abusive servicing practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Escrows help homeowners pay their property taxes on time, but many homeowners are unaware of the total cost of the loan because the exact amount of taxes and insurance isn't disclosed at the time of closing. This amendment would make sure that homeowners are informed of the actual amount of the loan, including the escrow payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And also, lastly, faulty appraisals have been a huge problem and can have a devastating impact on a family's single largest investment, their home. If the initial appraisal is inaccurate, reselling the home for what the family paid can be nearly impossible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment creates a Federal independent standard for appraisals enforced by tough penalties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400661" topic="TITLE VI--MORTGAGE SERVICING">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I'll be brief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that with Mr. Frank's bill, we can see that these exotic products have created a crisis in the mortgage industry. But as Attorney General Cuomo from New York said, any real estate scam, at the very base and root of it, is a faulty and a bad appraisal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very commonsense regulation, and I congratulate Mr. Kanjorski and my other co-authors for bringing this forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is about putting the interests of homebuyers first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Buying a home is daunting enough without having to worry that the people that supposedly work for you aren't on your side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The safeguards in this amendment--the independence standards for appraisers and provisions that strengthen Federal oversight of the appraisal process will assure homebuyers that the home they are purchasing hasn't been inflated in "perceived" value by an unscrupulous appraiser.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A bad appraisal can also make it impossible for a subprime borrower to refinance--what happens when they try to get into a prime loan and a responsible bank wants a responsible appraisal done? That's when the other shoe drops and the homeowner finds out they've been duped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These safeguards would protect consumers, but would also benefit the secondary market and our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When a mortgage is sold on the secondary market, investors need to know that the securities they hold are backed up by a home that has been appraised accurately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, the amendment's requirements that subprime and other at-risk borrowers receive an escrow account will protect those borrowers from huge end-of-the-year tax bills and will reduce foreclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the Kanjorski-Biggert-Capito-Hodes-Moore amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kanjorski). The amendment, among other things, enhances the integrity of the appraisal process, and requires the taxes and insurance on subprime mortgages be escrowed. These are two glaring problems in today's subprime market, and I think both these requirements will go a long way towards making these loans sounder and reducing the number of foreclosures and  delinquencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These issues are ones that the gentleman from Pennsylvania has worked on for many years. He deserves credit for an amendment that will improve many key aspects of the mortgage origination, servicing, and appraisal process; and I compliment him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Kanjorski worked closely with my colleagues, Ranking Members JUDY BIGGERT and SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO, in crafting the amendment. And the three of them actually offered the amendment that addresses legitimate administrative and operational concerns that have been raised, not only by consumer groups, but by the industry itself. And the mortgage appraisers, or the Appraisers Institute, actually endorsed this measure. And it maintains the underlying bill's strong consumer  protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And this amendment offers additional strong protections.</paragraph>
