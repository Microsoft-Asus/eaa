    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 443, recognizing the service of the 65th Infantry Borinqueneers during the Korean War, honoring the people of Puerto Rico who continue to serve and volunteer for services in the Armed Forces and make sacrifices for this country, and commending all efforts to promote and preserve the history of the 65 Infantry Borinqueneers. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for bringing this measure before the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1908 the United States Congress directed that a unit be established and comprised primarily of individuals from Puerto Rico, which was then renamed in 1920 as the 65th Infantry Regiment. Our brothers and sisters of the 65th Infantry Borinqueneers fought valiantly and gave their lives during the Korean War and the two World Wars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1917 the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has been a part of the United States and home to almost 4 million U.S. citizens. During the Korean War, Puerto Rico lost a disproportionate number of servicemembers relative to the population of the island as a whole. Eight soldiers of the 65th Infantry Regiment received the Distinguished Service Cross, and 129 were awarded the Silver Star for their heroism during the Korean conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Resolution 443 highlights an important group of servicemembers who have helped forge the foundation of the freedoms that we enjoy today. The 65th Infantry Borinqueneers are to be recognized for their tremendous sacrifice. We should not forget those who are serving today in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Puerto Rico and all Americans can be proud of the tremendous contributions these men have made to the defense of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 443.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I do rise in support of House Resolution 443, which recognizes the service of the 65th Infantry Regiment, Puerto Rico National Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Mr. Speaker, the First Battalion, 65th Infantry Regiment, Puerto Rico National Guard, continues a tradition of outstanding service in the Army established by members of that regiment in World War I, World War II, and in Korea. Their motto, "Honor and Fidelity," summarizes that service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in Korea, as an active Army unit, the regiment fought with particular distinction, participating in nine major campaigns from 1950 until 1953. For its actions, the unit was awarded two Presidential Unit Citations, a Meritorious Unit Commendation, and two Republic of Korea Unit Citations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Such outstanding service led General Douglas MacArthur to say: "The Puerto Ricans of the gallant 65th Infantry on the battlefields of Korea are writing a brilliant record of achievement in battle, and I am proud indeed to have them in this command. I wish that I had many more like them."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In achieving such recognition for their competence and valor, the men of the 65th Infantry suffered heavy casualties and numerous vicious battles against determined North Korean and Chinese units. Moreover, the men of the 65th not only had to overcome severe weather and terrain and shortages of clothing and equipment, but also the elements of prejudice and unfavorable bias that they encountered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, given the history of outstanding service by the 65th since its inception back in 1898, as well as the continuing commitment and dedication shown by the current members of this unit, it is fitting that we take the time today to recognize and to honor that service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge all Members to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the sponsor of this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400263" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from New Hampshire for her remarks and for yielding me the time and for her leadership on the Armed Services Committee. I also want to thank my good friend from Georgia for his words in support of this resolution, House Resolution 443, which pays tribute to the 65th Infantry Borinqueneers and to the men and women of Puerto Rico who continue to serve our country with honor and distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will insert into the Record a letter from Anibal Acevedo Vila, the Governor of Puerto Rico, endorsing this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>July 18, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CONGRESSMAN MCGOVERN: Thank you for your efforts to recognize the service of Puerto Ricans in the armed forces of the United States, and in particular, the 65th Infantry Borinquineers, by introducing <bill type="hr" number="443">H. Res. 443</bill>. Puerto Ricans have served with great distinction in the military, and I appreciate your efforts to highlight their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 65th Infantry Borinquineers were founded as an all-Puerto Rican regiment in 1899, and served in World War I, World War II, and in the Korean War. It was in this last campaign that the 65th Infantry earned their renown, leading General Douglas MacArthur to remark: "[t]he Puerto Ricans forming the ranks of the gallant 65th Infantry ..... are writing a brilliant record of achievement in battle and I am proud indeed to have them in this command. I wish that we might have many more like them."  During the Korean War, members of the 65th Infantry were awarded 10 Distinguished Service Crosses, 256 Silver Stars, and 606 Bronze Stars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As <bill type="hr" number="443">H. Res. 443</bill> acknowledges, Puerto Ricans have a tradition of dedicated and honorable service in the armed forces of the United States. Military units from Puerto Rico were among the first to deploy following the attacks of September 11, 2001, and over 7,000 members of our National Guard have since been deployed in support of current operations. Over 55 soldiers, sailors and airmen of Puerto Rican descent have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. There are over 144,000 veterans living in  Puerto Rico, and four sons of the Island have earned the Medal of Honor since Vietnam, the second highest per capita of any jurisdiction in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Puerto Rican soldiers in the armed forces today continue the tradition of the 65th Infantry by serving with honor and distinction and make all Puerto Ricans proud of their service. Once again, I appreciate your introduction of <bill type="hr" number="443">H. Res. 443</bill> to recognize and commend those Puerto Ricans who have served  in the past and present in our nation's armed forces, and I look forward to the resolution's adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Anibal Acevedo Vil&#xE1;,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it has been a privilege to learn about the proud service of the 65th Infantry Borinqueneers, the only Hispanic-segregated unit in the United States Military history. The first native Puerto Rican troops were approved by Congress in 1899, designated as the Puerto Rican Regiment U.S. Volunteers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The regiment was ordered to war strength in 1917 and served in defense of the Panama Canal during World War I. On June 4, 1920, the regiment was officially re-designated as the 65th Infantry, U.S. Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After serving ably in France and Germany during World War II, the 65th was ordered to Korea in 1950. It was during the Korean War where the 65th Infantry invoked the name Borinqueneers, and it is also where they demonstrated their military prowess.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The name Borinqueneers comes from the word Borinquen, which is the original native Taino Indians of the island we now call Puerto Rico. Many members were direct descendants of these native people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Borinqueneers fought on the front lines in Korea, participating in nine major campaigns throughout the war. They were the protection force for marines withdrawing from far inland positions. They were the leading unit in the United Nations offensive of April 1951. In every campaign they performed as one of the most effective infantry regiments in the Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earning the respect and admiration of fellow soldiers and military leaders, General Douglas MacArthur himself remarked, "They showed magnificent ability and courage in field operations," and "they are a credit to Puerto Rico, and I am proud to have them in my command."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is of the utmost importance that we recognize the valiant service of the Borinqueneers and that we recognize the sacrifices made by the people of Puerto Rico during the Korean War: 61,000 Puerto Ricans served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, the overwhelming majority in the 65th Infantry Regiment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the end of the war, 743 Puerto Ricans were killed, and over 2,300 wounded. One of every 42 casualties suffered by U.S. forces in Korea was Puerto Rican. Puerto Rico endured one casualty for every 660 of its inhabitants, a disproportionately heavy burden for the small island. This statistic highlights the enormous sacrifice by Puerto Rico, and it gives testament to the honor and distinction of their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would also like to note some current efforts to promote and preserve the history of the 65th Infantry Borinqueneers. In my district, the Korean War Memorial of Central Massachusetts Committee, along with Colonel Gilbert Villahermosa, Inspector General of the Massachusetts Army National Guard, and the Puerto Rican community of central Massachusetts are working together to commemorate the 65th Infantry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The efforts have included promotion of the documentary film "The Borinqueneers," construction of a memorial flagpole, and Colonel Villahermosa himself has released a book detailing the critical role which the 65th Infantry played in Korea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to have introduced this bill with the Representative from Puerto Rico (Mr. Fortu&#xF1;o), and I would also like to thank Chairman Skelton and all members of the Armed Services Committee who supported its consideration on the suspension calendar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to thank my two colleagues, the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Shea-Porter) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey), for their words here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to pass House Resolution 443.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. Before yielding back, I would like to encourage all of our colleagues, both sides of the aisle, and I am sure we will have a unanimous vote on H.Res 443. I thank the gentlewoman from New Hampshire for allowing me to control the time on this side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. FORTU&#xD1;O. Mr. Speaker, during this month, our country proudly celebrates Hispanic Heritage Month. In the midst of this celebration, it is with great honor and pride that I stand in support of <bill type="hr" number="443">H. Res. 443</bill> which seeks to recognize the service of the 65th infantry regiment during the Korean War known as the Borinqueneers Regiment. I also want to thank Congressman MCGOVERN for his leadership in honoring these brave soldiers. At a time when there is a national dialogue on the contributions  of Hispanic Americans, there is no better way to recognize their achievements, than by voting for <bill type="hr" number="443">H. Res. 443</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that since the Civil War, where over 10,000 Hispanic Americans wore uniforms for both sides, the number of soldiers of Hispanic heritage that have served in each conflict has been significant. Their participation in every military conflict is a source of many heroic actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In World War I, 200,000 Hispanics were mobilized and to this day we hear stories of their valor, and devotion to spread democracy and freedom around the World.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Roughly half a million Hispanics served during World War II. They fought bravely in all of the major conflicts extending throughout Europe, the Pacific and Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it is during the Korean War that over 148,000 Hispanics served, of which 20,000 were from my district in Puerto Rico. 4,000 of them comprised the 65th Infantry Regiment, the largest U.S. infantry regiment for that war. This regiment fought in every major campaign of the Korean War and received numerous praises including a Presidential Unit Citation, Meritorious Unit Commendations and two Republic of Korea Unit Citations for their performance. I would like to quote General Douglas MacArthur,  who said in Tokyo on February 12, 1951: "The Puerto Ricans forming the ranks of the gallant 65th Infantry on the battlefields of Korea ..... are writing a brilliant record of achievement in battle and I am proud indeed to have them in this command. I wish that we might have many more like them."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is due to this ever-growing identity in the United States, that Hispanic Americans continue to wear, with honor, the uniforms of our Armed Forces. This legislation honors the 65th Infantry Borinqueneers and the legacy they left behind; a legacy of valor, courage and self-sacrifice in the face of adversity. I am proud to be an American of Hispanic descent and equally proud to represent the members of the 65th Infantry Regiment; it is for them that I stand here today in support of this legislation  and urge all my colleagues to unanimously vote in favor of <bill type="hr" number="443">H. Res. 443</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
