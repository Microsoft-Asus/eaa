  <narrative>HONORING BEN CRENSHAW -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2134]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412252" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today I rise to honor and pay tribute to an exceptional athlete and distinguished American, Ben Crenshaw.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Architect, historian, gentleman, all of these words correctly portray Ben Daniel Crenshaw. But perhaps the most fitting description for this great golfer is champion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Augusta, Georgia, who I represent, and golf fans around the world recognize Ben Crenshaw as one of the finest, most talented golfers on the PGA circuit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Crenshaw has been a phenomenon on the golf course since childhood, winning his first tournament, the Casis Elementary Open, in the fourth grade. He continued to play through middle school and high school, claiming several championship titles. It was clear then that Ben Crenshaw was on his way to greatness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He made school history during the 1970-71 academic year at the University of Texas when Crenshaw became the first freshman to capture the individual title during the NCAA tournament at the Tuscan National Golf Club. His outstanding accomplishments and victories that year earned Crenshaw the privilege to be named to the 1971 All American collegiate golf team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Crenshaw's early achievement set the stage for an extraordinary career. His most notable achievements include being a 19-time winner on the PGA tour, captain of the 1999 U.S. Ryder Cup team whose stunning comeback is remembered as one of the most exciting competitions in that match's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And he's also a two-time Masters champion. Many will never forget the emotional scene that played out on the 18th green when, in 1995, Crenshaw clinched his second Masters victory and earned yet another green jacket.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to these accomplishments, he has been a tremendous ambassador for the game of golf, as well as a consummate gentleman and human being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the privilege of being in Augusta on April 7, 2008 before the 72nd Master's Tournament as Mayor Deke Copenhaver awarded Crenshaw a crystal "key to the city." It is an honor for me to pay tribute to a great American golf legend, Ben Crenshaw.</paragraph>
