    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the bill before us has been passed before, and they call it the HEART bill, Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008. I would prefer to call it the "Thank You" bill. Thank you for the tens of thousands of American men and women who have come to America's call to fight this war and to place themselves at risk because our Commander in Chief and our Nation have called them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very difficult for me to think of any people that we should be saying "thank you" more to than this group, who are not Democrats and Republicans, are not politicians, but people whom America has depended on since its very beginning, and, that is, people who are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice because their country asked them to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have recently passed a bill which is the equivalent, if not expanded, the GI Bill, so that those that do get back, many of them without limbs, many of them without jobs, would be able to get a decent education. This kind of enhances the ability for them to get their pensions, to get homes, and to remove the impediments that these brave people deserve. And one of the things that we're proudest of is that we have removed some type of impediment that will allow our fighting soldiers to be able  to get the benefits of some of our tax laws even though they have married immigrants. So it is something that I am certain that everyone in this House and most all Americans would be supporting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What a great honor it is for me to yield the balance of my time in support of this bill to Admiral Joe Sestak from the Seventh District of Pennsylvania. It's so easy for all of us to talk about sacrifices and so seldom that we find someone who has dedicated 31 years of his very young life for the defense of this great Nation of ours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has been the commander of an aircraft carrier of 30 U.S. and allied ships, over 15,000 sailors, 100 aircrafts; and this is only part of what the three-star Admiral in the United States Navy has done. How lucky we are in this Nation and, more specifically, in this Congress to have this distinguished Member speak in support of this bill, one who probably knows more about the needs of our service people than most of us ever hope to find out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with the Speaker's permission and unanimous consent of this body, I ask you to allow me to yield the balance of my time for purposes of picking other speakers to Congressman/Representative/Admiral Joe Sestak of the Seventh District of Pennsylvania.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="6081">H.R. 6081</bill>, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, first I want to commend the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel, for bringing this bill to the floor today. It's certainly a bill that has bipartisan support, bicameral support, and I will talk a little bit more about that in my remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People watching this on C-SPAN may think they have gone into reruns. We haven't. This bill has been discussed on the floor of the House before and, in fact, passed through the House before. Unfortunately, though, we never could get the Senate version and the House version reconciled and get a bill to the President. So here we are again starting this process in the House, passing a bill today, hoping to get finally some agreement so that we can get this bill to the President and we can give some  relief to our soldiers in the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides certain tax benefits to members of the military. It provides tax credits to housing projects for low-income families. But the specific thing that it fixes is, with respect to low-income housing and the eligibility for that, when testing to see if a family's income makes them eligible, current law excludes the value of a section 8 voucher provided by HUD. But a family's income does include the value of a base housing allowance provided to members of the Armed Forces. This bill,  for whatever reason, doesn't address this issue. In the past other versions of this legislation have. Congressman Moran of Kansas and Senator Roberts of Kansas have tried to address this problem in legislation, and the other body has included it. And that's one of the things that led to last year's deadlock. I personally wish that this provision were included, and I hope before the end of the process, we can address that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there are many good things in the bill before the House today, including provisions to ensure that combat pay does not diminish the earned income credit. The bill also contains important language allowing active-duty Reservists to make penalty-free withdrawals from retirement plans and permits contributions of military death benefit gratuities into a Roth IRA or education savings account without regard to annual contribution limits. Other provisions in the bill amend the Supplemental Security  Income program to expand eligibility for, and increase SSI benefit payments to, certain military families, veterans, and AmeriCorps participants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does contain one other change from the bill debated last year that merits mentioning today. It allows stimulus checks to be mailed to families in which one spouse is a member of the military and the other does not have a valid Social Security number. I understand the reasons for this provision, and I'm sure as this bill works its way through the process, we will have an opportunity to examine this provision further to make sure that it's administrable and workable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, one other provision deserves particular mention both because of its merits and because it's a great example of how one person's good idea brought to the attention of a Member of Congress can make its way to the forefront of a legislative agenda. Health care flexible spending accounts, known as FSAs, have a use-it-or-lose-it rule. If you don't use all the money by the end of the year, the money goes back to your employer. Funds deposited into an FSA are put there on a pretax basis, or  a tax-free basis. So it's a very attractive benefit for employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill modifies the FSA program to allow a plan to return deposited funds to an employee at the end of the year if that amount remains unspent because the individual was called to active-duty military service. This is a very, I think, fair change to the underlying program. It's an issue that one of Mr. Barton's, Joe Barton's, constituents raised with him, and I applaud  him and his lead cosponsor, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the brave men and women who are in harm's way right now serving and defending America should not be subjected to unfair taxes or barriers to assistance. But that is exactly what is happening today, and this legislation will change that for members of the military and others serving our Nation, for instance, in AmeriCorps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ways and Means Chairman Charlie Rangel recognized the burden being placed on our heroes and included provisions that will alter over a dozen tax provisions and remove barriers to other benefit programs for military families. It's the least we can do for those who do so much for us. The chairman, a veteran, and I, also a veteran, are proud to bring legislation to the floor that demonstrates the House fully and fairly supports our soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For instance, there are provisions in the legislation that improve how the Supplemental Security Income, or SSI program, treats military families, veterans, and those who have served our country. Under current law, some military families lose part of their SSI benefits because a portion of their compensation is counted as unearned income. This bill would stop that unfair treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congressional Budget Office estimates this change alone would affect about 3,000 military families with disabled children. In addition to helping military families, the legislation would ensure that AmeriCorps volunteers do not unfairly lose their SSI benefits. More specifically, the bill would prevent allowances provided to AmeriCorps participants from reducing SSI benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the tax side, the chairman included an initiative that Mr. Van Hollen and I proposed that would remove an obstacle for some Americans who serve in the Peace Corps. This provision ensures that overseas service by Peace Corps volunteers does not arbitrarily remove the exclusion for capital gains tax on a principal residence. This protection is similar to one already provided to Americans working for the Foreign Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, all of these provisions aim to ensure that service to our Nation does not disadvantage those who serve.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Because the legislation deals with arcane areas like the Tax Code, this may not sound exciting, but it's very important. This legislation tells our soldiers in word and deed that we thank them for their service and we are watching out for them, just as they are watching out for us. This small measure of fairness deserves every Member's support.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>At this time I yield 2 minutes to the gentlelady from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I too am here to support <bill type="h" number="6081">H.R. 6081</bill>, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act, and I think that it is very, very important that we look for every way possible to give relief to our folks who are serving in the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to say that 2 years ago, the President signed into law a bill that I call the HERO Act, which allowed folks who earned combat pay to use that pay to go into taking out an IRA. Again, the idea came from an average citizen who notified our office of a concern because his son had tried to invest his combat pay into an IRA, looking to prepare for his future. We were able to get that bill passed through the Ways and Means Committee 2 years ago, and that bill went through a similar experience  that this bill is going through, having passed, then meeting problems in the Senate, then having to pass again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think this bill contains so many elements that will advantage people who are willing to serve in the military, and as Chairman Rangel has said, these are the people who have kept us free from the beginning of this country, and I think that anything that we can do to help them, we need to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also recommend that we do something to lower our gas prices, which will help their families who are staying here in this country while they may be overseas fighting for our freedom to deal with the rising cost of gas problems. I call on the Democrat majority to come up with their commonsense plan that they have said that they had to help us lower gas prices, not just for our military, but for all Americans.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412232" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I joined up in the military during the Vietnam conflict, and at that time, and still today, we don't have human resource departments in the U.S. military. You tend, as a young division officer, to take care of the challenges that your young men and women have, and their families yourself, whether it's an eviction notice or whether it's a health issue, or whether it is, as thousands at that time and through the eighties used to have to go out and get their food stamps in order to  continue their quality of life, you took care of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill takes a significant step, I believe. As Mr. Rangel insinuated, it's a small step, but it is a significant step. I say that because the most moving picture I have ever seen in the Pentagon is one that is across from the Secretary of Defense's office. It's of a young servicemember kneeling in church and alongside of him is his wife and a young child. And under it is this great saying from the Bible, where God turns to Isaiah and says, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for  us?" and Isaiah replies, "Here am I. Send me."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We send them, and we need to welcome them when they come back. The commissary bags also used to have on them, "The hardest job in the military is a military spouse." What this bill does is takes care of the cost of life. But it also is significant that it takes care of the cost of loss of life. Because what distinguishes this profession from anyone else's is that it has the dignity of danger about it, where the loss of life may occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So in this bill it ensures if an employer still wants to, even after a death of a servicemember, contribute to his retirement plan, he can. It also then permits the spouse, having lost a servicemember, can actually then place this military gratuity benefit into an IRA without any penalty. It does much for our servicemembers; that lets them take combat pay, for example, and place it towards earned income so that they can move into the middle class as an earned income tax credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my mind, this is an excellent bill that has come out, and it has bipartisan agreement. But the reason I think this is so important today is that our servicemembers returning from overseas, 19 percent of them have post-traumatic stress disorder, 33 percent of them have a mental challenge, from depression to anxiety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This war is different. In World War II, the average soldier went into battle 182 days. He had time to rest in between major battles to get his nerves back in shape. Our soldiers in Iraq go  outside the wire every day for 15 straight months into a combat-like situation. They are a strong generation, but this war is different.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So therefore as we keep that in mind for those who say, Here am I, send me, we should also keep in mind that what we are doing here is when the great warriors Jonathan and David departed for the last time in the Bible, Jonathan turned to David and said, Tomorrow there shall be a new moon and thou shall be missed because thy seat shall be empty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This seat should never be empty. It should be filled with a legacy of what they have done for this Nation. This bill, in my mind, takes a step, a small but significant step to remembering that these men and women who have served this Nation should continue to be welcomed home by us with a legacy of thanks that this bill does.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill on the floor today that will provide additional tax relief to our Nation's veterans, especially those who are seeking to purchase homes. This bill ensures that our veterans who serve their Nation after 1977, including those who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, can qualify for low-interest home loans financed by Qualified Veterans Mortgage Bonds. In Texas, this is important. This bill will enable the Texas Veterans Land Board, led by Commissioner  Jerry Patterson, to expand its existing low-interest loan program to serve thousands of more Texas veterans.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400120" topic="">
    <paragraph>About a week ago, this Congress passed the most comprehensive update of the GI Bill of Rights for both Active Duty, Guard and Reserve soldiers. We follow up that legislation with what we are doing today to also update our laws as relates to active duty soldiers and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, as my colleague from the Philadelphia area said, this war is different. We have noted the difference. We need to adjust our policy and our legislation and our laws to the fact that this war has gone on longer than anybody predicted, cost more in lives, treasure, and reputation than any war in America's past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today we take another small step to change our laws to reflect this different kind of war to make sure those soldiers and their families are represented in the laws we pass today. Now many will talk about some of the benefits, and they should. I want to talk about one particular provision that I put in here with my colleague from Indiana, who you will hear from later, Congressman Ellsworth, about how we pay for this, because it doesn't add one penny to the deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It closes down a tax loophole used by KBR, a company, that it set up offshore in the Cayman Islands a subsidiary, and it never paid Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes, unemployment insurance taxes to 10,000 workers. Never paid any of those taxes on any of those employees. This legislation shuts that down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those employees were over there. And what happened? This company gave contaminated water to our soldiers, who ended up, many of them, in the hospital getting health care by the basic facilities we have over in Iraq. Our soldiers got contaminated water, our taxpayers got ripped off because they had to cover for another company what they didn't pay in their fair share, and a company was set up offshore to do all of that.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>It's ironic that it took 4 years to close this offshore loophole. But we are shutting it down and paying for all these other benefits to ensure that this company and other companies like it who set up in the Cayman Islands do not go around the law of the United States to come in under budget, knowing the fact they never paid their fair share of taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a small step. It also is an indication we need to start changing the law because there is over 12,000 companies in the Cayman Islands alone set up over there, avoiding their fair share of taxes while the American taxpayers have to pay their portion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am pleased that we are doing this, giving the benefits to the GIs and their families, but, most importantly, closing down an egregious loophole to do that.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for yielding me his time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am here to commend the Ways and Mean Committee's efforts to make the Tax Code more equitable to our servicemembers. However, once again, I am on the floor to express my disappointment that the bill does not include an important provision providing more affordable housing opportunities for our servicemembers and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This fix to the Tax Code that is missing from this legislation would prevent lower income military personnel from being discriminated against when applying for affordable housing built under the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program. There is a strong need for the tax bill that we are considering today, but the Senate will not approve it without this additional provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A number of military installations across the country are experiencing housing shortages as a result of the 2005 BRAC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Fort Riley, an Army post located in the State of Kansas, is nearly doubling its size with an influx of 30,000 soldiers, family members and civilian workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When these new soldiers live outside the fort, they receive a military housing allowance for the use in paying rent. Though the Tax Code does not treat this housing allowance as taxable income, it is considered income when determining a military family's eligibility to live in facilities financed by low-income housing tax credits. The result is that many servicemembers, particularly our enlisted ones, are considered to earn too much income and thus are disqualified from accessing this affordable  housing program. However, comparative low-income civilians receiving section 8 housing vouchers are more likely to qualify for this same housing. This is because, unlike the military housing subsidy, the Tax Code exempts section 8 assistance from being considered income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's military families deserve access to safe, decent, affordable housing, and they should be given a fair opportunity to qualify for it. Last December the Senate acted to fix this inequality, and the Senate included in their version of this legislation a provision exempting military housing allowance from income eligibility requirements when qualifying for affordable housing.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Under this Senate provision, the Governor of each State would be allowed to make this exemption if he or she determines that it is needed for a certain military installation within that State. This Senate provision is patterned after USDA's WIC nutrition programs for women, children and infants, and provides State agencies a similar option for WIC eligibility. Unfortunately, the House majority's refusal to include this provision has stalled this important tax legislation  from moving forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The men and women serving our Nation are waiting for us to act, and I hope that the changes made by the Senate, which narrow the scope of the provision, will address many of the majority's concerns and a compromise can be reached. Until then, military families who are applying to live in affordable housing continue to encounter this discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I will vote for <bill type="h" number="6081">H.R. 6081</bill>, our military men and women deserve a better shot at affordable housing.</paragraph>

This important legislation will provide well-deserved tax benefits to assist our military personnel and their families, our veterans, and a group that doesn't get nearly enough credit across our Nation, the volunteer firefighters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to for just a minute pick up on what Congressman Emanuel said a few minutes ago and discuss one of the offsets used to pay for this tax relief for American heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been reported that recently some government contractors are using offshore tax havens to avoid paying the payroll taxes that they owe our government. We introduced the Fair Share Act to put a stop to this abuse, and as a Blue Dog and a believer in pay-as-you-go budgeting, I am proud to have that legislation included as part of this important bill today. It will end the practice of government contractors setting up shell companies in the Cayman Islands to avoid paying into the Social Security  and Medicare payroll taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people back home in Indiana play by the rules and pay their taxes. I don't think it is too much to ask our government contractors to do the same. They are receiving millions of dollars, sometimes billions in tax dollars, and I think it is time they do the same thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I urge my colleagues to support this bill and send a strong message from the Congress that it is not going to stand by and let contractors cheat the workers, cheat the government and cheat the American taxpayers.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my friend and colleague from the great State of Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last fall I introduced the Active Duty Military Tax Relief Act to assist our brave men and women in uniform who are serving our country with honor and distinction, and I am pleased that significant provisions proposed in my bill are incorporated in their entirety into the bill we are discussing today, the bipartisan HEART Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Servicemembers are often confronted with transitional issues when called to duty, and the bill we are debating today includes provisions from my bill making essential tax relief for our military families permanent by providing incentives to ensure that Reservists who are called up for active duty do not suffer a pay cut. This bill also makes it easier for veterans to become homeowners, and it includes other provisions from my bill allowing recipients of the military death benefit gratuities  to make contributions of up to $100,000 into tax-favored accounts, such as Roth IRAs and Education Savings Accounts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we spend a lot of time in this Congress talking about supporting our troops, and we are providing further evidence today that we are going to support our troops with our actions and not just our words. The HEART Act is another sign of our commitment to our Nation's heroes, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400097" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Rangel and my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee for including provisions from <bill type="h" number="337">H.R. 337</bill> and <bill type="h" number="515">H.R. 515</bill> in the HEART Act. Including these two bills is particularly meaningful for me because both were inspired by servicemembers and veterans in my district who came to me and said we have problems needing your attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first bill addresses a harmful glitch in the Supplemental Security Income program. Because eligibility for SSI benefits is based on income, a family struggling to get by actually loses benefits for their children from any increase in military pay considered "unearned income." Military families do not deserve to lose the benefits they badly need because a parent chooses to serve in the Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second bill fixes a serious flaw in the CalVet Home Loan program limiting eligibility to servicemembers who signed up prior to 1977. This prevents many veterans from the first Gulf War and nearly all veterans from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from taking advantage of the CalVet program. <bill type="h" number="6081">H.R. 6081</bill> removes the date of service provision, giving servicemembers retiring in California a greater opportunity to own a home.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, before yielding back my time, I want to rise in support of <bill type="h" number="6081">H.R. 6081</bill>, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008. I particularly want to point out that this product that is before us today is bipartisan. It is clear that both Republicans and Democrats want to ensure that our men and women in uniform, those who stand and every day place their lives at risk to defend our freedoms and the values that our Nation represents, that we provide help  for them and their families. I commend Chairman Rangel and ranking member Mr. McCrery for their leadership in putting together this bipartisan bill that helps our military and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge a bipartisan "aye" vote.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When General Akhromeyev came from the Soviet Union to visit the United States when the Soviet Union was breaking up, Admiral Crowe took him to many places, including an aircraft carrier. When he departed the aircraft carrier, he was asked by Admiral Crowe, Chairman of Our Joint Chiefs of Staff, "What most impressed you?" He turned to him and looked him in the eye and said, "Your enlisted man."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is why General Washington, when he established the very first ribbon in the United States Army, a piece of purple ribbon which is today's Purple Heart, dictated that that award would only be given to enlisted men. The enlisted servicemembers are the heart of our military, and this bill is focused upon them. They are the ones who say, "Here am I. Send me."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend both sides of the aisle for recognizing who most deserves being remembered for the sacrifice to this Nation. It is the enlisted man and woman.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, we may each have our own convictions about this war, and no matter what those may be, I think I can safely say that we stand united in our support for our troops and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one here today can challenge the commitment, the dedication, or the bravery of our men and women who have responded to this national call.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have made sacrifices that very few Americans have ever been called on to make--many have paid with their lives, and many others with the loss of limbs and mental injuries we will never be able to comprehend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know the great value of education benefits for our military. I wil1. continue to fight for an increase that exceeds what our President has requested in GI education benefits and in military pay for our sons and daughters who serve in the military. Our men and women need it and they have earned every bit of it, and more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill being considered today cannot make up for the debt we owe to these men and women and their families. We cannot make up for the loss of life and limb and the mental anguish they will endure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But today, we will play a small positive role that I know is supported by every Member of this body. Today, we will vote to pass a small token of our gratitude--a small step in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is expected to be taken up by the Senate after we pass it here today and sent to the President this week. This is very fitting as we leave to celebrate Memorial Day--a day of remembrance for all who sacrificed in war for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a provision in this bill that has been added since we passed the bill last year. The  provision would ensure that a member of the military, who is married to an immigrant spouse would qualify for the stimulus rebate payment even if such spouse does not yet have a Social Security number.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This fix was necessary because in the zeal to impose anti-immigrant philosophy, language was added to the legislation for the stimulus rebate payments which now has a negative effect on some of our military and their families, even as they are off fighting a war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This should serve as a great lesson in caution and being circumspect before we allow our deep-seated feelings to get the best of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must learn from these lessons even as we fight to improve the lives of those who fight for our country through improved GI education benefits, pay increase, better health care services, and increased disability benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has been a labor of love. We passed a very similar bill (<bill type="h" number="3997">H.R. 3997</bill>) 410-0 on December 18, 2009, and had hoped to get it signed into law before the end of last year. Yet, despite the total bipartisan nature of this bill, we were unable to get it to the President's desk before the end of December, 2007. So, here we are again. Persistent to the end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is small but means a lot to many people. The Committee has received more calls on this bill than we could have imagined. People are calling to find out when the bill will become law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today gives us fresh hope--it looks like we will actually do it this time. I am proud to be a part of this small but important effort for our military men and women and their families who continue to give so much to our country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6081">H.R. 6081</bill>, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax (HEART) Act of 2008. This bill provides a number of much needed and deserved tax benefits to members of the military, their families, and veterans. Specifically, I am proud that the Qualified Veterans' Mortgage Bonds (QVMB) program, which impacts my home State of Wisconsin, was renewed and reformed so that the dream of home ownership will continue to be a reality for thousands of  veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the HEART Act, the QVMB program will be expanded to allow $100 million annually in tax exempt bonding for the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs (WDVA) State veterans home loan program--enough funding to aid about 600 State veterans in obtaining low interest rate home loans. This program is more important now than ever before with the ongoing credit crisis in this country, and I am proud we were able to expand it. In Wisconsin alone, the WDVA has made over 54,000 home loans to veterans  through this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other important provisions in this bill include allowing combat pay for troops to count as earned income for the Earned Income Tax Credit and making permanent the Internal Revenue Code provision that allows active duty reservists to make penalty-free withdrawals from their retirement plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our military service men and women have sacrificed a great deal to protect the freedoms that we so deeply cherish in this country. Their sacrifices and extended tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, however, have placed greater economic hardships on their families here at home. The bill before us today will help alleviate some of those hardships by giving military families much needed and deserved tax relief and making permanent some of the temporary provisions that Congress has previously enacted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The HEART Act is one simple but significant way we can thank our troops for their service to our country. I thank Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery for their bipartisan leadership on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support our men and women in the military by passing this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6081">H.R. 6081</bill>, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax (HEART) Act of 2008. This bill provides tax relief to America's heroic servicemembers. As a veteran of the Korean war, it is imperative that we assist the brave men and women who put their lives at risk in defending our Nation in any way we can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6081">H.R. 6081</bill> will improve tax benefits to members of the armed services. For example, today's legislation permanently extends the Earned Income Tax Credit for combat pay, allows for penalty-free withdrawal from servicemember pension plans, allows access for funds in Flexible Savings Accounts, and lets military death benefits to roll over into a Roth IRA or Education Savings Account. Given the crisis in the housing market, I am particularly heartened that <bill type="h" number="6081">H.R. 6081</bill> permanently establishes mortgage  bonds used to finance home purchases by veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill also extends the Economic Stimulus rebates that are being delivered as we speak today. <bill type="h" number="6081">H.R. 6081</bill> humanely permits servicemembers who are married to foreigners to receive the full value of their rebate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, the bill will restrict government contractors who move offshore to avoid paying Social Security and Medicare benefits. It is shocking that government contractors receive millions, or even billions, of taxpayer dollars and then try to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have put our Nation's finest men and women in a senseless war without an end. The least we can do is allow their families to enjoy the same benefits as their neighbors. Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense bill and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400233" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the Committee on Ways and Means for passing this important legislation, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Tax Relief Act. This legislation brings necessary tax relief to members of our armed services, veterans and their families and it also contains important technical corrections to a law that provides tax relief to volunteer emergency first responders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like our men and women in the armed services, volunteer emergency first responders provide a crucial service to our communities. They are in the front lines in the case of fire, natural disaster or other emergency. The majority of these brave men and women are volunteers and give up their time out of a sense of obligation to their communities. We owe them a debt of gratitude for their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> This technical correction clarifies that property tax rebates and other benefits that are made to volunteer emergency first responders and are excluded from gross income are not subject to Social Security tax or unemployment tax. This was the intent of the original legislation and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify this through HR. 6081, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Tax Relief Act.</paragraph>
