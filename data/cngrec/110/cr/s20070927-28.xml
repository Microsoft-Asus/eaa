  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="ALBUQUERQUE READS PROGRAM">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize the Albuquerque Reads program and Pat Dee for the work he has done on this immensely successful program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Albuquerque Reads has helped thousands of students in the Albuquerque area gain proficiency in reading. Reading can expand a student's imagination and open their minds to new ideas. Reading is the gateway to attaining knowledge. This very basic skill can catapult students into new levels of understanding and give them the tools they need to excel. I have always been an avid reader, which has helped me become what I am today. I never stop learning, and I hope these students never stop either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was a pleasure to visit with Pat Dee when I was in New Mexico a few weeks ago. The work he has done with this program has been noticed by many, including the President of the United States. Mr. Dee received a Volunteer Service Award from the President for the many hours he has dedicated to helping students learn to read. He directs over 300 volunteers who help facilitate the program and is looking to expand it with an additional 200 volunteers. Albuquerque Reads places these volunteers in  underperforming schools to tutor kindergarteners. With their help, reading proficiency has increased 40 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say thank you to Albuquerque Reads and Pat Dee for all that you have done for students in the area. I wish you much success in the future.</paragraph>
