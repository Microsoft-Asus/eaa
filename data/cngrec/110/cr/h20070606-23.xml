    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, June 6, marks the anniversary of D-day, the invasion of Normandy. It marks one of the most selfless acts of humanitarian love known in the history of mankind. It exemplifies a Nation's willingness to lay down our lives and to expend our treasure to free a people from brutal oppressors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Mr. Speaker, America remains the greatest Nation on earth, and we have our American soldiers to thank for securing our safety, for securing our freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To those who marched to a near certain death that morning on a French sandy shoreline, we pay you tribute. We can never repay the price that you paid for our freedom, but we will never forget that cost that you paid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no greater love than this but that we lay down our lives for our friends.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
