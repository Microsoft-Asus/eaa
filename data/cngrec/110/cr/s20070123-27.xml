    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to John and Jill Mahan, an exceptional young couple from Kentucky who are the recipients of the American Farm Bureau Young Farmers and Ranchers National Achievement Award. By winning this prestigious award, the Mahans exhibited an unprecedented passion and skill for farming, beating out competition from across the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Farm Bureau Young Farmers and Ranchers National  Achievement Award is presented to young farmers and ranchers across the United States who demonstrate knowledge and achievement in agriculture, as well as a steadfast strength and goal of promoting the agricultural community. With the average age of American farmers increasing steadily as the years go by, it is refreshing to see a young couple like the Mahans embrace the financial and labor-intensive  plight that is common in the field of agriculture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mahans own 523 acres of a 2,000-acre farm near their home in Lexington, KY. With the changing needs facing farmers, they quickly learned to diversify their production options and create alternatives for income. Currently, the Mahans produce burley tobacco, beef cattle, wheat, soybeans, corn, and alfalfa. This forward-thinking approach to the ever-changing agriculture market is a clear reason this couple experiences continued success in their farming career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate John and Jill Mahan on this prestigious award from the American Farm Bureau. By winning this national award, they have shown the rest of the Nation the strength of the agricultural community in Kentucky along with their personal dedication to their remarkable careers in farming. They are true examples of Kentucky at its finest.</paragraph>
