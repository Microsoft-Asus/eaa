    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a member of the bipartisan Congressional Prayer Caucus, as we do each week, to formally acknowledge the importance of prayer in American life and history. Today I remind my colleagues, constituents and country of our need for prayer by reading a portion of a proclamation by John Hancock 220 years ago in 1783 while he was Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said, "It has been the laudable Practice of this Country, to open the Business of the Year, by setting apart a Day for Religious Exercise, thereby to implore the Blessing of God upon all the Undertakings of his People.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"He hath been graciously pleased to hear our Prayers. At such a Time then, it is peculiarly fit and becoming for us as a People, while we express our Gratitude to Almighty God for his numerous and unmerited Favors, to humble ourselves before Him for our manifold Sins, and to profess our entire Dependence upon his paternal Care, beseeching Him to give us his Grace that we may be able to improve his Mercies to his Honor and Glory."</paragraph>
  </speaking>
