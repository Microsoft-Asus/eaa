    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the First Baptist Church in Mt. Zion, Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1957, the original 45 members of the Mt. Zion faith community gathered in front of a storefront on Main Street. They chose the name of First Baptist Church and organized a mission. The following year, that small congregation began construction on a new place of worship. As the congregation grew, so did its need for a larger building. The church moved to its present location in 1962.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the past 50 years, Mt. Zion Baptist Church has played an important role in the surrounding community through its education center, auditorium and mission. I'm happy to celebrate the church's 50th year of service, and I look forward to its continued growth and good works of its congregation.</paragraph>
