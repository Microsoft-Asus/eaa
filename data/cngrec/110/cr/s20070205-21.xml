  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Gang Abatement and Prevention Act, introduced by Senator Feinstein. Before discussing the details of this bill, I want to state how pleased I am that it has such broad bipartisan support. With 13 sponsors, 7 Democrats and 6 Republicans, I am hopeful that this bill can move quickly through Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gang-related violence is on the rise, in Colorado and throughout the Nation. Just by way of example: according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, Denver is home to roughly 12,470 gang members, who are affiliated with 110 gangs. Nationwide, there are roughly 730,000 gang members. Since 1999 the number of crimes investigated by the Denver gang unit has risen 35 percent; gang members were responsible for fully 35 percent of Denver's firearm-related homicides;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As these statistics show, gang violence is still a serious problem--and we in Congress have an obligation to respond. This bill is a good first-step, because it focuses on four key pillars of effective law enforcement policy: prevention; investigation and prosecution; firm and just penalties; and effective law enforcement training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On prevention, the bill would authorize $250 million for intervention programs focused on at-risk youth. These funds would be administered through a new High Intensity Interstate Gang Activity Area program, or HIGAA, which would be designed to facilitate cooperation between Federal, State, and local law enforcement in identifying, targeting, and eliminating violent gangs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have firsthand experience with the effectiveness of multijurisdictional law enforcement efforts: the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program, and the various local multijurisdictional drug task forces in Colorado, have successfully leveraged Federal, State, and local resources to fight crime. I support applying this model to the fight against gangs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the investigation and prosecution front, I am pleased that the bill would increase funding for the Justice Department, Federal prosecutors, and FBI agents to coordinate Federal enforcement against violent gangs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In regards to penalties for gang-related activity, this bill takes a sensible approach. It would replace the current sentencing enhancement for gang-related conduct with a new Federal antigang law that directly criminalizes gang crimes--and related conspiracies and attempts to commit crimes in furtherance of a criminal gang. The bill would also create new Federal offenses prohibiting the recruitment of minors into a criminal gang.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill would authorize $3-$5 million per year for the creation of a national gang violence prevention training center and clearinghouse, which would assist local law enforcment with training and the implementation of effective gang violence prevention models. Since my time as attorney general, I have been acutely aware of the importance of effective law enforcement training--and I am pleased that this bill contains provisions which would directly address this important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a sensible, comprehensive bill. By focusing on prevention, investigation, prosecution, punishment, and training, I am hopeful that it will give our law enforcement agencies--Federal, State, and local--the resources they need to effectively fight the growth of gangs and gang activity.</paragraph>
