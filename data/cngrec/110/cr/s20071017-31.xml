  <narrative>BORDER BINATIONAL HEALTH WEEK -- (Senate - October 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12983">S12983</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to commemorate Border Binational  Health Week. Being that New Mexico is a border State, I have great interest in honoring the citizens of my State who live and work near the border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Border Binational Health Week, which is celebrated this week, is a way for border States to promote sustainable partnerships to help address border health issues. This year's theme is "Families in Action for Health," which is an effort to make sure all people are healthy, and families working together can make sure that happens. Border States have a unique set of concerns citizens elsewhere may not experience. By recognizing Border Binational Health Week, we can begin a dialogue on these issues,  between countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several events are being held around the State to raise awareness. The events include a Red Ribbon Rally Parade and Health Fair in Sunland Park; a Family Health Fair in Las Cruces; a Health Disparities Forum in Silver City; a 1 1/2  mile Walk out West in Alamogordo; and a Youth Promotora Training and Educational Workshop in Animas and Lordsburg. Each of these activities help promote healthy living in border States, and especially border communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that border health will be discussed not only during this week but all year long.</paragraph>
