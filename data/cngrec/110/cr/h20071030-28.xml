  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="T, LINDA" of="">
    <paragraph>S&#xC1;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill>, the Internet Tax Freedom Act Amendments Act, as amended. <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill>, legislation designed to extend the Internet tax moratorium and grandfather protections, clarify the treatment of gross receipts taxes, and revise the definition of Internet access is bipartisan legislation at its best. It has widespread support by industry groups including the Don't Tax Our Web Coalition, as well as by various government organizations such as the National Governors Association,  the Federation of Tax Administrators, the National Conference of Mayors, and the National Conference of State Legislatures. It is supported by a wide range of labor and union groups, including the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with that broad support, the House passed <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill> by a vote of 405-2. <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill>, as amended by the Senate, contains four distinct changes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the Senate version extends the moratorium on State and local taxes on Internet access and continues grandfather protections for 7 years until November 1, 2014. The 7-year time frame will allow Congress to revisit the moratorium and consider developments in the States or in technology. It will provide businesses sufficient time to plan and ensure that consumers benefit from tax-free access to the Internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the Senate version extends from November 1, 2007 to June 30, 2008 the time for certain States to adjust for a phaseout of the grandfather protection. This alteration will benefit State governments who would have scrambled to readjust their budgets with a loss of revenue beginning November 1.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, the Senate version expands the definition of Internet access to prohibit taxation of certain services which are fee-based, not packaged with Internet access, and are offered from sources other than providers of Internet access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the Senate version prohibits a State from reimposing Internet access taxes if the State had eliminated the taxes more than 2 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For nearly 10 years, we have had the luxury of tax-free Internet access, as we have acted under a moratorium passed by Congress, but the moratorium expires in less than 2 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>With the impending end of the moratorium in sight, this Chamber agreed nearly unanimously to pass <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill>, the Internet Tax Freedom Act Amendments Act. This legislation is an example of how a bipartisan approach to a complex issue can serve the public good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the Senate made some changes to <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill>, this is a version I'm very proud to support. It retains the essence of <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill>, including refining the definition of Internet access and, most importantly, providing a temporary extension of the moratorium. This legislation minimizes the effect on State and local government revenue, treats businesses fairly, and keeps Internet access affordable to consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remind my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that the current Internet tax moratorium expires in about 36 hours. Madam Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill>, the amended Internet Tax Freedom Act Amendments Act, so that tax-free access to the Internet can continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking speaker="400381" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I'm pleased that we are considering a bill to extend the Internet tax moratorium another 7 years. With only 2 days left until the moratorium expires, it's high time that Congress passes this important legislation and gets it to the President's desk for his signature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two weeks ago, the House approved <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill>, a bill to extend the Internet tax moratorium for 4 years. I supported  this legislation because it accomplished several positive things. For example, it clarified the definition of Internet access to ensure that States do not tax Internet access, including the acquisition of transmission capabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I was disappointed that it did not permanently ban taxes on Internet access and e-commerce and that the House Democratic leadership refused to allow a vote on permanency, even though over 240 Members are cosponsors of a permanent extension.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, by passing <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill> with the Senate amendments, we are taking a step in the right direction. This legislation extends the moratorium for 7 years, almost doubling what the House approved only 2 weeks ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate amendments to <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill> also made several other important changes to the law. The Senate extended the coverage of the moratorium to all e-mail, regardless of whether it was bundled with Internet access. With respect to the original grandfathered States, the Senate added a new "use it or lose it" provision that says that if one of those States repeals or otherwise does not enforce its tax on Internet access, it loses its grandfather protections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think these are good changes to the original House-passed bill, and I am happy to support them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By extending the ban on Internet access taxes for a longer period of time, we give businesses the certainty they need to spend billions of dollars to construct, maintain and update the broadband Internet infrastructure throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will help keep the cost of Internet access down so that all individuals can continue to use the great informational tool that is the Internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I'm disappointed that we're not making the ban permanent, which has wide support in the House, we are certainly moving in the right direction by passing <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill> today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hundreds of companies and groups, including AOL, Apple, Americans for Tax Reform, AT&amp;T, Comcast, eBay, Electronic Industries Alliance, Level 3 Communications, the National Association of Manufacturers, National Cable and Telecommunications Association, National Taxpayers Union, Sprint/Nextel, Time Warner Communications, T-Mobile, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, U.S. Telecom Association, U.S. Internet Industry Association, Verizon, Yahoo, the Business Software Alliance, and the Hispanic Technology and  Telecommunications Partnership, among many, many others, have, in fact, called for a permanent ban on Internet access taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill> doesn't get us all the way to the goal line, it is a step forward that will benefit the economy and the consumer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, if we are going to have a healthy economy in America, if we are going to continue to create jobs, if we're going to continue to enjoy a high standard of living, if we are going to continue to increase productivity, we have to do everything we can to encourage and help the high-tech industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To that end, I support <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill>, but I still would like to see Congress pass a permanent moratorium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="T, LINDA" of="">
    <paragraph>S&#xC1;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 1/2  minutes to the gentlelady from California, a colleague of mine who's very knowledgeable on Internet tax issues, Ms. ANNA ESHOO. </paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking speaker="400124" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the amended legislation that's before us. Two weeks ago when the House brought legislation to the floor on Internet taxation, I was only one of two that opposed it. Now, I opposed it not because I opposed extending the moratorium. Quite to the contrary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offered legislation with Mr. Goodlatte that would have made Internet taxation, a ban on it, permanent. We introduced legislation that enjoyed over 240 bipartisan cosponsors. That legislation was not considered by the Judiciary Committee or the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also contained a loophole that could have opened up the possibility of new taxes on the Internet services such as e-mail and music downloading. I knew we could do better and today we are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate-amended legislation will establish the longest term for the Internet tax moratorium since it was first created in 1998. The Congress acted on that again in 2001 and 2004, and today's moratorium is the longest that will be adopted. So I think it's cause for celebration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation will guarantee that new barriers created by taxation of Internet access and e-commerce will not emerge when the current moratorium ends, which is just, as the chairwoman said, 36 hours away. So we're coming in right under the wire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that this is very important policy for our country. Very importantly, this is going to continue to spur innovation, and it will advance our goal of broadband for everyone in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm very, very pleased at the Senate action, under the leadership of really the father of this effort, Senator RON WYDEN, new father of twins, a son and a daughter, many congratulations to him. I urge all of my colleagues. This should be a 100 percent vote in the House for a 7-year moratorium, and I thank the leadership for bringing it to the floor and the chairwoman for her leadership on this as well.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400381" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and the principal Republican sponsor of the permanent ban on Internet taxes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. GOODLATTE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400154" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Texas for his leadership on this issue, as well as that of the two gentlewomen from California, Congresswoman Eshoo and Congresswoman Lofgren, who have been advocates of a permanent extension of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased that the House leadership has now seen fit to schedule a vote on a bill to extend the Internet tax moratorium for longer than the mere 4-year extension contained in the House-passed bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I'm still extremely disappointed that the majority did not allow any amendments to <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill> when it was considered by the full House. The handling of that bill 2 weeks ago by the House leadership is unfortunately reflective of the stranglehold that leadership has placed on the will of the majority in this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had introduced legislation, along with Representative Eshoo, to make the ban on Internet access taxes permanent, and that legislation had garnered nearly 240 bipartisan cosponsors before the House was forced to vote on the 4-year extension. These cosponsors represent a strong bipartisan majority of the Members of this body. However, with absolutely no explanation, the majority party cut off all opportunity for amendments to that legislation on the House floor, where I have no doubt  an amendment to make the ban on access taxes on the Internet permanent would have passed with a very strong majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During committee consideration, the House Judiciary Committee even resorted to obscure procedural tactics to reverse a vote for an amendment in committee to extend the moratorium from 4 years to 8 years. Because all but one Democrat, Congresswoman Lofgren, on the committee voted against an amendment I offered there to extend the moratorium for 6 years, I assume that to be consistent they will vote against the 7-year extension before us today, but we shall see.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to the merits of a 4-year extension, we heard arguments that the Senate would not accept anything longer than a 4-year extension. However, that has proven not to be the case. Now, House leadership has been forced to schedule a vote on a bill to extend the moratorium for 7 years because the current moratorium expires tomorrow. It's a shame they did not do this, and more, voluntarily when they had the chance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, the Senate, and I, too, join in commending Senator Wyden and Senator Sununu in the bipartisan effort that was made in the Senate, which passed a more reasonable bill with a longer term of protection for American taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today extends the moratorium for almost twice as long as  the House-passed bill, and while I would prefer a permanent ban, this is a vast improvement over current law. This bill will continue to help ensure that the digital divide does not grow between those who can and cannot afford broadband Internet access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill will also help ensure that businesses have more certainty when making business decisions about whether to deploy broadband to areas they do not currently serve, such as rural areas across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the Members of this body to support this important legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>S&#xC1;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, at this time, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlelady from California (Ms. Zoe Lofgren), a colleague of mine on the subcommittee and the Committee on the Judiciary.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking speaker="400245" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a welcome and refreshing instance of bipartisan, bicameral cooperation, the Senate took our bill and improved it. The longer moratorium means that service providers will have more certainty when deciding whether to make critical investments in basic infrastructure of the Internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 7-year extension is longer than any that has ever been approved by any previous Congress. Consideration of this bill today shows that the Democrats in the 110th Congress truly understand the importance of the Internet to our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Equally important, the bill as amended makes absolutely clear that Internet access embraces ancillary services such as e-mail, instant messaging and personal storage capacity. This change removes ambiguity with respect to these services, and thereby encourages robust competition among Internet service providers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And importantly, today is October 30. By passing the extension of the Internet tax moratorium with ample time for the President to sign the bill into law, we avoid the almost certain disruption that would attend any further delay. Failure to act would be a mistake and a step away from the pledges we made in the Innovation Agenda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I continue to believe that a permanent ban on the taxation of Internet access is important to maintaining and improving our place in the information economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remain a proud cosponsor of my friend ANNA ESHOO's bill that would have made the moratorium permanent. I will continue to work with her and Mr. Goodlatte to achieve that goal, but I heartily accept <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill> as a fair compromise between our position and the views of those who are reluctant to entirely abandon the possibility of one day taxing the Internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ultimately, we will reach the legislative conclusion that taxing the Internet is simply a bad idea. Fortunately, this bill buys us enough time to get there and is an important, big step in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aside from supporting expansion of the broadband and innovation, it's also good news for American families that they will not face a new tax burden when they utilize the Internet come November 1. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important and very timely legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the chairwoman of the subcommittee.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412011" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's make it clear what this bill does not do. What it does not do is it does not prohibit States or localities from putting general application taxes on Internet transactions as they would apply if that transaction were taking place not on the Internet. For example, it does not ban sales taxes on transactions over the Internet, as long as those taxes are the same sales taxes as would be applied if that purchase was transacted in a store or over a catalog, but what it does do is it says you  cannot put discriminatory taxes on the Internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>You cannot take that sales transaction and give it a sales tax that is higher because it was transacted over the Internet than if it were not. It also says that you cannot tax access or use to the Internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Can you imagine, can anyone out there imagine that if every time you sent an e-mail there was a tax that went on your credit card or something for using it, or every time you went on a Web site, there was a tax? That's absolutely unconscionable. Particularly today, when we realize how much of the economic growth we have experienced in this decade has come from the Internet and how much distribution of knowledge there has been and how it is a great equalizer that so many people at so many incomes  and in so many locations are able to access knowledge that was previously unavailable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Internet has been a great engine for economic growth and for the distribution of knowledge. We don't want to slow down that engine by taxing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now I, like I believe every other speaker this morning, wishes that this bill were a permanent ban. I can't imagine a time when we would want to restrict your access to the Internet by taxing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, 4 years is better than zero, and 7 years is better than 4. So this 7-year extension is something that I will heartily support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I also desperately hope that before we get to the day of the expiration of this next 7-year period, that sometime within this 7 years that this Congress realizes and recognizes once and for all that taxing the access to or use of the Internet is a bad idea and makes this ban permanent in the future.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for allowing me to have a little bit of time this morning to talk about a very important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am one of those Members of Congress who actually reads and signs all of his legislative mail from their district. I can remember not too long ago there was a write-in campaign to every congressional office complaining about a bill that Congressman Snell had introduced that was going to tax the Internet, every single piece of transaction that one might have on the Internet. Of course, as we know as we look at this board, and I have served in this Congress, I like to say not long  enough, but I have never served with a Congressman Snell in the 21 years that Mr. Smith and I have served here together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I went through it to find out when did Congressman Snell serve? There must have been a Congressman Snell. Well, there was. He served in the 64th Congress. Now, that was a long, long time ago, and I daresay it was before the Internet. It was before Al Gore invented the Internet, and it was before the Senate and the House discovered it as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But can you imagine taxing every different thing that one might do on the Internet?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look at our own household here and back in Michigan. Often we come home, my wife and I, the first thing we do is we get on the Internet. We check what our daughters might be saying at college. Two nights ago I was doing some Internet surfing, and I got IMs from my daughter, probably about 20, 25. It was a wonderful experience that she and I had communicating. But can you imagine if there was a tax on every single IM message that came back and forth?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of us do our banking on the Internet, check our different accounts. Can you imagine every single time you are going to get a tax on the Internet? For me, I am a sports nut, my Wolverines. I was at MGoBlue last night a couple of different times. When is the Michigan-Michigan State game going to be on this weekend? Can you imagine if you got taxed every time? I wanted to check if Michael Hart was going to play this Saturday. I checked a bunch of different Web sites. Can you  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H12164]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank goodness we are extending the current moratorium that otherwise expires this week. Now, I am one that wanted to make it a permanent extension. I join with Mr. Goodlatte and Mr. Smith and others as a cosponsor of legislation so that we don't have to do this every single year. We passed in the House a couple of weeks ago a bill that was unanimous, in fact, as I recall, that extended it for 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate finally did something right; they actually extended it beyond 4 years. We are going to see an extension for 7 years. Even though it's not permanent, 7 years is better than nothing, and that's what we are doing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as I think about all the different uses that we use on the Internet today, to think that we would tax every e-mail, every search of the Web, all those different things. As the former chairman of the Telecommunications Subcommittee, I know that this will stifle the growth of the Internet in a major, major way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask all of my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to support this extension. Let's get it to the President. I am sure that he will sign it, hopefully, before the week is out, so that we can no longer have the audacity to think that a Congressman Snell will come back and, in fact, perhaps introduce a piece of legislation that will, in fact, tax every Internet transaction. It would be disastrous.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>S&#xC1;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill>, as amended by the Senate, remains a strong bill that provides much-needed clarity to the communications and Internet industries and strikes an appropriate balance in addressing the needs of States and local governments while helping keep Internet access affordable. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill>, the Internet Tax Freedom Act Amendments Act, as amended by the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Internet has changed the way we communicate, learn, and do business--all for the better. Since the Internet tax moratorium was first adopted, tremendous investment, growth and innovation in the scope and use of the Internet has occurred. By preventing unnecessary taxation of the Internet, Congress has fostered growth in productivity, spurred innovation, and widened public access to information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This expansion is impressive. However, there is still more that Congress can do to ensure equal Internet access among all Americans. As I stated when the House passed its 4-year extension, permanently prohibiting unnecessary taxes, such as an Internet access, is the best course of action for accomplishing this goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The surest way to stifle achievement, progress, and growth is to involve the government. I urge my colleagues to pass <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill>'s 7-year extension and use this time to work together to permanently extend the moratorium in order to foster the innovation and the free market that have been the formula for economic growth and prosperity.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, though I would have voted "yea" on the Internet Tax Freedom Act, it is not the vote I wished to have had. I along with 242 bi-partisan co-sponsors wanted to see the Internet Tax Moratorium made permanent instead of an extension for 7 years. Through negotiations in the House, members were told that the Senate would never agree to anything longer than 4 years. Then, we were forced to vote on a 4-year extension October 16, without the opportunity to add amendments  to lengthen the ban--or even make it permanent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today we are now voting on a Senate amendment to <bill type="h" number="3678">H.R. 3678</bill>, extending the ban for 7 years--3 more years than what we were told the Senate would agree to. Imagine what we could have accomplished had the democrat leadership had listened to the will of 242 members from both sides of the aisle asking to make this ban permanent.</paragraph>
