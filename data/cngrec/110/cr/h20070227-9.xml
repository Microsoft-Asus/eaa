    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during Black History Month, Diane Sumpter has earned front-page cover status in the Greater Columbia Business Monthly of South Carolina for developing one of the most prestigious minority business firms. DESA, Inc., has grown to be a nationally recognized management consultant firm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Sumpter is a native of Jacksonville, Florida. She later moved to Columbia, where she graduated from Booker T. Washington High School and then attended the University of South Carolina, where she obtained both a B.A. in English and a master's degree in social work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Sumpter's dedication to the growth and success of minority- and women-owned businesses is evidenced in her efforts with the South Carolina Minority Business Development Center, which is operated by her company. The center has assisted businesses by acting as a liaison to facilitate business growth for over 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since DESA was started in 1986, it has been awarded service contracts from HHS, the Department of Commerce, the Minority Business Development Agency, the Army, the Air Force, the Small Business Administration, as well as various contracts from the private sector. DESA works with companies from the very beginning of projects until their completion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11 and the courageous service of Army Chief Warrant Officer II, Jason De Frenn of Barnwell, South Carolina.</paragraph>
