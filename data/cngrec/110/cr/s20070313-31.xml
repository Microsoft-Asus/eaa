    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to announce for the information of the Senate and the public that the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs will hold a hearing entitled "Medicare Doctors Who Cheat on Their Taxes and What Should Be Done About It."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the fourth hearing to result from a three year investigation conducted by the Subcommittee into Federal contractors that provide goods or services to the Federal Government, but fail to pay their taxes. A 2004 hearing determined that 27,000 contractors with the Department of Defense had a tax debt totaling roughly $3 billion. A 2005 hearing determined that 33,000 contractors doing business with civilian Federal agencies had unpaid taxes totaling $3.3 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to examining contractors for DOD and civilian agencies, the Subcommittee has examined similar misconduct by contractors for the General Services Administration (GSA). A Subcommittee hearing in March 2006 determined that 3,800 GSA contractors collectively owed $1.4 billion in unpaid taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The upcoming March 20th hearing will further explore the problem, focusing specifically on Medicare physicians and related suppliers that receive substantial income from the Federal Government but do not pay the taxes that they owe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Witnesses for the upcoming hearing will include representatives from the Government Accountability Office, the Internal Revenue Service, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, as well as the Financial Management Service. A final witness list will be available on Friday, March 16, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Subcommittee hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, March 20, 2007, at 2:30 p.m. in Room 342 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. For further information, please contact Elise J. Bean, of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at 224-3721.</paragraph>
