    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday Republicans were forced repeatedly to use procedural maneuvers to protest the unjust proposed change of current House rules denying the minority's right to participate in floor debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The political headlines today are correct: "Dems Bend Rules, Break Pledge." If enacted, this would be the first change to such a rule since 1822.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After declaring to run the "most open Congress in history," Democrat leaders have repeatedly broken this promise and sought to stifle the minority's voice, beginning with their first 100 hours and now even through 100 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Democrat leaders are intent on suppressing the representative voice of nearly half of the American population, Republicans are left with no choice but to fight for our right of participation in the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
