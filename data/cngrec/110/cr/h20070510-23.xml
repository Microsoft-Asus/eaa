  <speaking speaker="400339" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Iraq must be held responsible. No one can be forced to have a democracy; they must want to themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Iraqi government must meet the security, political and economic benchmarks that they have set for themselves. I would think that every Member of this Congress would want to hold the Iraqi Government accountable for the promises it has made earlier this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On our supplemental, the bill fully funds the troops for the next 2 to 3 months, ensuring that they have everything they need to conduct their mission. The bill includes additional funding to include improve military readiness above the President's request. The bill includes additional $1.8 billion for veterans' health care above the President's request. The bill also includes additional funding for the troops above what the President has requested. It is time for us to hold the Iraqi government  responsible and ask them to come up to the plate as we have done ourselves.</paragraph>
