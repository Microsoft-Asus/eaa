  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the World Health Organization and the International Diabetes Federation established World Diabetes Day in 1991 with the aim of coordinating diabetes advocacy worldwide;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas World Diabetes Day is celebrated annually on November 14;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on December 20, 2006, the General Assembly of the United Nations passed a landmark resolution recognizing diabetes as a chronic, debilitating, and costly disease;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the resolution designates World Diabetes Day as a United Nations Day to be observed every year starting in 2007 in order to raise global awareness of diabetes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the theme of the 2007 United Nations World Diabetes Day campaign focuses on raising awareness of diabetes in children and adolescents, who face unique challenges when diagnosed with diabetes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United Nations campaign aims, among other objectives, to firmly establish the message that no child should die of diabetes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the global diabetes epidemic has devastating effects on families, societies, and national economies;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas diabetes is the fourth leading cause of death by disease in the world, and is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas diabetes is a leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, amputation, heart attack, and stroke;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in almost every country the incidence of diabetes is increasing, growing from an estimated 30,000,000 people worldwide in 1985 to an estimated 245,000,000 people in 2007, and to 380,000,000 by 2025, as reported by the International Diabetes Federation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas diabetes is one of the most common chronic childhood diseases;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas diabetes can strike children at any age, and when diagnosed in young people the risk of developing life-threatening complications at an early age increases and life expectancy is shortened by, on average, 10 to 20 years;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas new figures from the International Diabetes Federation's Diabetes Atlas suggest that more than 70,000 children develop type 1 diabetes each year and 440,000 children worldwide under the age of 14 now live with type 1 diabetes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas recent data indicate that one out of every three children born in the United States will develop diabetes during their lifetime, including one out of every two children from ethnic minority groups;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in low- and middle-income countries, many children with diabetes die because they are diagnosed late or misdiagnosed or because insulin is unaffordable, unavailable, or in short supply;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the incidence of type 2 diabetes, which was previously rare in children, is rising at alarming rates, with more than 200 children a day developing this form of diabetes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas obesity is a major contributor to type 2 diabetes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas according to the International Obesity Task Force of the International Association for the Study of Obesity, 155,000,000 school-age children worldwide are overweight, representing at least 1 out of every 10 school-age children;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas at least 30,000,000 of those overweight children are classified as obese, accounting for at least 2 percent of the world's children between the ages of 5 and 17 years of age;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas research has shown conclusively that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or significantly delayed through healthy weight maintenance and regular physical activity;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas adopting a lifestyle high in physical activity and adopting a low-sugar, low-fat diet can successfully prevent the onset of obesity and diabetes among school-age children;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas diabetes is costly, with the world estimated to spend at least $232,000,000,000 in 2007 and over $302,500,000,000 by 2025 to treat and prevent diabetes and its complications; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas world treatment costs for diabetes are growing more quickly than the world population;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas diabetes threatens to subvert global economic advancement by both straining government budgets worldwide (with the cost of diabetes-related disability payments, pensions, social and medical service costs, and lost revenue) and burdening private health insurers and employers with spiraling health care costs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas by 2025 the largest increases in diabetes prevalence will take place in developing countries, whose economies are less able to support increased expenditures to provide for those with the disease and engage in effective prevention efforts; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the economic impact of diabetes threatens to undermine the achievement of the United Nation's Millennium Development Goals for developing countries: Now, therefore, be it</narrative>

  <narrative>(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to offer House Concurrent Resolution 211, pronouncing that Congress supports the goals and ideals of World Diabetes Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me thank Representative Manzullo, who was a prime cosponsor of this legislation, and other Members, for cosponsoring this bipartisan resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This global health awareness campaign established in 1991 by the World Health Organization and International Diabetes Federation is celebrated annually on November 14. This marks the birthday of Dr. Frederick Grant Banting, a Canadian medical scientist, Nobel laureate, and co-discoverer of insulin. And now, it is an official United Nations recognized day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>World Diabetes Day aims to coordinate diabetes advocacy worldwide. In almost every country of the world, the incidence of diabetes is on the rise. Diabetes is the fourth leading cause of global death by disease. In the United States, it is the sixth leading cause of death including accidents, but of deaths by disease it climbs to number five.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The economic burden on both developed and developing countries due to a dramatic increase in the prevalence of diabetes was analyzed in a new report from the Economist Intelligence Unit. Diabetes currently affects 246 million people worldwide and is expected to affect 380 million people by 2025. In 2007, the five countries with the largest number of people with diabetes are India, China, the United States, Russia, and Germany. Worse, each year 3.8 million deaths are attributed to diabetes. An  even greater number die from complications, renal failure, vascular loss. Soberly, every 10 seconds, two people develop diabetes and a person dies from diabetes-related causes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 20, 2006, the General Assembly of the United Nations passed landmark Resolution 61-225, recognizing diabetes as a chronic, debilitating, and costly disease. This is the first year, therefore, that the World Diabetes Day has risen to such prominence, and it is fitting that here in the United States Congress we support it this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, World Diabetes Day has annually focused on a particular aspect or complication of diabetes, the heart, the eyes, the kidneys, and feet. I am especially pleased that this year the World Diabetes Day's theme focuses on raising awareness of diabetes in children and adolescents who face unique challenges when diagnosed with diabetes. The campaign aimed to firmly establish the message that no child should die from diabetes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a senior member of the Committee on Education and Labor and Foreign Affairs, as a delegate to the United Nations since 2003 and 2005, I see this year's theme as a perfect synergy of a global health and childhood issue, with importance to the United Nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as we speak here, November 1 in Bermuda, 246 people dressed in U.N. blue t-shirts to represent the 246 million people in the world with diabetes. They stood up. Tomorrow in Lagos, Nigeria, there will be a walk starting at Maryland and ending at Lagos State University, where there will be young people asking folks to have their blood sugar level checked. In Australia, from November 11 to November 20, there are children-centered activities from a Switch-Off Turn On to Play Pledge that will once  again highlight this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, as I conclude, while commemorating World Diabetes Day, of course I can look no further than my own congressional district of New Jersey to find shining examples of the dedication to diabetes in the area of education in St. Barnabas Hospital and Newark Beth Israel are all leaders, and we hope that everyone will join in this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote for passage of House Concurrent Resolution 211, supporting the goals and ideals of World Diabetes Day.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues in this bipartisan effort to bring greater awareness to World Diabetes Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleague said, 225,000 people per year die in the United States alone from diabetes. But I believe that, as we recognize this day, we have to recognize that diabetes doesn't just kill; diabetes debilitates. It causes blindness. It takes away all or part of limbs. It slows people down in their day-to-day ability to enjoy life. One of the great inventors of our time invented the insulin pump, which allowed people to not have to periodically stop to take medicine, but it didn't change the  debilitating effect that artificially-given insulin causes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do not have a cure for diabetes today. We need to continue working toward that, as many of our pharmaceutical companies are. So bringing awareness to this is just a first step in making sure that the United States, Europe, and the other developed nations work hard to find real cures for this dreadful disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of <bill type="hc" number="211">H. Con. Res. 211</bill>, which supports the goals and ideals of World Diabetes Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, diabetes is among the most lethal diseases known to man. It kills about 225,000 people per year in the United States alone--fifth among disease-related deaths and roughly equal to the population of New Orleans or Madison, WI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it's generally believed to be significantly under-reported on death certificates, especially among the old--who may endure multiple chronic conditions, many caused by diabetes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because, as anyone who has diabetes knows all too well, when you have diabetes, you don't just have diabetes. The disease leads to increased risk of a number of seriously, sometimes life-threatening complications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These include--but certainly aren't limited to--heart disease and stroke, blindness, high blood pressure, kidney disease, nervous-system disease, dental disease, even pregnancy complications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Strokes and heart disease are two to four times more likely for those with diabetes than those without, and diabetes is the leading cause of new blindness cases in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of these associated health problems can be avoided with good diabetes control, but many people don't realize they have diabetes until it has caused one of these other diseases. Indeed, of the 21 million people in the United States who have diabetes, nearly a third don't yet know it. Those who do spend about one in every 10 dollars we spend on health care in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I applaud efforts such as World Diabetes Day that call attention to the problems this disease causes and the need for further research and outreach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to do what we can to solve this mystery and slow this killer--both to alleviate the pain, suffering and expense of our fellow citizens afflicted by the disease and for our own economic benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Experts say diabetes costs the U.S. economy $132 billion per year. That's what we spend on telecom in a year. It's the total Gross Domestic Product of Singapore and matches, roughly, what the country spends on all research and development in a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I know people who suffer from diabetes. So does everyone in this House. Approving a resolution does not do much to alleviate that suffering. But today, it is what we have the opportunity to do. Let us do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues in supporting the promotion of awareness about diabetes and all of its complications and commend Mr. Payne for his introduction of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="hc" number="211">H. Con. Res. 211</bill>, a bill that supports the goals and ideals of World Diabetes Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hc" number="211">H. Con. Res. 211</bill>, which has 54 cosponsors, was introduced by Rep. Donald Payne on September 17, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hc" number="211">H. Con. Res. 211</bill> was reported from the Oversight Committee on November 8, 2007, by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Hyperglycemia, which is known as raised blood sugar, over time can lead to serious damage to many parts of the body, especially the nerves and blood vessels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1991, the World Health Organization and the International Diabetes Federation established World Diabetes Day. World Diabetes Day is celebrated on November 14th. This day was designated to promote the awareness that every person with diabetes or the risk of acquiring diabetes should receive the best possible education, prevention and care available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, more than 240 million people in the world are living with diabetes. Some analysts believed this number will grow to 340 million within 20 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague Representative Payne for seeking to support the goals and ideals of World Diabetes Day and urge the swift passage of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, <bill type="hc" number="211">H. Con. Res. 211</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
