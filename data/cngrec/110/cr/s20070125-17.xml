    <paragraph>Mr. President, one effort that must not be overlooked in our fight to combat gun violence, is the work of local law enforcement agencies. Detroit's Joshua Project is but one example of the successful work law enforcement agencies are doing all across the country. The Joshua Project began in 2004 as a collaborative effort between multiple law enforcement agencies, to curb gun violence in Detroit's Southwestern 3rd Precinct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Joshua Project, modeled after programs in several other cities including Boston, Minneapolis, and Indianapolis, institutes a zero tolerance policy when a gang member commits any type of gun violence. Any gang member's use of a gun results in strict and sustained law enforcement attention for everyone in the gang. The project also seeks to deter gun violence by increased monitoring of probationers and parolees through the use of unscheduled home visits and mandatory call-in meetings. So far  over 2,000 former offenders have been called in and nearly 3,000 home checks have been conducted. These measures give law enforcement officials the opportunity to proactively intervene in a high-risk offender's life before another crime is committed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The implementation of the program relies on an innovative partnership between the Detroit Police Department, the Attorney General's Office and Michigan Department of Corrections, along with the assistance of the State courts. Community involvement also plays a critical role in offering both ideas and solutions within the Joshua Project. Community organizations provide assistance, support and counseling to offenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Within the first 17 months after the Joshua Project was implemented, shootings in Detroit's 3rd precinct decreased almost 33 percent and gun related homicides dropped nearly 40 percent. As a result of this success, Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, Attorney General Mike Cox, and Governor Jennifer Granholm announced this past summer that the Joshua Project would be expanded to Detroit's 2nd precinct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mayor Kilpatrick said of this expansion:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are most successful in our fight against crime when we maximize the strengths of our law enforcement partners throughout the country and state. Our partnership with the Attorney General has reduced gun violence and has saved lives in southwest Detroit. By expanding this program, we hope to build upon our current successes and make the neighborhoods of the second precinct as safe, if not safer, than we have in the third precinct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take this opportunity to thank all State and local law enforcement officials for their continued service and vital contributions in ensuring the safety of our communities. I am hopeful the 110th Congress will support their efforts by taking up and passing sensible gun safety legislation.</paragraph>
