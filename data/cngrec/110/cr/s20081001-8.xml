    <paragraph>Mr. President, after Monday's vote in the House, the question is not how we got here but how we get out and how to get our economy back on its feet. So after extensive consultation between the majority leader and myself and the leaders in both parties here in the Senate, we believe we have crafted a way to go forward and to get us back on track. This is the only way to get the right kind of solution for the American people. Both Senator Obama and Senator McCain  are coming back tonight to embrace this effort and to help us reassure the American people that we are going to fix this problem.</paragraph>

But we are in the process of setting that aside, rising to the challenge--both Democrats and Republicans--and doing what is right for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
