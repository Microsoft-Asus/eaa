    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to recognize a great American and a true military hero who has honorably served our country for 26 years in the Army and Army Nurse Corps: COL Barbara J. Bruno has a true passion for nursing and served in a variety of clinical nursing and leadership positions at various Army medical facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her tremendous leadership skills led to her selection for long-term schooling to obtain an advanced degree in nursing and subsequent selection for director of the operation room nurse course. Colonel Bruno served with distinction in a series of senior leadership positions as Army nurse corps staff officer, AMEDD personnel proponency directorate, chief nurse, 30th Medical Brigade deputy commander for nursing, chief nurse 67th Combat Support Hospital personnel management officer, and chief, perioperative  nursing services. In every circumstance, Colonel Bruno was recognized for her clinical excellence and loyal, dedicated, and stellar leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, Colonel Bruno was appointed the deputy chief of the Army Nurse Corps. As deputy chief, Colonel Bruno developed and implemented policies and procedures that affected nearly 35,000 nursing personnel throughout the Army. She spearheaded several recruitment and retention initiatives to include the Funded Nurse Education Program, the Professional Nurse Education Program, the Registered Nurse First Assist Program, and increased capacity for the Army Enlisted Commissioning Program. Her tenacity  also led to additional recruitment options and incentive pays to retain our highly qualified nurse officers. As chair of the Federal Nursing Service Council, she sponsored the development of a Federal nursing research model that focused on improved soldier readiness and patient care outcomes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colonel Bruno's accomplishments are eloquent testimony to her talent, dedication, loyalty, and determination to see that the best possible nursing care is always available to our soldiers, their family members, and our deserving retirees. Colonel Bruno has established a legacy of superior performance to be emulated by all, and her performance reflects greatly on herself, the U.S. Army, the Department of Defense, and the United States of America. I extend my deepest appreciation on behalf  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="279">S279</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations to COL Barbara J. Bruno. I wish her Godspeed.</paragraph>
