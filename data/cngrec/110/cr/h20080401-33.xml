  <narrative>CONGRESS SHOULD APPROVE THE U.S. TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1831]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement means growth and more jobs for the largest exporter and manufacturing nation in the world, the United States. Colombia already gets free access to our market. The agreement levels the playing field while bolstering the economy of our strongest South American ally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colombia's government has a strong track record of reducing all violence, including attacks against union members. As the Washington Post editorialized on Monday, a vote for Colombia "would show Latin America that a staunch U.S. ally will be rewarded for improving its human rights record and resisting the anti-American populism of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this agreement merits approval by the Congress soon.</paragraph>
