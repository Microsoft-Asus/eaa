  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, efforts to cut off funding for our troops in harm's way is really unacceptable and would be a devastating message for us to send to our men and women in our Armed Forces, to their families, and to the families of our Nation's fallen heroes. No one knows this better  than SAM JOHNSON, our colleague from Texas, who is a true American hero; and I commend him for introducing House Resolution 511. I would commend it to  every Member of this body to support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to say to the Democrats that if they should mean what they say and do what they mean, they really cannot have it both ways on this vote. To vote to support the troops in the field and then not give them the equipment and the supplies and the resources that they need to win is deceptive, it is dangerous, and it puts the lives of American servicemen and -women at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrat majority must understand the stakes in Iraq. Certainly, our constituents understand the stakes that are there, both in the terms of human life and global stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would commend <bill type="h" number="511">H.R. 511</bill> to our colleagues for support.</paragraph>
