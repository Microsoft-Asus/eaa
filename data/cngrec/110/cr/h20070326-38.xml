    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in 2004, the United States of America spent $103 billion buying oil from non-democratic countries, such countries as Venezuela, as Iran, as Russia, and even ones who are our allies like Saudi Arabia, where some of that money finds its way into the hands of terrorist groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are funding both sides in the war on terrorism. It is a national security issue. We have to get off Middle East oil, and we need to reduce our oil dependency. We import 60 percent of our oil today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman ELIOT ENGEL and I have introduced <bill type="h" number="670">H.R. 670</bill>. The goal of it is to reduce our oil consumption by 20 percent in 20 years. It has overwhelming bipartisan support, both in the House and the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if you don't buy that, there is another reason to focus on this, and it has to do with your pocketbook. Just think about the flexibility that we have out there in fuel choices, from ethanol to biodiesel to battery operated cars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we need to move in this direction. I recommend <bill type="h" number="670">H.R. 670</bill> to my colleagues and hope they will cosponsor it with me.</paragraph>
