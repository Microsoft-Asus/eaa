  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we were able late last night to work out something on FISA, a 15-day extension. There is a path forward. We are going to try very quickly to get an agreement so that we can move forward. I had a meeting in my office at 6 o'clock last night. Following that meeting, I called the Republican leader, and I think we have a way of moving forward on this legislation, one that would be agreed upon by Senators BOND, ROCKEFELLER, LEAHY, and SPECTER, so that we can  complete that legislation. I think it will probably take a good long day to do that, but I think that would be all it would take.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we can get that done very soon. I do not want to wait. Whatever we do, whether we do something or nothing, I do not want to wait until the last minute. This is something we need to do. I think it would be in everyone's interests to get it to the House as quickly as we can so that we can move forward on a conference to send something to the President that he can review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, we have the stimulus package that we have to deal with, and we are going to do that. That is why I made the announcement last night that we are going to have to do some work on Monday. We are going to have votes on Monday. They won't be early in the day, but we will have votes on Monday. Whatever we are working on, we will try to work Monday so that we can have some votes Monday night, so there will likely be more than one vote Monday night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tuesday, we are going to have to work. We really do need to complete this work on the foreign intelligence legislation quickly. Whatever we do on  the stimulus, we also need to do that quickly. Again, whether we come up with our own package here in the Senate, whether we accept what the House has done, or do nothing, it is not fair to the American people, the other body, and the President not to take action that would be fairly quick, and we are going  to attempt to do that, both dealing with the FISA legislation and the stimulus package.</paragraph>
