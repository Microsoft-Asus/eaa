  <speaking speaker="412213" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, several years ago, my wife and I had the privilege of having a Liberian refugee stay in our home for almost a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This gentleman came from dire circumstances in his homeland, as his wife was brutally assaulted, and he was beaten and forced to leave his country. He still has scars from being beaten with the blunt end of a rifle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like thousands of other Liberians forced to leave their homeland, our  friend came to the United States under temporary protective status. One of the unintended consequences of the temporary protective status is it didn't foresee that civil war would continue in Liberia for several years, leaving refugees in America stuck in a state of flux.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently all Liberian refugees living in the United States under temporary protective status have until October of this year, and then they will be forced to return to Liberia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Liberian Refugee Immigration Protection Act of 2007, a bipartisan bill introduced by Representatives Kennedy, Ellison and myself, would allow Liberians in the United States on temporary protected status the opportunity to apply for permanent residency status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill addresses an urgent situation faced by Liberian refugees who have legally come to America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge co-sponsorship and passage of <bill type="h" number="1941">H.R. 1941</bill>, the Liberian Refugee Immigration Protection Act of 2007.</paragraph>
