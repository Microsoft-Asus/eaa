    <paragraph>Mr. President, I and my colleagues wish to commemorate Cuba Solidarity Day and the struggle of the Cuban people against a constant denial of their basic liberties. Yesterday, we marked the day in 1902 when Cuba won its independence from Spain. Yesterday, we celebrated the birth of their nation; today, we express our hope that the island will experience a new birth of freedom. Today, we express our solidarity with Cuba's political prisoners, democracy advocates, and human rights  activists who risk their lives so that freedom might live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>About 6 months ago I spoke on the Senate floor with my colleague, Senator Martinez, to express outrage that 70 Cuban dissidents were arrested, detained, and harassed. These 70 Cubans, according to the Cuban regime, had committed the crime of peaceful assembly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These young people were simply walking down a street in Havana. And while they were peacefully walking, they had on their arms this wristband. The simple white wristband says one word; "cambio".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, as we have seen for decades from this regime, this denial of a basic liberty was not an isolated incident.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This regime has been marked by fear and repression for decades. For decades, they have denied freedom of press, freedom of speech and freedom to peacefully assemble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have refused to hold free and fair elections which represent the will of the Cuban people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have denied the most basic human rights to its citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But decades of fear and repression have also led to acts of courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I stand here today in solidarity with all of the brave Cubans who have shown such acts of courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, according to Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders, the Cuban regime is holding more than 220 political prisoners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These heroes continue to sacrifice and fight so that one day the Cuban people will finally know freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We in the Senate recently introduced a resolution to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet, in recognition of his courageous and unwavering commitment to democracy, human rights, and peaceful change in Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Biscet's fight serves as an example to all Cubans as well as a source of inspiration for us here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Biscet, the hundreds of political prisoners and all Cubans who live with daily political repression have shown that Cuba will change. And this change will come from the Cuban people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But they need our help. We must continue to fight here to do what we can to empower them. And we must continue to acknowledge them when they empower themselves.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in support of this resolution to recognize Cuba Solidarity Day and the struggle of the Cuban people as they continue to fight for freedom. Cuba Solidarity Day is a call for the world to join together in the fight against oppression in Cuba. It is a way of drawing attention to the injustices faced by the people of Cuba under the current regime and a way of saying that our country stands together with the Cuban people as they work toward democratic change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that it is our country's duty to push for a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba. It is a travesty that, more than a decade after the Cold War ended, a brutal communist dictator is still oppressing people just miles off the coast of Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Cuba continue to be denied the most basic human rights and the freedoms of speech, press, and assembly. It is estimated that more than  220 individuals are being held as political prisoners by the communist regime in Cuba. For the dissidents suffering prison terms, and for their families and loved ones, their suffering is real. And it is our duty as a free nation to let them know that we remember them, that they are not forgotten, and that  their suffering is for a purpose. They must know that the world is watching and that we will not rest and will not tire and will keep working to support them until they are finally free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am reminded of the story that Natan Sharansky tells about his time in the Soviet gulag, when word came that President Reagan had called the Soviet Union an "Evil Empire." For the political prisoners, it was the first sign that they had not been forgotten. It was a signal to them that the leader of the world's most powerful democracy had no illusions about the true nature of that regime, that he knew of their plight and was ready to call the Soviet system what is was--evil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution sends a signal to all the dissidents and political prisoners in Cuba that we have no illusions about the nature of Castro's brother's brutal regime and that we know of their plight and stand ready to help them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I truly believe there is hope. We are witnessing a remarkable time in history as freedom prevails in places that were once rife with oppression. As former Czech Republic President V&#xE1;clav Havel once said, "without free, self-respecting, and autonomous citizens there can be no free and independent nations." It is now time for the world to voice its support of the Cuban people so they too can rise above the injustice of the communist regime and finally achieve the freedom and independence  of a democratic nation.</paragraph>
