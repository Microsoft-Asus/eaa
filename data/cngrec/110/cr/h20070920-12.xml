  <speaking speaker="400647" topic="">
    <paragraph>As one of the original architects of CHIP in Pennsylvania, I have seen firsthand that it is possible to bring together public and private stakeholders and expand health coverage to millions of children, children of working families who cannot afford the increasing cost of coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And now, the Democratic majority is poised to ensure that 10 million uninsured children in this country get the health care they need and deserve. The Democratic majority is delivering on our promise, and I am proud of the work that we have accomplished to expand health care to working families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people understand the importance of getting health care to America's children. 270 organizations representing our Nation's seniors, nurses, unions, businesses have put aside their differences to urge for CHIP reauthorization. American families want and need us to maintain and expand CHIP. Their children are counting on us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next step is for Congress to approve this commonsense, compromise legislation, hopefully with Republican support, and send a strong message to the President to support our efforts towards the goal of insuring every American child.</paragraph>
