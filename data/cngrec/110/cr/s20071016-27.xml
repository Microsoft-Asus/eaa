    <paragraph>Mr. President, each October, the eyes of the world appropriately turn to Des Moines for the presentation of the World Food Prize, called by the former President of Mexico, "the Nobel Prize for Food."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Created by Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, each year on or around October 16--World Food Day--representatives from more than 60 countries gather in the magnificent Iowa State Capitol to honor the newest laureate for his or her exceptional breakthrough achievements in increasing the quality, quantity or availability of food in the world. In past years, this honor has gone to individuals from India, Denmark, Brazil, China, and Sierra Leone. This year the winner is an American from Indiana. But no matter  where they are from, all of these laureates have in common that they have reduced hunger and human suffering around the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is most fitting that this weeklong celebration begins today, October 16 with the first ever Iowa Hunger Summit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are people flying today from the east coast and the west coast to Des Moines. No, they are not Presidential candidates--although there are already plenty of them in the State. Rather, they are national leaders of the Alliance to End Hunger and representatives of the U.N. Foundation, and ambassadors from the United Nations and leaders of the OneVote08 campaign. They are all coming to join hundreds of Iowans to listen to the leaders of Bread for the World and MAZON, the Jewish Response to  Hunger offer an inspiring vision about how to diminish hunger at home and abroad in this inaugural Iowa Hunger Summit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the center of this endeavor will be Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, Iowa's and America's greatest hero in the struggle against hunger. Today is U.N. World Food Day all around the globe. But I would argue, that perhaps the most significant observance of this special day will be taking place in Des Moines, where it is also Dr. Norman E. Borlaug/World Food Prize Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend Iowa's three former Governors, Tom Vilsack, Terry Branstad, and Robert Ray for their bipartisan leadership in making this first ever Iowa Hunger Summit possible. I also express my appreciation to the World Food Prize Foundation for its initiative in starting this new program. Iowa has a rich legacy of coming together above partisan differences when human suffering is involved. Governor Ray has exhibited exemplary leadership of Iowa SHARES to feed emaciated Cambodians, who had  suffered under the genocidal Khmer Rouge. Similarly, Governor Branstad has led Iowa CARES to send food to starving populations in Ethiopia. And here at home, Governor Vilsack has worked in Iowa to greatly expand the number of hungry people receiving assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to add my name to the list of those in support of this marvelous new focus on hunger--the Iowa Hunger Summit. It is most fitting that we in the Congress would also join together in a bipartisan fashion to further commit ourselves to efforts to alleviate malnutrition and human suffering wherever it is found, at home or abroad.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is harvest time in Iowa and throughout heartland. It is the time of year when farmers work around the clock to bring in the year's harvest of corn, soybeans, and other grains. Just this past weekend while on my farm in New Hartford,  I was able to help my son with the harvest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Across Iowa and the Midwest, farmers are harvesting a bumper crop. It is during this time that we pray that these bounties from the land make their way into of the mouths of the hungry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is appropriate, then, that during this season of harvest, a gathering will be taking place in northeast Iowa focusing on global hunger. Not far from my farm, a dinner is taking place tonight in the small town of Protivin, to honor one of America's greatest fighters of hunger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Norman Borlaug, who grew up just a few miles from Protivin in Howard County, shared his talents to help populations around the world. His efforts to increase food production, and alleviate global hunger and famine earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 and the title of "Father of the Green Revolution."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His work in food production was also acknowledged this summer when Dr. Borlaug was presented the Congressional Gold Medal by President Bush and the bipartisan leadership of Congress. As a testament to his work around the globe, officials from Mexico, India, Japan, and numerous countries in Africa were present to honor Dr. Borlaug. I was proud to join this distinguished group in honoring him, and I thank my colleagues for acknowledging Dr. Borlaug's accomplishments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear that Dr. Borlaug has never forgotten his roots. He remains a rural Iowa farmer at heart. That is why I am sure tonight's dinner near his hometown will mean as much as, if not more than, the formal banquet that followed his receiving the Nobel Peace Prize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also appropriate that Dr. Borlaug is making this trip back to the heartland today, October 16. Today has been designated "World Food Day" around the globe, and "Dr. Norman E. Borlaug/World Food Prize Day" in Iowa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Borlaug continues to lead the effort to end global hunger and will do so today by participating in the first Iowa Hunger Summit in Des Moines. This summit will bring together people from across Iowa and the country to focus on feeding the hungry at home and abroad. Iowa Governor Chet Culver and former Governors Vilsack, Branstad, and Ray will also be in attendance for the summit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the World Food Prize Foundation which provided the leadership in making this daylong focus on hunger possible. The foundation has worked closely with the Alliance to End Hunger, the One Campaign, and Iowa State University to make this event a central focus of World Food Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an appropriate time of year for us to focus on hunger and feeding the malnourished worldwide. I hope my colleagues will join in commending those who are working daily to raise the awareness of world hunger and working to provide adequate food for all.</paragraph>
