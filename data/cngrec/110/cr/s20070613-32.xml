    <paragraph>Madam President, today I wish to recognize Keith and Patti Jennings as they celebrate their ranch's 100-year anniversary. The Jennings family has the unique distinction of being one of the few functioning farm and ranch operations able to trace their roots back to family members who were the original homesteaders on the land. This is a truly impressive accomplishment for the Jennings family and the State of South Dakota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This milestone celebration is a tribute not only to Keith and Patti Jennings but to their grandparents Robert and Lucille and their parents Darrell and Mary. The family can certainly take pride in the perseverance and fortitude that enabled three generations of Jennings to stay on and operate the same ranch for the past 100 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Keith and Patti Jennings should also be very proud of the contributions their children are making to the great State of South Dakota, Brian as executive director of the American Coalition for Ethanol, Barry as executive director of the South Dakota Beef Industry Council, Marla with the construction industry in Sioux Falls, and Byron as a student at South Dakota State University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to commend Keith and Patti for their 32 years operating the Jennings Ranch and for its 100 years of operation. South Dakota is fortunate to have the Jennings as lifelong residents. Families like theirs are the backbone of South Dakota's economy and future. I wish them continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
