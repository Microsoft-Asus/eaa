    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <chair>The amendment is as follows:</chair>
  <chair>AMENDMENT NO. 3437&lt;center&gt;(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to modify certain HIV/AIDS funding formulas)&lt;/center&gt;</chair>
  <chair>At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:</chair>
  <chair>SEC.  __. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no funds shall be made available under this Act to modify the HIV/AIDS funding formulas under title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, at the present time, the last numbers that I saw, Congress's approval rating was 12 percent. There is a reason for that. We have been nibbling around the edges on a lot of things, and we have been doing earmarks. I have an amendment that deals with one of the most egregious earmarks I have seen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Less than a year ago we passed a bill in this body unanimously, that the House then passed unanimously, that addressed the Ryan White AIDS program, and it included transparency, it included accountability, and it included a change in the formula. The change in the formula gave some protection to those who have had a declining population, but it allowed the money to follow the people who had the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, in this bill, there is an earmark that provides for money now to go to people who may no longer even exist--people who are dead. It is a way that they are trying to change the authorization process we went through so meticulously, so unanimously, in such a way that it undoes it in an appropriations bill. We shouldn't be changing law in an appropriations bill. We especially shouldn't be changing law for a specific area of the country in an appropriations bill. That is why I bring this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to discuss the Ryan White program and the need to ensure that this Labor-HHS bill does not undo our recent work. Last December, after months of negotiations, the House and the Senate passed a new 3-year Ryan White reauthorization. Most importantly, we ensured that those new formulas focused on the lifesaving treatment by including individuals with HIV, not just AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the key items that delayed this reauthorization for months was the careful negotiations surrounding the funding formulas. In that bipartisan, bicameral agreement, we were very clear about the implications of those new formula changes. We provided GAO data runs that were nearly identical to how the funding has been distributed. I hope everybody takes a look at those GAO data runs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those funding formulas also included hold-harmless provisions to ensure the formula funding would not decrease by more than 5 percent from the previous year. While I would have preferred no hold-harmless provisions or ones that allowed for more dramatic fluctuations so the money could follow the HIV-infected person, that was what we agreed upon a few short months ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We didn't pull the wool over anyone's eyes; we provided clear information about the implications about those funding formulas. Now, with one simple pen stroke, the House majority would like to undo all of those carefully crafted, bipartisan, bicameral compromises and insert a new hold-harmless provision with little thought to how this change will affect others. I am pleased to note that the Senate did not include this egregious provision, and I hope today the Senate will go on record for opposing  doing so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is even more ridiculous is that this provision primarily benefits San Francisco, a city that continues to receive funding to care for dead people. San Francisco received two-thirds of the $9 million available, racking up $6 million of new dollars. All the while, nearly every other city would have reduced funding just so San Francisco can receive more riches. That additional $6 million is not based on the number of people they are treating or on how many new cases they have. As a hold-harmless  provision, it is related to what that city has received before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As GAO noted in the report last month, even within their current funding, they are receiving money for people who have died. Let me repeat that. GAO, the Government Accountability Office, confirmed that San Francisco currently receives funding under Ryan White for dead people. That is without this additional $6 million earmark. Now, I don't know about my colleagues, but I find this a little reprehensible. Where I come from, that is called cheating. This is patently unfair to those cities and  States that are striving to come up with the moneys for basic HIV/AIDS treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Democrats reneged on a bipartisan, bicameral solution and are trying to slide this authorizing legislation into an appropriations bill, hoping no one will notice. Well, I noticed. I object to this provision and the implications of it. Rather than providing nearly $10 million to help those cities that don't need it, why aren't we providing funds to those cities with large numbers of people with HIV?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I offer my amendment to Labor-HHS, Enzi amendment No. 3437. This amendment is quite simple. It states that the Labor-HHS bill cannot be used to undo all of the work we did on Ryan White. We should not be diverting key funds from cities with rising HIV cases to go to San Francisco--a city that is still receiving funds for treating people who have already died from AIDS. If you support keeping people alive, I believe you should also support my amendment. We did last December. We should again.  We need to keep it on track to take care of the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield some time to my fellow Senator from Oklahoma, such time as he would like.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments about what is in the bill and what is going to happen if we don't accept Senator Enzi's amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we crafted the Ryan White Act, the goal was to make sure the dollars followed the disease and to make sure people who were infected with HIV who had no other means of seeking treatment and having a life that is not the scourge of this disease with the modern medicines that have come about, to create a platform where we could have fair availability for medicines and treatment and care to where the disease is growing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What has come out of the House, with Speaker Pelosi's direction, is to actually take money from African-American women and the medicines they need to stay alive, or medicines to treat their newborn infants, and send it to San Francisco, which in the last few years has not even spent the entire amount of money that has gone to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Enzi is right in the fact that this violates the very agreement we made over a long period of time to get Ryan White funds to start following the disease. By taking an extra $6.2 million and sending it to San Francisco, it violates, No. 1, the agreement on that bill, but most importantly, it takes away the opportunity for health for minority women, which is where the disease is growing the greatest amount. We have all these women throughout the country who have been on waiting  lists for drugs for treatment. They are getting some, but they are not getting what is going to save their lives. And we are going to steal that opportunity for minority women to be adequately and fairly treated under this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ryan White bill we passed last year was a good compromise, knowing that we needed to shift money to where the disease is. What happened in the House bill is we have actually reneged on that commitment. What we are actually saying is that the establishment age groups in northern California deserve more money than a single African-American woman who was infected with HIV and cannot get the medicines to treat her disease. That is the choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the first time, the Ryan White Act changed the direction of where the money went. The Ryan White Act, as we passed it, had the money following the disease, going to those who need treatment rather than to established organizations that are used to a certain budget. So the tragedy will be that if we don't pass the Enzi amendment, we are taking a step backward from the very principle--a public health principle, by the way--that you put the money where the epidemic is. What is in the House bill  negates that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are doing is playing politics with the lives of African-American women, who are the fastest growing numbers of people who have HIV in this country. We are taking $6.2 million away from them and we are putting it in facilities that, quite frankly, have done quite well under the Ryan White Act. The availability, the access, and the programs are at the greatest level in San Francisco as compared to any other place in this country. Yet we choose, if we do not accept the Enzi amendment, to  say that is a higher priority than a poor African-American woman in the South. That is the choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support this amendment. I think the Senate, in good conscience, ought to live up to its agreement on the Ryan White Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from California is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Enzi amendment. I congratulate the chairman and the ranking member for the work they have done on this bill. But this amendment significantly disadvantages at least nine jurisdictions facing HIV/AIDS crises throughout the country because it essentially would prevent any stop-loss provision enacted by the House from going into effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Enzi, Senator Kennedy, and the rest of the HELP Committee worked tirelessly for most of last year to reauthorize the Ryan White CARE Act. I voted for this reauthorization, and I recognized at the time that the method of counting HIV/AIDS victims had to change to more clearly reflect living victims. However, this then mandated huge cuts to vital programs, despite the fact that States and eligible metropolitan areas were assured that no jurisdiction would face destabilizing  losses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The HELP Committee staff provided GAO data during the debate projecting that San Francisco would receive approximately $17.1 million in fiscal year 2007. But San Francisco did not receive that amount. Their formula award totaled $14.6 million, which is $2.5 million less than estimated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A compromise was to offset losses by clearly making available supplemental award funding so that the Health Resources and Services Administration could consider the funding losses when awarding this supplemental funding. This amendment seeks to do away with all of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these estimates and built-in protection, several areas of the country received significant funding cuts when the 2007 awards were announced earlier this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The San Francisco eligible metropolitan areas, which also include Marin and San Mateo Counties, lost approximately $8.5 million. That is just those three counties--an $8.5 million loss. This accounts for 30 percent of the Ryan White funding--a loss too great for any jurisdiction to absorb in 1 year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It didn't surprise me when San Francisco lost money in 2007. The city knew it would likely face losses. But the protections put in place clearly were not adequate. The loss of one-third of total funding is clearly destabilizing. To be very candid with you, I find it highly objectionable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This isn't only unique for San Francisco. Five other cities also lost 20 percent or more of their funding: Hartford, CT, 32.1 percent; New Haven, CT, 23.7 percent; Nassau-Suffolk County, NY, 21.7 percent; Ponce, Puerto Rico, 28.9 percent; Caguas, Puerto Rico, 34.3 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No jurisdiction can absorb cuts of this magnitude in 1 year without significant harm to those they serve. To address this, the House of Representatives included a stop-loss provision to cap the losses faced by these jurisdictions in their version of the fiscal year 2008 Labor-HHS appropriations bill. This provision limits the fiscal year 2007 losses for eligible metropolitan areas, or EMAs, to 8.4 percent--not 30 percent but 8.4 percent--which is a manageable amount. Transitional grant areas  will have their losses capped at 13.4 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So there is a willingness to respond to the mandate; that is, change your method of counting and, secondly, absorb reasonable cuts. I don't think that  is too much to ask. I think this is overkill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was the mayor who first found AIDS, and I can take you back to 1981 and I can tell you what it was like. You won't like it. What I tried to do in the task force of the Conference of Mayors was to bring mayors into the modern day. San Francisco essentially led the Nation in the fight against AIDS. I think to have to take a 30-percent cut, when we are seeing some regeneration of AIDS, is a terrible mistake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Enzi's amendment could nullify the House's solution. Let me be clear. Under the House language, San Francisco would still lose $2.3  million. All of the cities will still face significant cuts. This provision is designed not to stop all reductions but to limit them to a level that can be absorbed in 1 year. The House provided funding for the stop-loss on top of a $23 million increase for part A of the Ryan White CARE Act. So virtually every area across the country sees an increase in funding. But these areas take a dramatic 30-percent cut in funding. I don't think that is right, and I don't believe we should accept it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Government Accountability Office examined the impact this stop-loss provision would have on jurisdictions in 2008. In addition to benefiting the 11 jurisdictions whose cuts are reduced, the House bill results in increased funding for 42 of the remaining 45 jurisdictions. The very minor cuts projected in the remaining three jurisdictions are less than one-tenth of 1 percent. A reduction of 30-percent is simply not manageable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provision makes no changes to the underlying reauthorization. It doesn't prevent it from moving forward at all. It caps the total losses faced by any jurisdiction in fiscal year 2007 with a one-time solution. It doesn't reopen the reauthorization so carefully crafted by Senators KENNEDY and ENZI and their committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The epidemic, as I mentioned, is far from over in San Francisco. AIDS continues to be the second leading cause of premature death in the city and counting. Nearly 23,000 people are currently living with HIV/AIDS in San Francisco, which is more than at any point in the epidemic. Listen to that--nearly 23,000 people in San Francisco are living with HIV now, and that is more than at any point during the epidemic. In addition, the population of San Francisco living with HIV/AIDS is increasingly impoverished,  homeless, and struggling. Many have serious medical needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>About 2 weeks ago, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that San Francisco doctors diagnosed 15 HIV patients with Kaposi sarcoma. That is a form of cancer commonly found in patients early in the epidemic but had become rare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will never forget, in a staff meeting I had with department heads back in 1981, when the director of public health said: Madam Mayor, something is happening. We are finding patients with large purple lesions all over their bodies, and we don't know what it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His name is Merv Silverman. I said: Merv, find out what it is and come back and tell me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Three weeks later, they came back, and it was the discovery for the first time of AIDS in this country. So I feel very sensitive about it. I started the first AIDS program in the Nation. We funded it with property tax dollars. That is how we became a leader in the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To take a 30-percent cut when we have the largest number of HIV/AIDS victims in our history in the city, to me, is discriminatory, wrongheaded, and it need not happen. So I very much hope this body will respond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand Senator Enzi wants to protect the reauthorization and the funding formula he authored, but I think we have to admit that the impact on some areas of the country was not anticipated. Fixing these unintended consequences does not require reopening the legislation. It can be addressed with a one-time solution that will still leave some cities with a decline in funds; that means the House solution of stop-loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the Enzi amendment, which would strike a dastardly blow to a city that has seen too much suffering, as well as others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the chair and yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> Who yields time?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300040" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of points.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know this is a large step down for San Francisco EMA and a smaller step down for some of the others. But the thing that needs to be kept in mind is the amount of dollars spent per HIV patient in those areas is 2 1/2  times what the average is around the rest of the country--2 1/2  times. We spend 2 1/2  times more per HIV case in those areas than we do in North Carolina or Florida or Mississippi or Michigan or Kansas or Texas or Arizona. So what we are talking about is proportionality; giving  the same opportunities to everybody who has HIV, not more opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with the 30-percent cut, you are still going to be spending 1 1/2  to 1 3/4  times more per HIV case in San Francisco as you are in the rest of the country. So I appreciate the work of the Senator in the HIV area, which is exemplary, and I understand she would want to protect this, but it is not fair to the rest of the country. It is not fair to tell somebody that you are going to spend 2 1/2  times as much on somebody with HIV in San Francisco as you are in Dallas, TX, or Miami, FL. That  is what this amendment is about--keeping the fairness that was in the Ryan White Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from California.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I don't think it is fair to take a 30-percent cut in 1 year when you have the largest number of HIV/AIDS victims in the history of the epidemic in a city that has suffered such as no other city in America. I am not saying there shouldn't be cuts. I voted for the reauthorization knowing there would be cuts. What I am talking about is the level of cuts and the way these cuts fall because they decimate programs in an area that was ground zero on AIDS in the United  States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you are going to take cuts, take those cuts so the communities involved in fighting HIV with prevention, with education, with care, with treatment, with drugs, with all of it, can essentially meet the mandate, which is to prevent the suffering of AIDS in HIV patients and also to prevent the disease from spreading. That is not easy to do, I can tell you that firsthand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You take a 30-percent cut in 1 year and you decimate these programs. That is why the House put the stop-loss in. Take a moderate cut, and we will stand up like men and women and we will take that cut. Take a third cut and it is much more difficult and you affect services to people. That is all I am saying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would very much hope the Senate would understand the need and the compassion to defeat this amendment and, once again, I would urge a "no" vote.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, before we passed the legislation, there were waiting lines in many of the States in this country, lines of people waiting to get treatment and care for AIDS. I am pleased to let you know there are no waiting lines today. No waiting lines anywhere--not in San Francisco, not in Connecticut, not in New Jersey or in New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been a cut. The cut is guaranteed to be no more than 5 percent under the formula. Now, there has always been supplemental money besides the formula. We did not guarantee the supplemental money. The supplemental money was never guaranteed. And if there are larger cuts, it comes out of the supplemental money, not the formula. So I certainly hope we don't change the formula under the appropriations bill instead of through the proper process, which is authorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the Department of Health and Human Services in North Carolina with some very pertinent quotes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,</narrative>
  <narrative>October 15, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR ENZI: Thanks to your leadership on the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), Congress took an important step last year and  modernized the Ryan White CARE Act (RWCA). You and many of your congressional colleagues--both Democrats and Republicans--took a principled stance in order to ensure that patients in need, no matter where they live, can access basic medical services to treat and prevent HIV.</narrative>
  <narrative>The new Ryan White program funding is having a profound impact in North Carolina. The increase in North Carolina's AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) eligibility from 125% to 250% over the past two years is the direct result of your legislative initiative, resources provided by the new Ryan White funding and new state investments. The increased eligibility levels will result in approximately 600-750 new North Carolinians having access to ADAP services. The reforms you championed are making a  crucial difference in the lives of people living with HIV.</narrative>
  <narrative>Unfortunately, an effort is underway in the Congress to modify the original intent of the reauthorization--that funding would be based on demonstrated need. As you are aware, according to a Health Resources Services Agency document and the newly-released GAO report that you and your colleagues requested, the impact of the House-passed version of the FY2008 Labor-HHS Appropriations bill that would cap losses for certain EMAs would result in decreased funding for states that would have otherwise  received new funding based on higher incidence of HIV.</narrative>
  <narrative>As a direct result of your efforts last year, North Carolina and other parts of the country that have been hit hardest by new HIV cases now have a fighting chance to effectively increase HIV screening, link infected individuals to care and reduce the number of HIV infections reported from year-to-year. If this attempt to undermine the basic premise of the landmark Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006 is successful, CARE Act funding will be diverted from regions of the country  that are most in need of federal assistance. Unless the harmful provision in the appropriations legislation is eliminated, I am gravely concerned for patients who are in desperate need of lifesaving medical care, individuals who will be newly infected because their partners did not have access to CARE Act services and ultimately, the future prospects of addressing the HIV epidemic in North Carolina and throughout the country.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you for your leadership on the Health Subcommittee, and thank you for your attention to this important issue.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, in listening to this debate and having received a letter from the Speaker, the concerns I have are whether there was a disproportionate share going to some localities in California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I could direct a question to the Senator from California: What is your response to the concerns raised by the Senator from Wyoming that the formula was settled last year and that this, in effect, reopens the formula and is going to direct funds to areas in your State where those funds could be directed to the same serious problem which Pennsylvania has in our big cities--Pittsburgh and Philadelphia?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you could first respond on the issue as to whether the formula was resolved last year.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="NORTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT">
    <paragraph>Through the Chair, Mr. President, if I may, to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, first of all, it is my knowledge that the cut to San Francisco and to 11 other jurisdictions is very large. With respect to the reauthorization of Ryan White, we do not agree that it applies only to the fiscal year 2007 cuts. It takes resources, actually, from other jurisdictions. The Pelosi fix in the House ensures a significant increase for title I that would both reduce cuts to a manageable  level for 11 jurisdictions and still increase for other jurisdictions. So this isn't taking money away from other jurisdictions, as I understand it. The provisions in the House bill increases funding for 42 of the remaining 45 jurisdictions under title I.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I don't know the particulars, to be candid with you, of how these cuts fell, but I do know the cut received in the Bay Area was substantial. I suspect it was from the way they counted AIDS cases, and they knew they had to change the methodology. But basically the point is the cut is substantially large and means you have to cut 30 percent across the board of AIDS programs at a time when San Francisco has the largest number of HIV/AIDS cases in its history--23,000.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The problem is one of enormous seriousness, and it is very difficult to find the funding with what we have allocated on our discretionary spending. In a context where some $36 million is being added in the House bill and some $6 million has been allocated to San Francisco in the House bill--and I am very sympathetic to San Francisco's problem and I understand the distinguished Senator from California was mayor of San Francisco and it is within the district of the Speaker of the House,  so I understand their interest there--what I am trying to evaluate is whether there is undue funding going because of the prominence of the advocates of the position by the Senator from California.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement entered into last night, I believe the Senator from South Carolina would be recognized next for amendment No. 3387, with 20 minutes of debate equally divided.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the consideration of the Roberts amendment first, and then we would, after the disposal of the Roberts amendment, then proceed to the DeMint amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300083" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in support of the Roberts amendment, No. 3365, to fund a small business childcare grant program. The program was authorized earlier this year as part of the supplemental spending bill. It does have wide bipartisan support at this time, as well as last Congress when it was unanimously approved by the HELP Committee as part of the Child Care Community Development Block Grant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program is different from other childcare initiatives because it specifically targets small businesses and because it encourages them to work together. These small businesses are the lifeblood of many urban and rural communities. These grants will allow the local convenience store or the beauty shop, the auto shop, the implement dealer, the bank, to cooperatively work together to offer their employees quality childcare while they work. Right now, these daycare facilities are simply not available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My program is also different from other grants because it encourages sustainability and ownership over these childcare facilities. With an annual increasing match requirement and a 2012 sunset provision, my program offers a fiscally responsible approach to plugging the lack of childcare for many hard-working American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to thank Senators SPECTER, HARKIN, KENNEDY, DODD, and SALAZAR  for their support of this program in the supplemental spending bill. I am proud this was a bipartisan effort from the get-go, and I want that to continue. If you support hard-working American families, if you support small business and community development, if you support fiscal responsibility, then simply support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say I recognize and appreciate the concern of my good friends and colleagues, Senators COBURN and DEMINT. They feel this program could be duplicative. I do not think it is because the program targets small businesses and encourages them to cooperate with other entities to develop sustainable childcare facilities. Because of the matching and sunset requirements--50 percent the first year here, 67 percent the second year, and the third year, 75 percent, and then it sunsets--I  think we are much more fiscally responsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was a suggestion to use TANF funds. These are being held by States in emergency contingency accounts in case of a sudden economic downturn. This would be another allowable use of these funds. That is not the case. This is apples and oranges. This is a fiscally responsible plan on the part of the States and we should encourage that.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield myself about 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment offered by Senator Roberts is a good amendment. This was authorized in the emergency supplemental bill for fiscal year 2007. The grants are for small businesses that want to partner with each other or other organizations to establish employer-owned childcare programs. Funds can be used for startup costs, technical assistance, and training and special services for sick kids or children with disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The program is authorized at $50 million in fiscal year 2008. As the Senator said, funding was not included. I think it is time we do fund it. I have long been a supporter of expanding the role of small businesses in providing the kind of childcare that their employees need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the amendment of the Senator will further that goal, and I offer my support to the Senator's amendment and I hope the Senate will adopt it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I do want to make sure we have called up amendment No. 3387. I appreciate the chairman agreeing to this slight change in the purpose statement, not the legislative language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is part of an effort to clear up what a lot of us have called the culture of corruption over the last several years. A lot of this has come from Americans connecting the dots between the earmarks that we give to our favorite causes back home and many of the campaign contributions and political support that we get back here in Congress. While motivations are generally good, at best the appearance of what is going on here has alarmed the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My earmark amendment today addresses two specific earmarks in the appropriations bill that is in front of us. One of the earmarks provides $1.5 million for the AFL-CIO Working for America Institute and $2.2 million for the AFL-CIO Appalachian Council. These funds come in the form of what are referred to as noncompetitive grants, according to the text of the bill and the committee report--which means no one else can compete to deliver the services that are intended by the bill, that these are  a specific earmark to divisions of the AFL-CIO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These earmarks are problematic because they fund two organizations that are not competitive. They provide funds that could be better spent to achieve the mission of the Department of Labor set out by Congress in the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. Rather than continuing to give these groups handouts without any competition, we should force them to compete with other organizations so Americans get the most value for their tax dollars. That is exactly what my amendment will do. It replaces these  two earmarks that total $3.7 million with competitive grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear. I am not taking the money out of the bill. The money is still there for the purposes for which it is intended, but it allows organizations to compete to deliver these services so that the taxpayers get the most for their money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say a few things about the performance of the AFL-CIO organization so my colleagues understand why there is such concern. The AFL-CIO Working for America Institute originally received grants under the Workforce Investment Act. The grants were given to national organizations for the purpose of providing technical assistance in setting up systems of local and State workforce investment boards for the purpose of helping unemployed workers get the training and the jobs they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After 3 years, these capacity-building services were no longer needed, and the grants were terminated. However, the Working for America Institute failed to complete its mission in 3 years, so the Department gave it a fourth year of funding. After the fourth year, the Department terminated its contract with the Working for America Institute and explained:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is difficult to make the case that the AFL-CIO should receive yet a fifth year of funding for organizational purposes when the other national organizations were able to achieve their goals in 3 years. Additionally, given that there are so many workers seeking training or retraining opportunities, we believe the Department of Labor's emphasis is rightly placed on promoting employment and reemployment projects having measurable outcomes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department believes the technical assistance given by the institute is duplicative and less effective than a similar program already funded in their Employment and Training Administration. It said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should focus limited financial resources on programs that deliver actual training services to workers, rather than pour additional funds into organizational infrastructure. After 4 years, the AFL-CIO should have developed sufficient ability to participate effectively in the Workforce Investment Act system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these failures, Congress overrode the Department and earmarked funds for $1.5 million in fiscal year 2005 in the appropriations bill in that year, and it continued the project through June of this year. Now this appropriations bill is trying to do the same thing again. This is a clear example of Congress interfering with agency decisions because of parochial or political interests. Congress should not fund a program that is duplicative and not a critical priority for an agency. It should  have to compete for funds like every other organization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me address the second earmark in this bill. The AFL-CIO Appalachian Council had a longstanding sole-source  contract with the Department of Labor that spanned several decades. The purpose of the contract was to provide career technical training and career transition services at job placement centers in Pittsburgh, PA, Charleston, WV, and Batesville, MS. It is important to note that the council does not manage or run these three centers. It simply  provides the training, placement, and transition services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Labor reviewed the council's performance in 2004 in light of the new requirements of the Workforce Investment Act. The review resulted in the Department terminating the council's sole-source contract because it was no longer the only and unique provider of career transition services and because it experienced a steady decline in program performance over a 5-year period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these failures, Congress stepped in and earmarked $2.2 million for the council in fiscal year 2005, forcing the Department to continue the contract. Following this, the Department canceled the contract again, but Congress reversed the agency's decision a second time with another $2.2 million earmark in 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the second year came to a close, the Department reviewed the performance outcomes of the council. In 2006, the council placed 265 graduates in apprenticeship programs and 71 graduates in jobs matching their vocational training. With the earmark funded at $2.2 million, the cost of each of these graduates was $6,547. Each of the council's 21 staff members placed less than 2 students per month in a registered apprenticeship program. Despite being given a second chance by Congress, the Department  terminated the contract again this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the appropriations bill we are considering gives another earmark to the council to continue the services and designates it a noncompeting earmark, which means no one else can compete to do the service right. Here we have two examples of earmarks that circumvent the normal competitive process and abuse the American taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The AFL-CIO has plenty of funds to continue these  programs. In 2006, the AFL-CIO reported $96 million in assets and $157.2 million in receipts. Their top five executive officers made from $179,000 to $291,000 a year, with 204 employees making more than $75,000 a year. Of their disbursements, about $30 million, or nearly 40 percent of their total receipts, went for political activities and lobbying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The AFL-CIO should either fund the program itself or help the institute develop a competitive grant proposal, but these organizations should not get a handout. My amendment, as I said before, does not eliminate the funds, but it does require the AFL-CIO to compete based on real criteria and accountability to deliver the services for the American taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to turn these noncompetitive grants into competitive grants so we accomplish the purpose in an accountable way. I ask my colleagues to vote for my amendment later on this morning. I appreciate their support.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>How much time do we have, Mr. President?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> There is 10 minutes in opposition. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the two programs which have been commented on by the Senator from South Carolina are very good programs, contrary to his assertions. The AFL-CIO Appalachian Council is a nationally recognized provider of educational training service. It was founded in 1964 and the council has represented Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, DC, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. I believe if the Senator from South  Carolina looked closely at what has happened in his own State, which has been a beneficiary, he would find it has been a good program. The council operates major employment and training programs through the Department of Labor and Job Corps, as well as employee assistance programs, and provides funding for recruitment/replacement of some 1,000 Job Corps students in long-term jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you talk about the Job Corps, you are talking about a group of young people who might well be at risk. With the rising rates of violence in major American cities--two of them in my State, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia; Philadelphia had 406 homicides last year--taking some of these at-risk students off the streets, young people off the streets, and providing job training is very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Working for America Institute, which is a program very near and dear to the heart of the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, has an important retraining component of our manufacturing base, where we have seen too many high-paying jobs shipped overseas. During the current administration, more than 3 million American manufacturing jobs have been lost. We are dealing with an area of some of the Rust Belt States where job training and job development is very important and the  Appalachian Council runs through those States and provides a very important service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Senator from South Carolina talks about a political factor, that depends upon the eye of the beholder. These programs have worked very well. They are a very modest allocation with a total of $3.7 million tackling an issue of job training in an area which has been beset by unfair foreign competition. They have been very carefully considered by the subcommittee, very carefully considered by the full committee, and they have been a part of the budget for a considerable period of time. They  have established their bona fides and their worthwhile nature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe they are worth the money. I urge my colleagues to reject the DeMint amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to my distinguished colleague from Iowa.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Iowa.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>I wish to join with Senator Specter in opposing the DeMint amendment, which would strike two congressionally directed fundings in the bill--one for the Appalachian Council, and the other one would be for the Working for America Institute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This institute was created, first of all, in 1989 and then in 1998 was spun off and made into a totally separate nonprofit organization with a functioning board of directors and everything else. They have over 30 years of experience in the field of job training, workforce development. They work with businesses, the private sector, they work with unions, and they work with communities. The institute has basically been a showcase of how to pull people together and get people together for workforce  development. It is doing great work, and it benefits communities throughout the United States. In fact, I had the list of some here. Just last year alone, the institute provided assistance to Portland, OR, the Ohio State Workforce Board, the National Governors Association, and the National Alliance of Workforce Boards. So you can see they do things all over the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I point out that this institute received funding through the Department of Labor for over 30 years, through Republican and Democratic administrations. I can go back to Nixon and Ford and Carter, all through the Reagan years, the first Bush administration, the Clinton administration, and actually the first part of this Bush administration until just a couple of years ago when the Department of Labor decided to cut all funding for it. So we had to come in here a couple of years ago and put directed  funding in there for the institute. It was widely supported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when the Senator from South Carolina says that: Well, we will just make it competitive. Well, the Department will not do it anyway. They are not interested in it. They will not put it out for competitive grant. So this is another instance where I think congressionally directed funding has validity because we have looked at these programs from a bipartisan standpoint, and we agree they should be funded, even though the Department of Labor does not want the funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the second issue I wanted to address is--I do not know whether I caught the Senator from South Carolina correctly, but I heard something about lobbying and political activity. I just wanted to make it very clear that section 503 of the bill reads--and I will read it in its entirety:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall be used, other than for normal  and recognized executive-legislative relationships, for publicity or propaganda purposes, for the preparation, distribution or use of any kit, pamphlet, booklet, publication, radio, television or video presentation, designed to support or defeat legislation pending before the Congress or any State legislature, except in presentation to the Congress or any State legislature  itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>B. No part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall be used to pay the salary or expenses of any grant or contract recipient or agent acting for such recipient related to any activity designed to influence legislation or appropriations pending before the Congress or any State legislature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the recipients cannot do it, and they cannot hire lobbyists, either, to lobby for them for any legislation pending before the Congress. So I wanted to make it clear that none of this money can be used for lobbying or for any kind of partisan activities, nor can it even be used for them to hire a lobbyist or a lobbying firm for that activity. So I wanted to make that clear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the Senator from Pennsylvania. The Appalachian Council has done a great job. They are doing great work in a number of States. The Working for America Institute, again, is one that has proven its worth. It has been widely supported throughout America, through business concerns, and State workforce investment boards all over this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now is not the time to pull the rug out from underneath them. So I would join with Senator Specter in opposing the DeMint amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, just a supplemental comment or two. The Job Corps program, which is part of this overall operation, funds young people ages 16 through 24. In Philadelphia, there is a program which places graduates with 61 major health care employers in higher skill jobs which are in great demand in Philadelphia. That attacks an area of great importance, considering the homicide rate in Philadelphia, much of which is caused by young people, so many at-risk youth. This goes right to  the heart of a very serious problem, to support the funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to supplement that, too, with the hearing which we held on July 22, 2004, where we had extensive testimony taken on the subject to establish the value of the program.</paragraph>

When you have somebody like the AFL-CIO, which has so much knowledge, and so many of their experts are at work on this program, it makes very good sense to give the opportunity to carry out the program. It is all subject to the review by the Department of Labor. I think the quality of this program speaks  for itself. There is agreement on it. It has an important purpose.

    <paragraph>Mr. President, amendment No. 3358 is a pending amendment we discussed this last Friday. I believe under the unanimous consent agreement I have 10 minutes, and those in opposition do also. I am going to speak a few moments, if I may.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the country is looking for us to do is to choose priorities, to make good choices about the priorities of what we do with their money. Quite frankly, there has not been a top-down review on all the Government programs, ever. We have had very limited oversight hearings, which should be the No. 1 part of our job. And we have in front of us a bill that has $400 million in directed earmarks, which we think, through what the appropriations process has brought to us, is an important priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this amendment says is that we are going to give the Members of the Senate an opportunity to vote on whether those are the most important priorities or whether we ought to have children's health care because what this amendment does is redirects this money in abeyance until we say we have the kids in this country covered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a large debate over the SCHIP bill that the President recently vetoed. There are a lot of things wrong with it. It is not wrong to help poor kids get health care. Nobody in the Senate opposed that. What they did oppose is changing, under the guise of a debate for children, a debate of having the Government start running all of the health care for kids. What it did do is spend $4,000 to buy $2,300 worth of care, and a lot of other things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what this amendment is about is asking the Senate to choose--choose your directed earmarks for back home or make a statement that says: We really believe kids health care is important, and we are not going to spend the money on directed earmarks until we have solved that problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know this makes some of my colleagues bristle, that we would challenge the direction. This is not saying specific earmarks are not good ideas. A lot of the earmarks in this bill are good ideas. What it does say is: Should they be a priority before we take care of one of the greatest problems this country is facing, which is health care? Are we going to go after and really change health care to where we get value, we get controllable costs, we get freedom of choice, or are we going to continue  to do the same thing of putting earmarks into bills and ignoring the big problems that are in front of us?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what this amendment says is that until the Secretary of HHS, whoever they may be, certifies that we have the kids under 18 in this country covered, we should not be spending money on directed political benefits for ourselves and our careers; instead, we should be spending our time solving the health care needs of the kids in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the remainder of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Who yields time in opposition? The Senator from Iowa.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I assume it comes as no surprise that I oppose the amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate that the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma raises again the issue of children's health care. I think that debate should go on since the plight of poor children in this country needs as much attention as we can give it. But I do not think this amendment is serious about addressing the health of children. The amendment does not put any money into it at all; it just says that we will not have any congressionally directed funding until every child in America has health care coverage.  I believe that is the way it is worded. So it really does not fund it. It does not do anything at all. I think it is the kind of thing that kind of gives Congress a bad name in that we say we  want to do these things, but we do not provide any funding for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We really already know how to increase the number of children insured in this country--by providing an increase in the SCHIP bill program. The Senate recently voted 68 to 31 to do that--68 to 31, pretty overwhelming. That bill would have provided insurance to millions of children who do not have any. Well, maybe the Senator from Oklahoma did not agree with how that was done but, nonetheless, 68 Senators did agree on both sides of the aisle on that approach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, again, if the Senator was really concerned about the plight of these children, I would suggest that rather then voting against the SCHIP bill, which obviously provides some guidance and direction, that there is another way of doing it. Again, I point out that the Senate voted overwhelmingly to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That vote on SCHIP was a key one on children's health insurance, not a completely unrelated vote dealing with congressionally directed spending, which is what this is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my friend from Oklahoma, if he wants more kids to have health insurance, then vote for a bill that would provide more health insurance to kids. If it is not the SCHIP bill, then what is it? It has been suggested that maybe a vote for the Coburn amendment might be a nice cover vote for those who oppose the SCHIP bill. I don't think so. Perhaps more and more people are finding out that a vote against the SCHIP bill was not a very popular one, as we hear from communities and States. But  an amendment such as this doesn't change the facts about the SCHIP bill, one way or the other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also disagree with the Senator's implication, if I might say, that congressionally directed projects in the bill are unworthy of Federal spending. I am proud of the projects I included in this bill. I will be glad to defend every one of them. Again, with the transparency we have that came with the new ethics reform bill, all of these have been spread upon the record. We know who asked for them and we know how much money is involved. I am happy to defend every one of the ones I put in there.  I should add that many of the projects the Senator wants to eliminate are, in fact, directed to children's health. Let me cite a few examples.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is congressionally directed funding for St. Francis Hospital in Delaware to expand prenatal maternity and pediatric services to indigents. There is funding for the Youth Crisis Center in Jacksonville, FL to address the serious health consequences facing runaway and homeless youth. There is funding for St. Luke's Regional Medical Center in Boise, ID to expand pediatric services. There is funding for the St. Louis Children's Hospital in St. Louis for neonatal intensive care unit expansion.  There is funding for the Mississippi Gulf Coast Children's Health Project which uses mobile units to provide primary care to indigent children along the gulf coast. There is funding for Child Sight in New Mexico, a vision screening and eyeglass program especially for Native Americans on</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I don't see this as a serious means of doing anything to help children's health. It is an attack on congressionally directed funding to which the Senator is opposed. As I said, I support congressionally directed funding. I always have. I especially support it now with the new provisions on transparency and accountability as a result of the ethics bill we recently passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the remainder of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa, chairman of the subcommittee, has already advanced the substantive argument about our efforts to deal with health care for children. I have supported it with a very solid vote. We will take care of that issue. The President has vetoed the bill, and I and others have signified our willingness to vote to override. It was not overridden in the House. The President has signified his willingness to negotiate. There are some who do not want to negotiate on the  congressional side. I believe that is a mistake. If they want to attach political blame to the President if the program should lapse, ultimately, we will have a negotiation because the American people would see through the facade and understand that those who refuse to negotiate are the ones responsible if the program lapses and is terminated. We will take care of congressional and Federal action for children's health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the amendment seeks to do is to eliminate earmarks. Earmarks have a specific congressional designation budget-wise and are vitally important projects, such as the dredging of the Delaware in Philadelphia to provide a 45-foot channel which traditionally has been the responsibility of the Federal Government under constitutional provisions on waterways and related matters. It would eliminate flood control, which is vital. It would eliminate many items where there is congressional expertise  and understanding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Take the budget that is on the floor now. It is $152 billion. We have allocated $400 million, which is about one-quarter of 1 percent. So 99 3/4  percent goes to the bureaucrats in the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Labor. I suggest that is an imbalance. People in the House of Representatives know their districts much better than people sitting downtown in big bureaus in Washington. Senators know their States better than the bureaucrats.  I dare say the astute Senator from Oklahoma, the proponent of this amendment, knows what is going on in Oklahoma better than the bureaucrats and would be in a better position to identify projects which are worthwhile. But to limit congressional control to one-quarter of 1 percent is certainly not appropriate, certainly not overbearing. I wouldn't call it de minimis because no dollar amount is de minimis. We understand it is not the Government's money; it is the taxpayers' money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from Iowa has made a very fundamental point. In fact, he made a couple of fundamental points; in fact, he has made several fundamental points. One is the transparency. It is all out in the open. We are prepared to debate any move to strike any of the so-called earmarks. Earmarks has become a dirty word. But when you reach a real need somewhere and have an application for Federal funds that a Member of the House or the Senate understands, and in the broader context of one-quarter of  1 percent, I don't think that goes too far to having Members who know their States and know their districts make those allocations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Who yields time?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, may I inquire as to the remaining time?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator has 6 minutes 50 seconds, and the opposition has 23 seconds.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand somewhat amused that we are so powerless that the bureaucracy is going to decide where everything goes. Earmarks are not the only way to decide how the budget is put out, and the fact that we use the excuse that we don't have any control, it is called oversight. Last year in the last Congress more oversight hearings were held by myself and TOM CARPER, true oversight hearings, than all the rest of the Senate. The fact is, we don't want to do the hard work of oversight because it  is easy to earmark something. But in fact, in dredging, you can hold the Corps of Engineers to a priority list. You can bring them before Congress and say: Why aren't you dredging this? How is this a priority against something else? We don't do the hard work of oversight. That is our problem. Instead, we want to do it the easy way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't deny these are good projects. They are. I am not saying they are not. What I am saying is, what about the long term? What about the fact that a  child born today is inheriting $400,000 in unfunded liabilities and that earmarks happen to be the tool that allows us to spend more than we should, not directly through the earmarks but by voting for bills that should not be voted on? But because we have an earmark in the bill, we vote for the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have an unfunded liability right now on Medicare of $34 billion. We are never going to be trusted to fix that problem when we can't be trusted to have an arm's-length separate allocation and look at what the problems are in front of us in terms of labor, health, and human services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't deny what people want to do in this bill could be prioritized. But the number of requests were 36,000 this year. The fact is, can we get what are priorities for this country if we continue the process of using earmarks?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How about children's health? Yes, we passed a bill. We passed a bill that truly wasn't paid for unless we want 22 million Americans to start smoking. We passed a bill that said: We are going to pay $4,000 to buy $2,300 worth of care. We are great stewards when it comes to the American taxpayers' money on this new SCHIP bill. There is no question we are going to get an SCHIP bill. That SCHIP bill is going to truly reflect the needs of the poor people who are not eligible for Medicaid. We are going  to put the money there we need to accomplish that. But to confuse that bill with a process which has got us $9.5 trillion in debt and hung every one of our kids out to dry, that is what this amendment is about. It is the process I am attacking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not attacking individual Senators. I am saying if we are going to get control of the spending, at some point in the future we have to look at the process and how it works. For us to say it is easier for us to earmark than to hold the bureaucracy accountable means we are not doing our job. We can hold the bureaucracies accountable. All we have to do is have an oversight hearing three times a week and make them come up here and explain how they are spending their money. They will start spending  on priorities Americans want. We don't have our hands tied behind us just because we don't do earmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The real question America is asking is, are we going to change our ways about real priorities, the real future for our country, or are we going to continue the same old process that has brought us all the corruption we have seen come through the House in the past that leads to conflicts of interest?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We talk about transparency. We gutted the transparency rules as far as appropriations are concerned in this bill and in our ethics bill, because no longer do you say who is getting it or what it is for. You only say where it is going. The very things that are in the House bill in terms of transparency are not available to us in the Senate, so we can't claim transparency. We are going to get transparency in September of next year when the transparency bill comes about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Harkin mentioned that we didn't offer an option. Senator Burr and I both did, the Every American Kid Insured Act. We talked about it on this floor during the debate on the SCHIP bill. There are other ways to do this. Give them all a tax credit. Let them buy the insurance. We have 9 million kids out there uninsured, 3 million more within 1 year. There are ways for us to solve that. But this is not a farce amendment. This is an amendment about a very real problem. Will  we have the right priorities when it comes to this country or are we going to send $42 million to international labor organizations with no accountability whatsoever from the United Nations? That is what we are doing. That is what this bill does. We have another $400 million worth of earmarks that are not competitively bid and will never be overseen, and you will never see where the money goes. So the question on the amendment is, will we change the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a serious amendment. We should not be earmarking things until we do our business of taking care of kids' insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>We are changing law that we passed less than a year ago under an authorization process. It is much harder to pass an authorization bill than it is an appropriations bill. We should not be changing formulas under an appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GAO numbers that we said would happen are approximately what has happened. Of the $9 million, San Francisco gets $6.2 million. They already get twice as much per HIV/AIDS case as any of the rest of the towns. We put in a hold harmless provision so nobody would lose more than 5 percent of their money. We have been staying by that. We did not guarantee supplemental money. That was done less than a year ago. This is an earmark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were waiting lines for people who needed HIV treatment and care. There are no waiting lines today. What we did last year worked. We should not change it under appropriations now.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to make clear to my colleagues that my amendment does not remove any money from this bill for its intended purpose. In fact, the amendment addresses the Workforce Investment Act, money that goes to training and job  placement in several places in the country. My amendment only changes the language from a sole-source noncompetitive grant, which we would refer to as a direct earmark, to a competitive grant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have all seen that the competitive grant system is a better way to deliver Federal money to specific causes that we support as a Senate because there are criteria, there are standards, and there is accountability. So we are not excluding the AFL-CIO as a provider of the services that we intend, but it opens it for competitive bids. And it is important to realize that the Department of Labor, after judging the performance of the AFL-CIO, has found the performance lacking and has discontinued  the contracts.</paragraph>

  <chair> Sec. __.  To enable the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to carry out the Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program, $5,000,000, which shall include any other amounts made available under this Act for such Program.

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in February of this year, I sent a letter to the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services regarding a report from the Centers for Disease Control that actually blocked an investigation into the death of six firefighters whose personal safety equipment had failed them between 1998 and the year 2000. In the response to me, the inspector general reported that funding of the current funds that exist in the Firefighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention  Fund within the National Institutes of Occupational Health and Safety is flat. Their resources are such that they have had to  pick and choose where they can conduct those kinds of investigations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every year, about 100 firefighters die in the line of duty in America and about 87,000 are injured. This fund is an investigative fund that helps find ways in which we can protect firefighter lives--whether there is a certain kind of equipment that might have made a difference or a certain procedure that might have made a difference. Obviously, for those fire stations, fire houses with the losses or those that face a future risk, to know we are selectively choosing where we investigate and where  we do not does not do the job. We need to investigate all of those fatalities, and we need to do everything possible to provide our firefighters the procedures and equipment necessary to save lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This funding will add an additional $2.5 million to that investigative fund and allow us to complete our responsibility to those courageous firefighters across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent a letter from the International Association of Fire Fighters and the International Association of Fire Chiefs be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>October 18, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>Dear Senator Kerry: On behalf of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, representing nearly 13,000 chief fire and emergency officers, and the International Association of Fire Fighters, representing more than 280,000 professional fire fighters and emergency medical personnel, we are writing to express our strong support for your amendment to the FY 2008 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act providing $5 million for the Fire Fighter  Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program (FFFIPP) of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).</narrative>
  <narrative>Of the 1.1 million fire fighters who selflessly serve their communities and their country, approximately 100 die on the job each year. Additionally, the National Fire Protection Association estimates that 80,100 fire fighter injuries occurred in the line of duty in 2005 alone. The FFFIPP is instrumental in discovering the primary factors contributing to fire fighter deaths and recommending ways to prevent future deaths and injuries.</narrative>
  <narrative>Since its inception in 1998, the FFFIPP--in cooperation with fire departments and fire fighters around the country--has conducted over 300 fatality investigations. The findings and recommendations of these investigations have led to increased awareness of fire fighter safety and health hazards, and led to numerous cooperative efforts among and between the fire service and NIOSH to improve fire fighter safety and health.</narrative>
  <narrative>Despite such successes, fatality investigations are not as common nor as comprehensive as they should be. According to a recent report by the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, such shortcomings are caused, in part, by a lack of resources.</narrative>
  <narrative>Congress clearly intended for NIOSH to thoroughly investigate every fire fighter line-of-duty death. By doubling the funding allocated for the FFFIPP in FY 2007, your amendment will allow NIOSH to better fulfill its Congressional mandate and help prevent fire fighter injuries and deaths.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you for your leadership in protecting the health and safety of our Nation's first responders. We look forward to continue working with you to prevent future deaths and injuries among fire fighters.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
