  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I commemorate National Small Business Week, which President Bush designated for April 22-28, 2007. As ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have made it one of my top priorities to champion our Nation's small businesses and manufacturers and promote their needs and concerns. Our top job creators deserve nothing less. The fact is, small businesses are the driving force behind our Nation's economic growth, creating nearly  three-quarters of all net new jobs and employing nearly 51 percent of the private sector workforce. It is essential that we in Congress continue to support small businesses ability to grow and expand so our economy can accelerate forward and create more jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can tell you, there is no higher priority for me than bolstering the state of our Nation's small manufacturers. In Maine, more than 20,700 manufacturing jobs disappeared between August 2000 and August 2006. We here in  Congress cannot accept any more losses as a foregone conclusion. This vital sector continues to face tremendous challenges--taking on a significant level of domestic costs that foreign competitors do not, including labor costs, fuel costs,  and the regulatory and tax burden. Sadly, as a result, many manufacturers are forced to close their doors or outsource abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reality is, the manufacturing sector, more than any other sector, drives our Nation's economy--with manufacturers responsible for more than 70 percent of private sector research and manufacturing goods making up over 60 percent of U.S. exports. There is no coincidence that this is a value added industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that we can and must fight for our Nation's manufacturers especially when you consider the manufacturing industries pay wages that are about one-third higher than average wages. And that is all the more true for small business when they have resources available that have proven their value, including the SBA which has helped to create or retain over 5.3 million jobs since 1999. And just last year, the manufacturing extension partnership's, MEP's, services helped to create and retain  over 35,000 jobs and increase revenue by $6.25 billion. We must work hand-in-glove with Small Business Administration, SBA, and MEP to bolster our manufacturing base to ensure not only that resources are available to those who wanted to either maintain, grow, or start small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I introduced an amendment today to the America COMPETES Act that clarifies the MEP non-Federal cost share language to enable the MEP centers to draw down all of their available funding and further enhance their capability and capacity to work with manufacturers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment clarifies the intent of Congress when it first enacted the statute authorizing the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program, now known as the Hollings Manufacturing Partnership Program, to provide Federal assistance to manufacturers in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A key concept in the program is the requirement that each center obtain 50 percent of its capital and annual operating and maintenance costs from sources other than the Federal Government. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, officials have, in the past, properly considered cost share requirements to have been met when centers partnered or entered into other agreements with other organizations meeting the needs of American manufacturers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment clarifies and reemphasizes that such agreements and partnerships, and the money spent by those organizations assisting American manufacturers, clearly are to be considered proper cost share as long as the partnering organization is meeting the programmatic objectives for assistance to be provided to American manufacturers as set forth for the Hollings Manufacturing Partnership Program. By teaming with such organizations, as encouraged by the original statute, the centers can and  do leverage their Federal resources and avoid duplicating services necessary for the successful operation of American manufacturers. With the right resources, many more small manufacturers will be eligible to use this program to help grow their business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot ignore the effect that countries like China are having on our Nation's manufacturers. In order to compete fairly in this increasingly competitive global market we must ensure that currencies are not strategically manipulated. That is why I will continue to work with the President and those in Congress to ensure that our Nation gets tough with China on those important issues. I continue to pressure the Treasury Department and the U.S. Trade Representative to also work toward that goal  China to move toward a market-based exchange rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is, our country's future will be determined by today's small businesses. The faster we strengthen and sustain our Nation's small manufacturers, the more quickly America's economy will grow.</paragraph>
