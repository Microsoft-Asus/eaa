  <narrative>PROTECT LAKE MICHIGAN FROM BP DUMPING -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8299]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. KIRK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400222" topic="">
    <paragraph>Today, bipartisan Representatives from Illinois will meet with Bob Malone, the chairman of BP North America. Why? Because Mr. Malone and his team want to increase their dumping of ammonia and suspended solids in our drinking water, Lake Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>BP hired a consultant who told them what they wanted to hear, that despite being one of the most profitable companies on Earth and spending $3 billion to upgrade their Indiana refinery, they can't find the space to prevent dumping in Lake Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This morning, the House will take up a bipartisan resolution condemning BP's plan to dump in Lake Michigan. I hope that BP will tell us today that they are reconsidering their plans. I hope they hear the voices of 2,700 Americans in my district that signed a petition against the BP dumping plan. I hope they hear the voice of 19 Republicans and Democrats that asked the EPA to pull the permit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>BP should hear the voice of the House this morning. If not, BP has to understand that our action this morning is only the opening step by action in the Congress to protect Lake Michigan.</paragraph>
