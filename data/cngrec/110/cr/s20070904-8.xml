    <paragraph>Mr. President, I begin my remarks on this fall calendar in a position of wanting to get a lot of business done. But first I wish to make a few remarks about two of our most distinguished colleagues, Senator Warner of Virginia and Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few days ago, Senator Warner announced he will not seek reelection when his term ends, which is in 2008. John Warner's career in public service began when he was 17 years of age when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II. He did not have to enlist. His father was a distinguished physician in Virginia. He did it because it was the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After an honorable discharge, he, again feeling the call of duty, interrupted his law school studies to join the Marine Corps during the Korean war. Keep in mind, both times, when he joined the Navy and then the Marines, we were at war. During the Korean war, he rose to the rank of captain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Warner is a patriot. If you look up "patriot" and "patriotism" in the dictionary, it says one who loves his country and supports its interests. That is John Warner by definition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When John Warner returned home after the Korean war, he was appointed Under Secretary of the Navy and later became Secretary of the Navy before beginning his five terms in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His work on the Armed Services Committee is certainly legend. His ability to work with Senator Levin has been something I have watched and admired and many times complimented both of them for--their ability to work together, many times on issues that were very difficult to work together on. They always worked together, always looked out for each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the work he did on the Armed Services Committee, I watched firsthand his brilliant work on the Intelligence Committee but very firsthand his work on the Environment and Public Works Committee. From the time I came to the Senate, I worked with John Warner on that committee. I was chairman of that committee on two separate occasions. During the period of time I worked with Senator Warner, I was in the majority, and other times he was in the majority. To John  Warner, it didn't matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can remember the first big Transportation bill we did. We did one every 5 years. What a great example he set for everybody as one of the senior members of that committee. He worked with conservatives, he worked with liberals, he worked with Democrats, and he worked with Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To show his ability to do the right thing, one needs look no further than his own State of Virginia. There was a hotly contested race for the Senate for the State of Virginia. John Warner supported the Democratic candidate rather than the Republican candidate. That is the kind of person he is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have such great admiration for John Warner. He is, in my opinion, what a public servant should be. He is a gentleman and has served the people of Virginia and our Nation with distinction for 30 years or more. Senator Warner's impact on this institution will not be forgotten. I will sorely miss his warmth and friendship. My wife Landra and his wife Jeanne are friends. They have been working together. Every year the Senate spouses have a First Lady's luncheon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two years ago, my wife was chairperson of that. Last year, she was. They are good friends and we will miss them a lot. They are a wonderful couple. I have to say John Warner is top of the line. I have so much admiration for him.</paragraph>
