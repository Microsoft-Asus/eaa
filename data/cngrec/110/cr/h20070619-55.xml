  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am very humbled to be able to join my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus to celebrate and commemorate Juneteenth and to celebrate it on the very day that we have commemorated it over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>June 19 is a special time for Texans. And I would like to, in this very brief time that I have, weave in and out of the history of the meaning of Juneteenth as we reflect upon where we are in 2007 in the education of our young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The failures of this administration are stark, shocking, and extensive. And it is hopefully on this day that maybe a morsel of what many of us have been saying will be caught by someone in the administration to be able to reassess and to be able to think about the remaining time of their tenure in the White House and create a new and different legacy of the educational process of minorities in the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, let me thank DANNY DAVIS for the celebration that we were able to participate in and his leadership on the issue of Juneteenth. I would also like to thank Curtis Faulkner of Fort Worth, who is involved in Juneteenth Heritage and Jazz Festival. I would also like to be able to thank Dr. Ronald Myers, who has been working for years with the National Juneteenth Observance. I would also like to be able to remind my fellow Texans and Houstonians of Reverend C. Anderson Davis, who  brought to us the Emancipation Day celebration in Texas. We lost Reverend Davis just a few weeks  ago, and it is my special privilege to acknowledge him for he came as the regional leader of the NAACP more than four decades ago to Houston, Texas, and he never forgot the routing and the importance of educating our young people about the emancipation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I stand today to be able to chronicle the history and to thank those who are now fighting the battle to preserve Freedman's Town in Houston, Texas, a town that was formulated by freed slaves right after the Emancipation Proclamation that is now under siege by those who would desire to disrupt the few remaining historic buildings and blocks and, if you will, bricks that make up the street, cobblestone bricks. I pray that the energy of those remaining, Reverend Samuel Smith, Captain Roberts,  Reverend Robertson, will hold on, and the number of churches that are in that area, that we will fight for the establishment of a Freedman's Town corridor in the name and in tribute of Juneteenth and the emancipation of our people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me cite for those a depictive picture that shows both celebration and shock as Major Gordon Granger came into Galveston to be able to announce that these yet humble servants, these slaves, were yet free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me quickly go to the language that was offered to me in remarks made by Curtis Faulkner. I want to read, first of all, just a few brief words from the message of Abraham Lincoln during the emancipation: "Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to  the latest generation. We say we are for the union. The world will not forget that we say this."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So he spoke of saving the union, but he also laid the ground work for the Emancipation Proclamation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He continued: "Other means may succeed; this could not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just--a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud and God must forever bless."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was the genesis of the emancipation of slaves, but yet we are still wracked by discrimination and disparity. So when I speak of education and No Child Left Behind, I use Houston as an additional laboratory, testing the fear of children and not the learning of children. We want to reform so that all of our children can learn. Poor funding for underperforming schools, a failure of this administration that never decided to fund. Closing schools, lack of pay for teachers, all of that is meaningful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I close, Mr. Speaker, by saying this. Freedom is not enough and you do not wipe away the scars of centuries by saying now you are free. We want the emancipation to be known in our hearts. We want a national holiday for the Juneteenth. And I look forward to working with my colleagues to commemorate, celebrate, and be reminded of the sweat and blood and tears of those who stand here today.</paragraph>
