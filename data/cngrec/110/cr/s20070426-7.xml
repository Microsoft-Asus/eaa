    <paragraph>Mr. President, our opening prayer this morning was delivered by Rev. John Koski, an associate pastor at the Dearborn Assembly of God in Dearborn, MI. I am delighted that Chaplain Black was able to include him in our schedule of guest Chaplains.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Koski has served as a pastor on a Native American reservation in Montana, as a Christian school administrator in Colorado, and as a Bible College professor in Louisiana. He has conducted a bicycling ministry for 4 years in southeast Asia, traveling 20,000 miles on his bicycle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know my colleague Senator Stabenow joins me in thanking Reverend Koski for delivering our opening prayer this morning and wishing him all the best in his ministries in the future.</paragraph>
