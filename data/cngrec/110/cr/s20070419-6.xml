    <paragraph>Mr. President, the distinguished visiting Chaplain mentioned the Revolutionary War event, and that is memorable. Also, on this day I think it is important, to reflect on the Holocaust, that this day in 1943 was the beginning of the Warsaw Uprising at the Warsaw ghetto. As I recall, the Germans invaded Poland in 1939. They were, to say the least, brutal, especially against the Jews. In about 1941, as I recall, they cordoned off an area that was about 20 blocks by 6 blocks and ordered  everyone out who was not Jewish and ordered all Jews from the whole large metropolitan area of Warsaw into that ghetto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Word got out that the Jews had gathered some weapons, as they had done, minimal in number, and the German tanks came in on this day in 1943. Of course they were to wipe out the ghetto in 1 day, but these gallant Polish patriots, these Jews, held out for more than a month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the annals of history, it is one of the greatest acts of defiance against terrorism that exists. They did it with heroism and gallantry, and it is a day that we should recognize as being a day in the history of mankind where people stood up for what was right and against what was wrong.</paragraph>
