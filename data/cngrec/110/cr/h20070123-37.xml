    <paragraph>Madam Speaker and Members of the House, tonight we will hear the President give his State of the Union address, and I expect and I am confident that he will address energy issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had a meeting this morning with an Assistant Secretary from the Department of Energy, and I believe that we are going to have a chance to have bipartisan effort, Democrats and Republicans, coming together with the President to deal with energy efficiency, renewable energy, and redeveloping and re-energizing our distribution grid throughout the country. This is going to be good for all of America, no matter what side of the aisle you might be on, because it is good for national security. It  is good for the climate, and it is good for jobs across this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Seventh Congressional District of Colorado, which I represent, the suburbs of Denver, we have the preeminent laboratory in America and in the world in the National Renewable  Energy Lab. And with this focus on energy conservation, renewable energy and distributing energy in a way that is reliable, we will make this country more secure. And I am confident that the President is going to focus on it, as will we in the Congress.</paragraph>
