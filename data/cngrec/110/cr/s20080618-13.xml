    <paragraph>Finally, I notified my friend on the other side I also wanted to ask consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 771, <bill type="s" number="3098">S. 3098</bill>, a bill to extend expiring tax relief. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>That was the extender package, the McConnell-Kyl-Grassley package. That includes the 1-year AMT patch omitted by the House bill that we had a vote on yesterday and extends the provisions that expired in 2007 for 2 years. This is a 1-year  longer extension than in the House bill we had the vote on yesterday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="3098">S. 3098</bill> does not include any tax hikes, reflecting the position 41 Senators took in a letter to Senator Baucus on April 23 of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Republican alternative also includes the Ensign-Cantwell energy tax incentives, which were approved by the Senate earlier this year, 88 to 8.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, <bill type="s" number="3098">S. 3098</bill> does not contain the New York City earmark. It also does not contain the tax break for trial lawyers. It also does not contain Davis-Bacon expansion. And it also would not be vetoed by the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On balance, this is a bill that could pass the Senate and get signed by the President. We hope to pass it as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me conclude my remarks by saying that my good friend on the other side of the aisle and I both know how we pass these bills--we pass them together. As he frequently said when he was in the minority and in a position similar to mine, we are not the House. We are the Senate. It is not going to work to turn the Senate into the House. We all know that. Both sides have tried it. We have been in the majority and the minority, and the minority always insists they be part of the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have two important bills here that clearly need to be completed. We all know how to get there--bipartisan negotiation on the Medicare bill and bipartisan negotiation on the tax extender bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I wish to say a word in response to my earlier objections and note the bill related to Medicare, presented by the Senator from Kentucky, the Republican minority leader, failed to include critical provisions that we had in our earlier legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation would have provided financial assistance to low-income Medicare beneficiaries who cannot afford Medicare premiums and it would have finally moved us forward on the issue of mental health parity. This is an issue that is long overdue. There are millions of American families who are struggling with mental health issues. They understand that the high copayments for mental health services in effect deny service to a lot of those who cannot afford them. We wanted to address that in  the bill. We thought it was a priority. The Senator from Kentucky in his measure they brought before us did not include that, and that is unfortunate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to the Senator from Kentucky, I believe in the battle of ideas on the floor of the Senate. Looking back, in the time I have been here I have lost a lot of amendments on the floor. I have come here, brought the amendments, debated them, subjected them to a vote, and lost. But it was a fair fight. People spoke on both sides of the issue. The Senate spoke. That is how it should be. If the majority prevails, then we move forward. That is the only way this body can work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the Republicans have now taken a new approach and that approach is: We will not debate issues. We will not deliberate them. It is a take-it-or-leave-it situation. Seventy-seven filibusters have been used now. They are stopping this Medicare bill. Then when they realize how bad it looks back home--when they know they cannot explain it to seniors and disabled when the doctors who treat them say we are about to take a 10-percent pay cut and I may not be able to see you--they understand it is  hard to explain that vote. So then they come to the floor and make a unanimous consent request to say let's drop in a bill and take care of the whole problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not the way the Senate works either. We don't want to turn the Senate into the House, but the Republican strategy is turning the Senate into a ghost town. We don't do anything here. We have procedural votes three or four times a week and then go home. If those in the Senate were paid on the basis of debate, deliberation, amendments, bills passed and that kind of effort, we would not earn a minimum wage around here because we never get to the substance anymore. There were 77 Republican  filibusters so far, the latest on the energy issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the Senator from Kentucky to come forward and say the reason we could not support the idea of moving forward on these energy tax credit extenders was because they involved a tax--do you know who was going to pay that tax? Companies that locate overseas, American companies that go overseas trying to avoid our taxes would have been subject to more taxes. The Senator from Kentucky is saying 41 of his members have taken a solemn pledge not to raise the taxes of those American companies that go  overseas to avoid paying American taxes. How about that? Is that what we need in America, more incentives to take jobs offshore?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Baucus in the Finance Committee had a reasonable approach to this, taking that money and putting it back into America for tax breaks for our families and to encourage energy production for our future, and the Republicans voted no--time and again they vote no. But the American people will have a final vote on November 4. They will remember the party that is trying to move forward an agenda to make this a better nation and they will remember the party of filibusters that votes  no.</paragraph>
