    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, over the last 7 months, the new Democratic Congress has amassed an impressive record of accomplishment, making real progress on issues important to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, thanks to our efforts, the minimum wage was increased for the first time in a decade. We also sent to the President's desk one of the most important bills of the new Congress, legislation that will make America safer by finally enacting the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, the House also passed a farm bill that reforms our Nation's farm policy by committing more resources to nutrition and conservation programs, while also addressing the needs of our Nation's family farmers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And our efforts continue this week. Today, we will live up to our promise to change the way business is done here in Washington when we pass the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. Tomorrow, we will strengthen the health care safety net programs essential to our children and seniors. And then on Thursday we will pass a comprehensive energy bill that reduces our dependence on foreign oil and fights global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats are delivering results and doing it in a new way.</paragraph>
