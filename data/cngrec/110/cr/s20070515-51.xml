    <paragraph>Mr. President, for those who are watching, I have spoken to people doing the negotiating on immigration, and they tell me they are 80 percent of the way. Well, that is fine, but the other 20 percent is hard. I don't think we lose a step by the agreement that we have just had. It will allow the people who have been working on this matter for a number of weeks to have a few more days to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be different if we had nothing else to do here, but this will kind of clear the deck so we can, hopefully, complete WRDA, the budget, send something to conference on the supplemental, and then next week we have to do the conference report on the supplemental, which shouldn't take long, and then spend that time, if we can get an agreement, on immigration. That is why we have done what we have done with this consent agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Sessions have up to 3 hours under his control to speak on Monday, May 21; that the hour prior to cloture be reserved for the two leaders or their designees; and that Senator Sessions also have 2 hours under his control on Tuesday, May 22, when and if we go to the immigration matter.</paragraph>
