  <speaking speaker="412211" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 220 years ago when the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution of the United States, they chose to create the United States Congress in its first article. That was their way of ensuring that we did try to form a more perfect Union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last few decades, Presidents and Congresses of both parties, through action and inaction, have allowed our system of checks and balances to go quite askew. Many of us believe that it has reached a tipping point. That is why we will over the next few weeks and months talk about article I, the article of the Constitution which vests all legislative power in a Congress of the United States elected by the people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Founding Fathers did not want to see peoples' lives be decided by one decider. They vested their power in the people through their representatives. Over the next few months, we hope to help reassert the authority that the Founding Fathers envisioned for this body.</paragraph>
