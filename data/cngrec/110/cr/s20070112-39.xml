    <paragraph>Mr. President, we now have 32 amendments pending to the ethics bill. I understand the Parliamentarians have been reviewing amendments to determine whether they are germane to the legislation. A lot of work remains to be done with respect to this bill, and we will finish next week. So Members should be ready to be here for long days and sessions into the evening. The first vote of next week will be at 5:30 p.m., Tuesday, and other votes will follow that evening.</paragraph>
