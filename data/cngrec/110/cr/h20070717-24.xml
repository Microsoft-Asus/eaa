  <narrative>INTERIM REPORT SHOWS THAT A NEW DIRECTION IS NEEDED IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H7858]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412212" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week the White House released an interim report on Iraq that unfortunately reaffirms what we have known for quite some time: The President's troop escalation plan is not working and we are desperately in need of a new direction in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the President announced his surge 6 months ago, we have lost 600 American troops and spent another $60 billion. And yet by the Bush administration's own admission, there is unsatisfactory progress on all of the political reconciliation benchmarks announced by the President in January.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, just days after this report was released, the White House once again asked for more time to pursue the President's failed strategy. But the American people and this Democratic Congress know that more time and lower standards are no substitute for real progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for a new direction in Iraq. The House acted last week. The Senate has the opportunity this week. They should join us in changing course.</paragraph>
