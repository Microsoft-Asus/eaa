  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think it is important that all of us want what is best for the men and women on the front lines in Iraq. Certainly it is disturbing when we find that there is a confusion in the reporting of the incident that saw the loss of life of approximately four or five of our soldiers. First, it was represented that they died in a battle fighting against the insurgents and others; later to be determined that they had been kidnapped and shot in the head execution-style.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This, of course, speaks to the failed policy of this administration that our soldiers can declare victory and be returned home, but more importantly it certainly is a shame when we cannot tell parents and loved ones and others how their loved ones fell in battle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly it is a shame that we find that our young men and women on the front lines may be subject to capture and execution, like being shot in the streets in a most disgraceful manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must fix the broken policies of Iraq. Redeploy our troops, engage our allies in the region, begin a political diplomatic solution, and stop falsifying reports to the American people, not knowing how their loved ones are being executed in the streets of Iraq. I ask for a new policy in Iraq.</paragraph>
