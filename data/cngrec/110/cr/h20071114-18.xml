    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this weekend, communities throughout our Nation honored the brave men and women who have defended our Nation in previous wars, as well as those who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. While parades, speeches and ceremonies are important, I believe it is more important for the U.S. Government to properly care for and honor our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, the Department of Defense has instituted a new policy on bonuses, which does not provide servicemembers with their full enlistment bonus, reenlistment or other bonuses if they are wounded while in combat and cannot return to duty. This means that combat wounded veterans who are discharged from the military because of their serious injuries will not receive their full bonus. This policy is unacceptable and disgraceful. It is unbelievable that the men and women who have sacrificed so  much for our Nation are being shortchanged and denied the bonuses they were promised by their government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Jason Altmire has legislation to correct this inequity, but we should not have to rely on legislation. I call upon the Commander in Chief, President Bush, to reverse this policy immediately. We have a letter going to the President asking him to terminate this policy and ensure all outstanding bonuses be paid promptly.</paragraph>
