    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague from Missouri in saluting the 40th anniversary of Public Broadcasting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the floor of the House we're surrounded by controversy on so many issues, but the unique achievement that is our system of public broadcasting really does bring us together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In those 40 years we've evolved a powerful system with NPR and PBS, through the hundreds of stations around the country, 100 million viewers of public television a week. Many cities around the country especially my own Hometown, Portland, the number one radio station is its public radio station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have evolved a national voice that deals with issues of education, of music and public affairs. We've been able to prove empirically that the people who get their news from NPR actually have an identifiable, measurable, more accurate view of what's happening in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since public broadcasting was established in 1967, the Federal Government has spent trillions of dollars, but there is no investment during those last 40 years that has paid greater dividends for the American people.</paragraph>
