    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon to pay tribute to one of our Nation's heroes, Staff Sergeant Delmar White. Sergeant White lost his life when serving a convoy mission in Baghdad, Iraq on September 2, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant White was a dedicated soldier and served in the Marine Corps in the Persian Gulf War. He had been a member of the Kentucky Army National Guard since 1998 and was serving in Iraq with Battery B, 2nd Battalion, 138th Field Artillery based in Carlisle, Kentucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recently had the opportunity to visit with Sergeant White's family, and his wife conveyed to me that he died for a cause that he truly believed in. His fellow officers, noncommissioned officers and soldiers told me of a kind and gentle man who was dedicated to the military and to his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, as we honor his memory, our thoughts and prayers turn to his wife, Michelle, their two children, Shelby and Seth, and his family and friends as they struggle with the loss of this great man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation is deeply indebted to Sergeant Delmar White for his service, dedication to his mission, and for making the ultimate sacrifice.</paragraph>
