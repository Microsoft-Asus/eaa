  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="LANCE CORPORAL THOMAS P. ECHOLS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today because a brave man from Kentucky has fallen in the far-away country of Iraq. LCpl Thomas P. Echols was tragically killed on December 4, 2006, during combat operations in the city of Ramadi. The Shepherdsville, KY, native was 20 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lance Corporal Echols was serving his second deployment in Iraq. For his valor as a U.S. Marine, he received several medals, awards, and decorations, including the National Defense Service Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, and the Purple Heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Raised in Shepherdsville, in Bullitt County, Tom was actually born in Mount Clemens, MI, and as a result Tom brought with him to Kentucky a fast and true love for his University of Michigan Wolverines. His grandfather, Don Wight, still recalls how his grandson once saved up money for weeks to buy tickets to a University of Michigan football game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I'm an MSU grad, he's a dyed-in-the-wool University of Michigan fan. Anything he could find that was U of M memorabilia, he had it," says Don. "He was just a good, fun-loving young man." Despite the longstanding rivalry between the University of Michigan and Michigan State, Tom and his grandfather went to that Wolverines football game together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Tom's eyes looked north to his beloved Wolverines, his feet were firmly planted in Kentucky. He attended Cedar Grove Elementary School, Bernheim Middle School, and Bullitt Central High School, all in Shepherdsville. He graduated from Riverview High School in Shepherdsville in 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Growing up, Tom belonged to his school's football and track teams. He played video games and paintball. And in high school he participated in Junior ROTC and the drill team, perhaps preparing himself for the military life he hoped would lie ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom chose to pursue service in uniform by the time high school graduation rolled around. His father, Kurt Echols, remembers his son thinking of a career in the Armed Forces as early as middle school. Perhaps Tom drew inspiration from his father, a veteran himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom "was a good kid, loved sports, a big Michigan fan," Kurt says of his son, and remembers him as someone who always enjoyed a good joke.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the fall of 2004, Tom enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. He was a member of the 1st Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division from Camp Lejeune, NC, and during his deployment to Iraq, his regiment fell under the command of the First Marine Expeditionary Force, Forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom's longtime friend Tim Zamboroski was sorry to see the childhood buddy he had grown up with whisked away to the other side of the world. As kids, Tom and Tim used to play baseball together in the backyard. As men, they would trade e-mails back and forth from America to Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I think he was pretty happy with serving the country," Tim says. "I'm going to miss him." When he heard Tom had been killed, Tim says he felt as if he had lost a brother.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lance Corporal Echols drove humvees during his first tour in Iraq, and by his second tour had become an infantryman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While serving in the Marine Corps, he also became a husband, after asking Allyson Echols, whom he met in high school, to marry him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom and Allyson married during the week of Thanksgiving in 2005. Allyson now raises the couple's young daughter, Julia, who sadly never got to meet her father.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom was buried at the Zachary Taylor National Cemetery in Louisville, KY, with full military honors. A large crowd of people came to pay their final respects. Sheriffs from both Bullitt County and neighboring Jefferson County were there, and Tom's father Kurt remembers with pride that members of a local fire department erected a large American flag in honor of his son.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our prayers are with the family of Lance Corporal Echols today as God comforts them for their tragic loss. We are thinking of his wife Allyson; his daughter Julia; his parents Kurt and Rose; his sister Rebecca; his brother Alexander; his grandparents Jerry and Sharon Echols and Donald and Mary Wight; and many other beloved family members and friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This U.S. Senate expresses its deepest gratitude for LCpl Thomas P. Echols's life of service. And we express our deepest gratitude for the Echols family, for nurturing this man, patriot, and marine who answered the call in his country's time of need.</paragraph>
