    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the two people most responsible for our Nation's failed energy policy are the two oilmen in the White House--President Bush and Vice President Cheney.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From their earliest days in the White House, they surrounded themselves with other executives from Big Oil. As Newsweek reported in 2001, "not since the rise of the railroads more than a century ago has a single industry placed so many foot soldiers at the top of the new administration." And when it came to actually creating an energy policy, Vice President Cheney met in secret with oil executives in Big Oil in the Vice President's home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This administration admits that 95 percent of its energy policy has now been enacted, so let's take a look at exactly what it has produced. Over the past 7 years, gas prices have more than tripled, while for 5 straight years now the major oil companies have amassed close to $600 billion in profits. Meanwhile, our dependence on foreign oil has increased by 753 million barrels a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Democrats have rejected this failed policy and instead are working to pass legislation that will provide consumers relief while ending our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
