  <narrative>REMEMBERING SEAN KENNEDY -- (Senate - May 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4779">S4779</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in remembrance of a young man whose life was cut short because of a tragic crime--a hate crime. I came to the Senate floor, 1 year ago today, to speak about a vicious attack that killed Sean Kennedy on May 16, 2007. He was just 20 years old. As I have done countless times in the past, I have again come to the floor to highlight the needless deaths of hate crimes' victims and the need to enact Federal hate crimes legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, I had the opportunity to speak to Sean Kennedy's mother Elke Kennedy. I had heard that Elke had read about her son in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD and was grateful that someone had recognized his death and understood the need for hate crimes legislation. For every victim of a hate crime, many more family members and friends are impacted by the tragic loss. While I know the pain of losing a son, I can only imagine the grief Elke must have felt when someone took the life of her son  simply for who he was. As a nation, what do we say to Elke and other family members who have lost a loved one to a hate crime? What salve do we have to offer them for their pain? I believe we could start by passing Federal hate crimes legislation to demonstrate our national commitment to ending bias-motivated crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No parent should have to fear for their child's safety because of their sexual orientation and because our laws do not adequately protect them. It is the Government's first duty to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal and State laws intended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes motivated by hate are woefully inadequate. Sean's death is an unfortunate reminder of this fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Matthew Shepard Act would better equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by protecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens already covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can lessen the very impact of hate on our society. Moreover, for parents like Elke Kennedy and Judy Shepard, Matthew's mother, it will finally prove that their sons' deaths were not in vain.</paragraph>
