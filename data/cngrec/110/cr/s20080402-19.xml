  <narrative>HONORING ALBERT W. BELL -- (Senate - April 02, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="2340">S2340</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor Albert Bell, who is retiring from the Durango Police Department following a lifelong career in law enforcement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since moving to Colorado from Kansas nearly 27 years ago, Al has dedicated himself and his talents to protecting the communities of southwest Colorado--first as a sergeant and then as Undersheriff for the La Plata County Sherriff's Department, and, for the past 14 years, as chief of police for the Durango Police Department. He also served with me on the Police Officers Standards and Training Board and the Anti-Bullying in Schools Task Force during my tenure as attorney general of Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored and privileged to have worked with Al personally over the years, both as attorney general and now as a U.S. Senator. Throughout his career and our work together, Al has demonstrated strong leadership, integrity, and an unyielding commitment to public safety. These attributes have made him one of the most well-regarded law enforcement officials in our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al's contributions to southwest Colorado extend beyond law enforcement. He currently serves as president of the Southwest Colorado Mental Health Board of Directors, and is a member of both the La Plata Health Care Project Steering Committee and the Regional Juvenile Center Task Force. Al's involvement in these and other community organizations speaks to his generosity, selflessness, and his love for the southwest Colorado community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, southwest Colorado has benefitted tremendously because Al Bell chose a path of public service. He has set an example for all Americans to live by. While I am sorry to see him go, I know that he has very much earned a healthy and happy retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the people of Colorado, I thank Al for his service, and wish him all the best in his future endeavors.</paragraph>
