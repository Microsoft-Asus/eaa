  <speaking speaker="300030" topic="RETIREMENT OF JAMES A. (JIM) SHERIDAN">
    <paragraph>Madam President, an Idahoan with the distinction, among other things, of being the oldest fire lookout in the Nation at age 89 retired from that important post and from the Federal Government in September. James A. "Jim" Sheridan concluded a long and dedicated career that began, at age 53, what could be called a second career in 1971, when he joined the Bureau of Land Management as a seasonal surveyor. In 1976, Jim became a fire prevention patrolman, and, at age 67, became the  Mount Harrison seasonal lookout in the Sawtooth National Forest Minidoka Ranger District. Over the past 22 years, Jim has provided a fire prevention message to no fewer than 35,000 national forest visitors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a lifelong rancher and 36-year veteran of Government service in the second half of his life, Jim has captured the secret to staying young--that of knowing you are never too old to start something new. Jim's life is a wonderful example of the fact that success comes as the result of hard work. Idahoans who visited the Sawtooths were both safer and better educated about our rugged and beautiful natural resources as a result of Jim's dedication and efforts. I wish Jim and his family well on his  retirement, and I thank him for his service to our Nation and to Idaho.</paragraph>
