    <paragraph>Mr. President, recently I returned from Iraq where I visited Tikrit, Baghdad, Bamadi, and Balad with three of my congressional colleagues. We had the opportunity to meet with the commanding officers and troops on each location. On the floor of the Senate I spoke to you about witnessing firsthand some of the progress being made. Since I have seen so little coverage of that progress, I think progress bears repeating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new plan, the counterinsurgency plan, is showing initial signs of progress. Violence in al-Qaim, Haditha, Hit, Ramadi, and Falluja has dramatically decreased due to local leaders now siding with coalition forces pursuing al-Qaida in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Baghdad, U.S. and Iraqi security forces are clearing and holding some of the most dangerous areas, and sectarian violence has decreased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was especially impressed with the successes in Ramadi, where only a few months ago some were claiming it lost forever, and al-Qaida said it was going to establish its headquarters there. In April, attacks in Ramadi decreased by 74 percent. All 23 tribal areas in Ramadi are cooperating with U.S. forces to fight al-Qaida militants, 263 weapons caches were discovered in the preceding 3 months, and Iraqis are volunteering by the thousands to join the Army and local police force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am disappointed this progress has not been widely covered by the media in the United States. In fact, the only TV coverage I have seen was a 60-second clip by Nick Johnson of CNN, who did an excellent job. I see the LA Times had a story, "Iraqi Tribal Chiefs Forming an Anti-Insurgent Party."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The frustration at the failure of our media to call the successes what they were is very high. Earlier last week, my office received an e-mail from one of our troops serving in Iraq. He detailed an exciting success story, the establishment of a new joint command precinct for Iraqi police, Iraqi Army and Marines, the first such precinct headquarters to be established in Falluja. His e-mail detailed what a success the operation had been. Almost 200 Iraqis volunteered for police recruitment, hundreds  more received outpatient medical care, damage claims were settled, and all present received food and oil rations. And the Iraqis seemed to be very pleased to be cooperating with the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the enemy, being very clever, working to thwart any and all progress, reacted to this success story by sending in some poor suicide bomber. Thanks to aggressive patrolling efforts by Iraqi forces, the bomber was forced to detonate his vest almost half a mile away when he was halted by police. He caused superficial wounds to one Iraqi civilian and killed himself. No one else was injured, no other damage caused. In the aftermath of the incident the precinct signed up an additional 75 recruits  for police service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As this American warrior wrote to us:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bomber failed. He failed to kill innocents and he failed to deter the progress of standing up Iraqi police.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But to his frustration there was no coverage of this good news story. Indeed, the media, the U.S. media totally misreported the story. A number of media outlets carried these headlines. From the Baltimore Sun, "Attack on Iraq Police, At Least 20 Dead."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the Los Angeles Times, "Twenty Iraqis Die in Suicide Attacks."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our correspondent wrote that he was shocked. He checked it out every way he could, but it appears to have been a false report. The headlines refer to the failed attack but depicted a dramatically different outcome. There has been no apparent retraction, so thousands upon thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands who saw the headline assumed yet another tragic incident occurred in Falluja and just lumped that in with all the other bad news that makes up a grim picture of Iraq. And you see why our  men and women fighting over there are frustrated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The following morning our correspondent found himself in another situation. He learned a combined Iraqi Army police and U.S. Marine patrol in Falluja encountered a small band of insurgents at a suicide vehicle factory. The police engaged the enemy, killing four of them, and the Iraqi Army and Marines trapped additional escaping insurgents, killing three more. Two large trucks laden with explosives and rigged to be suicide vehicles were found.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was a best case scenario: enemy killed in his tracks, weapon was discovered before it caused any harm, there were no civilian casualties whatsoever, and U.S. demolition forces blew up the two suicide vehicles. Instead of celebrating this success, the e-mail noted--the writer noted it was disappointing to read a headline, "Children Killed."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the story, the U.S. tank fired a high-explosive round at insurgents placing an IED in Fallujah yesterday, killing three Iraqi children. The insurgents got away. To anyone watching the news that day, it would seem the war in Iraq is being lost and the terrorists are winning. While there has been significant progress in Iraq, there is no doubt we are losing the war of information. I couldn't have said it better than the young man who wrote my office in frustration, who said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What incredible economy of effort the enemy is afforded when U.S. media is their megaphone. Why spend precious resources on developing your own propaganda machine when you can make your opponent's own news outlets scream your message louder than you ever hoped to do independently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The young man ended his e-mail by saying the incidents he detailed were very important to him and his comrades who were serving in Iraq. Typical of our brave warfighters, the young man stressed that he and his fellow soldiers will continue to fight the fight. He acknowledged there will be mistakes, setbacks, and casualties that the world will hear about, but there will also be successes, victories over enemy combatants, progress, stability, and growth in the new Iraq, but, tragically, it appears  no one is going to hear about that in our media since it has been increasingly clear that our media is unwilling or able to report anything except bloody headlines and bad news. The U.S. Government has a responsibility to do a better job of public diplomacy, strategic influence getting our story out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. military has made a real difference in Iraqi communities. There are examples of good stories, such as the local new precinct joint command headquarters. But somehow we are not doing an adequate job of spreading the news. Let me cite an example from today's Washington Post page A11: "Tribal Coalition In Anbar Said To Be Crumbling." Well, I have missed it, perhaps, if I saw anything in the Washington Post about the coalition. About 23 sheiks in the tribal areas are cooperating with the  United States. But when you read the story a little farther, you see the headline is about one Sunni leader who has great concern about another Sunni leader, and calls him a "traitor." Unfortunately, this happens to go on frequently among tribes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you read farther down in the story, we finally interview General Petraeus. General Petraeus said: I think they have done this for their lives. This is not just a business deal that they have struck; when you oppose al-Qaida, you are putting it all on the line. This is not an economic issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was the message from our commander. He did not get the headline. There was another member of the council who said that: The salvation is like one family. There are no problems between us and the members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. military officials said virtually everyone in Anbar belongs to a tribe and that rather than ignore that fact, they were trying to exploit it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is an overlay of government structure and tribal structure, and the two, when they work well, mesh and, in a sense, complement each other in Anbar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was able to see an article, a TV story by Ollie North this past Sunday, a war story. He was talking about the good old days in World War II. If there was anything good about the old days in World War II, Hollywood and the media were on the same side as our troops. What a wonderful vestige of the old times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought this was a great opportunity to see what had happened in the past. The war of ideas and public opinion is not just critical in Iraq, it is critical in the broad war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we know from reading the statements of Ayman al-Zawahari, the No. 2 in command, he knows they cannot win the war militarily; they can win it only by influencing public opinion in the United States. Unfortunately, recent congressional action indicates the terrorists may not be far off base. Resolutions to withdraw from Iraq, delaying funding for the troops, telling the Sunni terror cells and the Shia militias that America's political will is wavering--the supporters of these resolutions are  sending a message: Hang on, the United States will not have the political will to outlast them. Our men and women in uniform are right to be disheartened that we have not only the media but some Members of Congress who are unduly influenced by our enemy. It is critical that we not fall into this trap set by al-Qaida and the  other Islamic terrorists who wish to defeat us.</paragraph>
