    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will conduct a period of morning business for the next hour, with Republicans controlling the first half. Following that, we will resume consideration of the immigration legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I walked by the President's Room today and said hello to a bunch of Senators in there. They were in there working on the immigration bill, Democrats and Republicans. We don't see enough of that. It was really, for me, a good scene. They were in there and had stacks of papers. They are trying to figure out a way to get through the immigration bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all acknowledge that the immigration system in our country is broken and needs to be fixed. I am not foolish enough to think we are going to make it perfect with this bill, if we can get it out of the Senate. We need to try. We have an obligation to try. That is what is happening on a bipartisan basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want Senators to keep working and see what we can do. There are certain issues, they have told me, they think will give Democrats heartburn and other issues that will give Republicans heartburn. Therefore, they are trying to get an agreement on some amendments, to have a 60-vote margin. That is the way it should be. We should not be in a posture where somebody is filibustering something they don't like. I hope people will be reasonable and continue to work as they have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spoke to the distinguished Republican leader late last night, and we talked briefly this morning. We are looking forward to, when the House finishes the emergency supplemental, moving to that as soon as we can. It is an important issue. We have struggled on this now for months. Emotions are high. I think it is time to move on and see what we can do to fund the troops in an appropriate way. So we will keep Members informed. I have told the distinguished Republican leader that I will keep him  informed on any word I get from the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have gotten calls, and people are upset that some of their things are not in this piece of legislation. It is very difficult--the President's Chief of Staff, in the first meeting Senator McConnell and I had with Josh Bolten, said: On this issue, I speak for the President. He said: If I don't have authority to speak for the President, I will go back to the President. When he called me, as he has on a number of occasions, and said: I am telling you that if this provision is in the bill,  the President is going to veto it, we worked through some of these. We had to take certain things out of the bill. It wasn't a pleasure to do that because Members are affected on both sides. We had some issues that only affected the Senate. The President was unhappy with that. I wish he would let us do what we wanted to do, but we are in a position where that cannot be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the bill is in a position where we can fund the troops without a lot of animosity at this stage. People can make whatever statement they want regarding the war, and I am sure that will happen. I think we need to get to this as quickly as we can.</paragraph>
