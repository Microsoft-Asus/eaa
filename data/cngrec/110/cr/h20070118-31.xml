    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to an issue that concerns all of us, and that is railroad safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Tuesday night, there was a train derailment near my congressional district in East Rochester, Monroe County, New York. Fortunately, no one was injured. There have been dozens of other derailments in New York: Recently, on December 28 along route 15 in Gang Mills, in which cars were carrying butane.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to an online Federal Railroad Administration database, defective tracks have been the number one cause of train derailments since 1996 in New York and Monroe County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I understand the role of railroads and the importance they serve in transporting goods and people across the country. As a member of the House Transportation Committee which oversees the railroad industry, I firmly believe that Congress must provide more thorough oversight of this industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, I believe that Congress, CSX, and the Federal Railroad Administration and the Department of Environmental Conservation must work together to identify what must be done to avoid similar disasters in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to create a safer, more efficient rail system for everyone.</paragraph>
