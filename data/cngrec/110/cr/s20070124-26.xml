    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I commend an outstanding Arkansas company for a truly amazing gift. Murphy Oil Corporation, an El Dorado, AR, based company, has always been a national leader in philanthropy by providing substantial donations for many very worthwhile causes, especially education. Murphy Oil's recent announcement to establish the El Dorado Promise may be one of the most significant and groundbreaking gifts of any business to any group of people in recent  years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>El Dorado Promise is an extraordinary scholarship program. The Promise will provide the opportunity for every graduate of El Dorado High School to pursue higher education by granting a scholarship to these students to be used at community colleges or public universities around the country. This scholarship will cover tuition and other expenses for many of these students for up to 5 years. The leadership at Murphy Oil has shown that they truly understand that in order to adequately prepare for  the future we must make significant investments in the children of today. This gift represents that significant investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to congratulate the students, families, teachers, and community of El Dorado, AR. This is a wonderful gift that you truly deserve, and I am excited for the tremendous prospects it will create for you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to take this opportunity to commend the actions of Claiborne Deming, president and CEO of Murphy Oil. A great business leader known for his strong support of education, Mr. Deming has served on the Arkansas Board of Education, helped found the Arkansans for Education Reform Foundation, is president of the El Dorado Education Foundation, and continues to be a strong catalyst for investment in education. I have no doubt he was instrumental in providing these students and families the  ability to fulfill their ambitions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would like to personally thank Murphy Oil Corporation, Mr. Claiborne Deming, and members of the Murphy family for their unwavering support of El Dorado, the State of Arkansas, and the education system. There is no doubt the gift of the El Dorado Promise will better many lives and shape the future of Arkansas and the country in a brighter way.</paragraph>
