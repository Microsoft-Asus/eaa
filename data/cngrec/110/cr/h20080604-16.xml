    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, according to the Energy Information Agency, the United States currently imports 60 percent of its oil, and that number is expected to rise to 75 percent in the coming decades. As a country, we need to reduce our dependency on foreign fuel sources and start implementing alternative energy sources that can be found here in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Imported fuels such as crude oil and natural gas are costing this country millions of dollars a year, accounting for about one-third of the U.S. trade deficit. At $45 a barrel, liquid coal fuel is a desirable alternative to the $120 or more barrel of oil. Not only does this innovative fuel cost less, but also coal is one of the most abundant resources in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Congress continues to explore the use of alternative energy sources, we need to look closely at the enormous benefits of coal-to-liquid technology.</paragraph>
