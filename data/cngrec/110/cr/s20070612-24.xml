    <paragraph>Mr. President, this month marks the 75th anniversary season of Jacob's Pillow. Based in Becket, MA, it is the longest running dance festival in the United States. Jacob's Pillow is renowned in the dance world for its commitment to excellence and beloved by audiences throughout the world for the quality and diversity of its programming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This prestigious organization is one of the most significant cultural groups in Western Massachusetts and it attracts tens of thousands of visitors to the beautiful Berkshire Mountains each summer. Cultural tourism is the second largest industry in Massachusetts, and cultural jewels such as Jacob's Pillow are the anchors of the industry. Year after year, surveys demonstrate that arts, culture, and heritage are among the top reasons for visiting Massachusetts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With its proud heritage, Jacob's Pillow continues to be one of the most dynamic centers of dance in our State and across the country. As Mikhail Baryshnikov has said, "Jacob's Pillow is one of America's most precious cultural assets--a haven for choreographers and dancers and an environment that nurtures the creation of new work."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The site was originally a family farm settled with extraordinary pioneering spirit in the 1700s, and it became a station on the Underground Railroad in the 19th century for slaves escaping to freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1933, Jacob's Pillow was established as a dance festival and school. Its mission continues today to support dance creation, presentation, education, and preservation. Through this work, it broadens appreciation and understanding for classical and modern dance--and it provides an important opportunity for dancers and choreographers to develop their own work and skills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to its regular programming, Jacob's Pillow also offers over 200 free events each season, including performances, workshops, lectures, and discussions with artists. It maintains a preservation program with rare archives open to the public, a training program for arts administrators, year-round community programs, and a creative development residency program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jacob's Pillow also encompasses a professional school training and mentoring program for emerging dancers and is recognized throughout the globe as a center for arts leadership in the world of dance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the first and only dance institution in the United States to be declared a National Historic Landmark for its important part in our country's cultural heritage. It embodies the very best in cultural achievement and has enhanced the causes of the many talented artists who have performed on its stages and enhanced the lives of countless audiences who have enjoyed their exceptional performances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As President Kennedy said, "I am certain that after the dust of centuries has passed over our cities, we, too, will be remembered not for victories or defeats in battle or in politics, but for our contribution to the human spirit."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the many dedicated persons who have made Jacob's Pillow such a remarkable success over the past 75 years. May this treasure of Berkshire County continue to enrich us all in the years ahead.</paragraph>
