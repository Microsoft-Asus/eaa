    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Jewish American Heritage Month to recognize the contributions the Jewish people have made to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have come to understand that to the Jewish people, the word "heritage" has deep meaning. It is not simply a sense of pride or history. It is a belief that each person should in some way improve the world. The often quoted Rabbi Hillel asked the question, "If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am not for others, who am I?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is this same set of values that brings Jewish groups to the Hill advocating not just for so-called Jewish issues, but for issues that affect everyone; better education, better healthcare, more protections for the environment, free speech, and separation of church and state. The Jewish community feels a special obligation to repair the world, one little piece at a time, for all people, not just their own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful to the organizations in my own district for their contributions to our community. From providing educational and social services, to involvement in local and national policy,  the commitment to improving our society is one of the many values I have come to respect in the Jewish community in Baltimore and across this Nation.</paragraph>
