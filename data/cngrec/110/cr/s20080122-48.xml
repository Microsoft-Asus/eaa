  <narrative>RIALTO AIDS WALK -- (Senate - January 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="89">S89</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize an important event that has occurred in my State of California. To honor World AIDS Day, the city of Rialto partnered with Brothers and Sisters in Action, BASIA, and First Chance/Youth-Community Health Outreach Workers to host the inaugural AIDS Walk Rialto on December 8, 2007. I am pleased to say that it was a success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since reported in 1981, HIV/AIDS has become the most significant communicable disease in San Bernardino County for African Americans. The rate of HIV among this group has increased dramatically since the first cases were reported. In 2005, 18 percent of the new HIV cases in San Bernardino County were in African Americans, yet African Americans represent only 8.5 percent of the population of the county. AIDS Walk Rialto aimed to broaden awareness of this disparity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the city of Rialto and the organizers of this event for the work that they are doing to turn the tide of HIV/AIDS infections on the local level. Better education and awareness programs can make a tremendous difference in stopping the spread of this disease, and I encourage an even larger parade next year.</paragraph>
