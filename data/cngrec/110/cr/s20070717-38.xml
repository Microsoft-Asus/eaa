  <speaking speaker="300030" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, on April 17, Walter Nevada, the oldest living Shoshone-Bannock tribal elder and remaining original allottee on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation passed away. He was 101 years old. Walter was a distinguished member of one of the oldest tribes in Idaho. He was a religious man of wisdom respected by his people, a great teacher and leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The government of the Shoshone Bannock Tribes has existed for many generations. Traditional tribal government was based upon small bands of closely related families. Today the tribes are organized as a sovereign government, providing many services to tribal members and non-Indians with revenues from agriculture, business enterprises, tourism and many other operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though thousands of years have passed, the Shoshone and Bannock Tribes continue to leave an indelible mark on the ongoing history of North America and Idaho. One example is the recent successful endeavor of the Shoshone Bannocks to certify a tribal member as a Federal inspector of underground fuel storage tanks. This is the first time that this collaboration between a tribe and the Environmental Protection Agency has occurred, and demonstrates the Shoshone Bannock Tribes' commitment to working  with the U.S. Government on the critical issue of ground water protection. Also, working in coordination with State and Federal agencies, the Shoshone Bannocks have an active air quality monitoring program. The tribe continues to successfully preserve its history and way of life, while recognizing and promoting its critical role in stewardship of the environment. I have been pleased to work with them in the past, and look forward to doing so in the future.</paragraph>
