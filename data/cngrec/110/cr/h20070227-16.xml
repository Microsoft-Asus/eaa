    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have a bill, but in our traditional, bipartisan way, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. King).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill>) to provide for the establishment of the Science and Technology Homeland Security International Cooperative Programs Office, and for other purposes.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. King) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on this legislation, and insert extraneous material on the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at the outset, let me thank the gentleman from Mississippi, Chairman Thompson, for his cooperation, not just in the previous Congress on putting this legislation together, but also today in his generosity in allowing me to go forward on it. To me, this is typical and symbolic of the bipartisanship which he has brought to the committee both as ranking member and now as chairman. I thank him for that. And more than his personal kindness and generosity, let me also say that  it is so vitally important that on issues such as this that there be bipartisan cooperation working across the aisle because all of our lives changed on September 11. All of us realized we had to change the way we did business, whether it was creating the Department of Homeland</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it also requires us to establish firmer relationships with our allies, finding areas of common ground among us and our allies, and that is what <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill> will do. <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill> is the Promoting Antiterrorism Cooperation through Technology and Science Act, PACTS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an effort by us to have our Department of Homeland Security and our government work with our allies and friends around the world to find common ways to confront terrorism, to use technology to confront terrorism, and it does that initially by establishing the International Cooperation Programs Office within the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also authorizes $25 million a year in fiscal years 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. So $25 million for each of the next four fiscal years. It specifies by name Great Britain, Singapore, Israel, Canada, and Australia as countries that we should especially work more closely with to exchange technology and research, and to work together on a common effort at the government level, at the university level, private foundations, to put aside any technical differences that may separate us, to try to work  through any legal impediments there may be to the type of cooperation that we believe is absolutely essential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation did pass our committee in the last Congress and passed the House. Unfortunately, it was blocked in the Senate. We certainly hope that under the leadership of Chairman Thompson it will again pass the House this year, and hopefully the Senate will do the right thing this year and we can get this legislation to the President's desk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The war on terrorism will involve many of us for many years. The more allies and partners and friends we can have working with us, the more we can share our expertise and technology that make us stronger and make the enemy weaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the adoption of <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill> and thank the gentleman from Mississippi for his cooperation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill>, Promoting Antiterrorism Cooperation through Technology and Science Act, a bill considered in one form or another since the 108th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is an old saying we tell school children: if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although these words of encouragement may have originally applied to the grade school study of algebra or Latin, they are equally motivational to those of us serving in the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first raised the idea of this bill in January of 2005, soon after I became the ranking member. I know my Democratic colleagues had pushed for it in the 108th Congress at well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, after years of trying, this Congress will succeed in sending this legislation to the President's desk. I know the other body will be taking up a similar provision attached to their bill seeking to fulfill the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. I am very pleased that they will soon join the House in passing this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is this bill so important? The answer lies in the nature of the terrorist threat. Terrorism is an international threat to the democratic way of life. Though we have experienced terrible tragedies of our own, terrorist attacks occur all over the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Terrorists have attacked buses in London; hotels in Israel; trains in Mumbai; embassies in Indonesia; resorts in Bali; and schools in Russia. As the global threat of terrorism is evident, so too is the solution to limiting those attacks. By promoting international cooperation, we will defeat the efforts of our enemies. Cooperation in developing antiterrorism technologies should be a top priority. The different challenges faced by our friends around the world have resulted in new approaches  that the United  States should leverage to protect our citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>International cooperation is nothing new for our country. In fact, the United States has a history of productive scientific and technical collaborations with Israel, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security has participated in some of these partnerships with foreign governments and other entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will encourage and strengthen those efforts and direct the Department to look for new partners beyond those we already have. This includes working with folks in the small business community who can bring exciting technologies to the table.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am especially heartened that the bill will strengthen the means for protecting our Nation from exotic diseases. Active collaborations with scientists in Africa, where many of these diseases originate, should be promoted. This bill encourages that collaboration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too often, the United States presents a posture of unilateralism to the world. I hope that through programs like the ones authorized in this legislation, we encourage a more cooperative approach to fighting terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I strongly support <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill>. I urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill>, the Promoting Antiterrorism Cooperation through Technology and Science Act, a long name for a great bill and an idea whose time clearly has come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The world knows that we changed on the morning of September 11, 2001. We found ourselves raw, exposed, attacked on our own soil, and mourning friends and loved ones killed that tragic morning. We learned the true nature of Islamic militants and the extent of their indiscriminate hatred of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we did not sit by silently, waiting for another attack. We acted, molding our government into a new security-focused body, willing and able to help protect our citizens. And, Mr. Speaker, we partnered with other countries in the global war on terror working to weed out terrorist cells across the globe and stop them before they have a chance to harm anyone else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill today builds on our partnership with international allies, directing the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate international research programs and strategic planning coalitions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill> enhances these cooperative tools to improve our interactions with great allies like Israel, Canada, Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Singapore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we cannot fight the war on terror alone. We need our international partners to stand with us to stop the murderous terrorist groups wherever they spring up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's bill supports and enhances these partnerships, and I am very proud to support it. I urge my colleagues to do the same. I want to commend the chairman of the committee and the ranking member of the committee for their great work on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman and ranking member. I really commend the work that you have done, both Mr. Thompson and Mr. King, in this area of reaching across the aisle and not just speaking about it, but doing something about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very important piece of legislation, <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill>. It has been a product of bipartisan effort and collegial dedication by a lot of people on both sides of the aisle, the staffs of both sides of the aisle, and I am heartened at the process by which the bill has moved forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The commitment of Mr. Thompson and Mr. King to this vitally important legislation has been unwavering, and the collaboration offered epitomizes the very best of what the homeland security can and should be. I was honored to serve on that committee for 4 years, and this is a tremendous achievement to see this proposal move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will help to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security works with our allies in the war on terror to develop and share the best homeland security technologies possible, and we will all be better off because of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, it was not that long ago that several of us went to Europe, to various capitals of Europe, to see what they were doing in terms of homeland security. That proved to be a very productive trip, and we learned from the Brits and from the Spanish and from the Italians, and they learned from us. This is a true collaboration here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill> will establish what we call the Science and Technology Homeland Security International Cooperative Programs Office. Its objective will be to facilitate international cooperative activities throughout the Directorate of Science and Technology within the Department of Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These international cooperative activities will be supported through grants and cooperative agreements, contracts with the U.S. governmental organizations, businesses, federally-funded research and developmental centers, institutions of higher education, and foreign public and private entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill seeks to strengthen ongoing partnerships, as well as encourage new ones. As has been mentioned by both the chairman and the ranking member, the global war on terrorism is one we have joined with with Israel and the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Singapore and many other countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To be sure, the United States could greatly benefit from joint international homeland security development programs between the U.S. and our allies in this war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is this: Many of our allies have substantial experience dealing with terror, and by necessity, they have become op-eds for counterterrorism research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would authorize $25 million for international cooperative activities for each of the fiscal years of 2008 to 2011. Now, that is not a lot of money when we consider the vast array of benefits that such cooperative agreements can produce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Forming these partnerships, Mr. Speaker, and working together in a way that will ultimately help secure America is the main objective of the bill, and it should always be the main objective of this whole body. Passage of this legislation today shows that the House takes this austere responsibility seriously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A final point, Mr. Speaker, if I may, the point of global strategy was at the center of the 9/11 Commission Report, Chapter 12. The Commission made recommendations about global strategy. The kind of partnership and cooperation at the heart of our port security, for instance, is determined by how well the other country where goods and services are coming from will cooperate with us. We can't check every ship that comes into our ports, but we certainly could get the cooperation of other countries  with state-of-the-art science and technology to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I commend, and I do not speak empty or hollow of the work that both Mr. Thompson and Mr. King did.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, first let me tell the gentleman from New Jersey that we miss him on the committee. We miss his charm and his insights and his lively personality and his dedication.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill>. I would like to thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The development and implementation of technology to combat terrorism is critical. The United States and our allies in the war on terror share a common interest in furthering research and development of homeland security-related technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As such, this legislation directs the Department of Homeland Security's research and development arm, the  Science and Technology Division, to coordinate international cooperative programs with our allies in the war on terror to advance this important homeland security research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation implements a 9/11 Commission recommendation that the United States should engage other Nations in developing a comprehensive coalition strategy against Islamic extremists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill> establishes the Science and Technology Homeland Security International Cooperative Programs Office within the Science and Technology Division to promote cooperation between entities of the United States and its allies to engage in cooperative endeavors focused on the research, development and commercialization of high-priority technologies directed at countering acts of terrorism and other high consequence events to address the homeland security needs of Federal, State and local governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill enables the Science and Technology Division within DHS to coordinate with our allies. By encouraging joint research studies, the sharing of scientific and technological information, the training and exchange of scientists and engineers, as well as the joint use of laboratory equipment and facilities, <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill> further directs DHS to collaborate with their strongest allies that include Israel, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Singapore in the development of homeland security  technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is modeled after a partnership created by Congress in 1977 between the United States and Israel. That was called the Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation, also known as the BIRD Foundation. In 29 years, the BIRD Foundation has invested $225 million in 690 cooperative research and development projects mutually beneficial to the United States and to Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill> will facilitate collaboration with countries which have extensive experience in combating terrorism and will enable us to benefit and tailor their technology solutions to address our needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Israel is a country that has developed successful models to mitigate security threats. Most notably, Israel has pioneered efforts and behavioral pattern recognition, also known as BPR. The United States has begun adopting BPR at airports and is now training police and security officers to detect people who are behaving in a suspicious manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is for these reasons that I support <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill>, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I would like to basically thank the gentleman from New York for working with me on the bill, and I encourage all Members to vote "aye" for its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also submit the following exchange of letters for the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TECHNOLOGY,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, February 26, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN, I am writing to you concerning the jurisdictional interest of the Committee on Science and Technology in <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill>, the Promoting Antiterrorism Cooperation through Technology and Science Act. The Committee on Science and Technology has jurisdictional interest in this bill based on the Committee's jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate ("DHS S&amp;T") and other DHS research and development. [See Rule X(o)(14) which grants  the Committee on Science and Technology jurisdiction over "Scientific research, development, and demonstration, and projects therefor."]</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish a "Science and Technology Homeland Security International Cooperative Programs Office." All of the international cooperative activities authorized by the bill relate to homeland security research (e.g., "coordinated research projects, joint research projects, or joint ventures;" "joint studies or technical demonstrations;" "coordinated field exercises, scientific seminars, conferences, symposia, and workshops;" "training  of scientists and engineers;" "visits and exchanges of scientists, engineers, or other appropriate personnel;" "exchanges or sharing of scientific and technological information;" and "joint use of laboratory facilities and equipment"). In addition, the funding for such activities is to be derived from amounts otherwise authorized to DHS S&amp;T.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Committee on Science and Technology acknowledges the importance of <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill> and the need for the legislation to move expeditiously. Therefore, while we have a valid claim to jurisdiction over this bill, I agree not to request a sequential referral. This, of course, is conditional on our mutual understanding that nothing in this legislation or my decision to forgo a sequential referral waives, reduces, or otherwise affects the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science and Technology, and that  a copy of this letter and of your response will be included in the Congressional Record when the bill is considered on the House Floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Committee on Science and Technology also expects that you will support our request to be conferees during any House-Senate conference on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for your attention to this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bart Gordon,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Bennie G. Thompson,</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, February 27, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON: I am writing to you concerning the bill <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill>, the "Promoting Antiterrorism Cooperation through Technology and Science Act." There are certain provisions in the legislation which fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, including provisions relating to programs that may provide appropriated funds to foreign governments and entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the interest of permitting your Committee to proceed expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill, I am willing to waive this Committee's right to sequential referral on this legislation. I do so with the understanding that by waiving consideration of the bill the Committee on Foreign Affairs does not waive, reduce or otherwise affect any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill which fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I request that you support  our efforts to have Members of this Committee named to any conference committee which is formed to consider any such provisions either in this bill or in any other legislation that includes this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please place this letter into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in which you have addressed this matter and I look forward to working with you as <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill> proceeds through the legislative process.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400219" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me again thank Chairman Thompson for his efforts and his cooperation and for his generosity as far as moving this bill forward, and I, again, thank him for that. I think it speaks volumes as to the quality of leadership that he has brought to the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also be remiss if I did not thank staff on our side, Dr. Diane Berry, Colleen O'Keefe and Adam Paulson for their work in bringing this together, and again, bring it to fruition today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, Mr. Speaker, what we are doing today is really a very important continuation of what our governments and other governments have been trying to do. Just several weeks ago, the Secretary of Homeland Security signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Israel's minister of public security, again pledging cooperation. This is codifying that and making clear we want to do more; we want to keep going forward on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank the chairman for his support and his cooperation, and I urge the adoption of <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill>, which establishes the Science and Technology Homeland Security International Cooperative Programs Office. <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill> is an improved version of a similar bill, <bill type="h" number="4942">H.R. 4942</bill>, passed by the House during the 109th Congress. The purpose of these minor, non-substantive changes is to align the House bill more closely with its Senate counterpart, <bill type="s" number="1554">S. 1554</bill>, which will be considered when the Senate takes up <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, which implements the recommendations  of the 9/11 Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill> and <bill type="s" number="1554">S. 1554</bill> is to establish an office charged with promoting cooperation between entities of the United States and its allies in the global war on terrorism in the areas of research, development, and commercialization of high-priority technologies intended to detect, prevent, respond to, recover from, and mitigate against acts of terrorism and other high consequence events. The bill also addresses the homeland security needs of Federal, State, and local governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House bill authorizes $25 million per year for international cooperative activities for the fiscal years 2008 through 2011 and establishes an International Cooperative Programs Office within the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, headed by a Director. The Director is responsible for:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Promoting cooperative research between the U.S. and its allies on homeland security technologies;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Developing strategic priorities for international cooperative activity and addressing them through agreements with foreign entities;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Facilitating the matching of U.S. entities--including small businesses--engaged in homeland security research with appropriate foreign research partners;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ensuring that activities of the office are coordinated with other relevant research agencies; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Planning and executing conferences and workshops to improve contact among technology developers and to help establish direction for future technology goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill> also establishes a Science and Technology Homeland Security International Cooperative Programs Office to facilitate international cooperative activities throughout the Directorate of Science and Technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States currently participates in similar bilateral programs such as the Bi-National Industrial Research and Development--BIRD Foundation--in which the United States and Israel cooperate on defense-related R&amp;D. The office would conduct similar activities, but they would be run by the Department of Homeland Security rather than a private foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Director of the Office reports directly to the Under Secretary for Science and Technology and is responsible for developing understandings and agreements that allow and support international cooperative activity in support of homeland security research, development, and comparative testing. The legislation also makes the Director responsible for developing strategic priorities for international cooperative activity in support of homeland security research, development, and comparative testing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Mr. Speaker, facilitating international cooperative activity to address strategic priorities through appropriate mechanisms such as grants, cooperative agreements or contracts with foreign public or private entities is another important objective that this legislation prudently vests in the Director. The Director shall also be mandated to identify and match domestic entities engaged in homeland security research with foreign entities so that they may partner in homeland security research activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the Director is obligated to work toward bringing about the coordination of the Department's international cooperative activities with the activities of other relevant research agencies and to holding international homeland security technology workshops and conferences. These international cooperative activities are to be supported through grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts with Federal governmental organizations, businesses--including small businesses, federally funded research  and development centers, institutions of higher education, and foreign and private entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill would encourage equal partnership by requiring that the foreign partner equitably match U.S. funding expended through direct funding or funding of complementary activities, or through provision of staff, facilities, material, or equipment. It strengthens ongoing partnerships and encourages new ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, partnerships are encouraged with the nations of Africa to facilitate the development of information sharing and other types of collaboration to strengthen American preparedness against threats to our Nation's agricultural sector and public health from exotic diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Mr. Speaker, I strongly support <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill> and urge my colleagues to do so as well.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400231" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill>, and I commend the gentlemen from New York and Mississippi for moving this legislation forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the war on terrorists, we are often racing against our enemies as they develop new threats and we develop new countermeasures. This has been true throughout the history of warfare and it remains true today, whether we are talking about improvised explosive devices, shoe bombs, or attacks using chlorine gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this competition to combat new threats, cooperation on science and technology with our allies is a key force multiplier, and I commend the gentlemen for moving forward with this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we have to make sure that these cooperative programs are properly coordinated and consistent with existing programs and law. I believe that before the Department of Homeland Security initiates a new program, the Secretary of State should be in full agreement with the proposed cooperation to ensure that there is no duplication of efforts with State Department anti-terrorism efforts. In addition, this new framework should recognize that:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In accordance with section 622(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Secretary of State is responsible "for continuous supervision and general direction" of U.S. foreign assistance;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In accordance with section 504 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, fiscal year 1979, the Secretary of State shall have primary responsibility for coordination and oversight with respect to all major science or science and technology agreements and activities between the United States and foreign countries; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In accordance with the Case-Zablocki Act, no international agreement may be signed or otherwise concluded without prior consultation by the Secretary of State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I do not believe that <bill type="h" number="844">H.R. 844</bill> is inconsistent with coordination with the Secretary of State or with these authorities and requirements, I look forward to working with the gentleman from Mississippi and gentleman from New York as <bill type="h" number="844">H.R. 844</bill> moves forward on legislative language to provide for a specific role for the Secretary of State in this process and to reflect these existing authorities. And I appreciate the gentlemen's willingness to work with me on these issues.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill> to establish a Science and Technology Homeland Security International Cooperative Programs Office. In an ongoing effort to promote effective methods of addressing antiterrorism, this legislation would establish a Science Technology Homeland Security International Cooperative Programs Office to facilitate international cooperative activities throughout the Directorate of Science and Technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Terrorism is no longer confined to one country. It is now a threat to international security. The means, missions and motives of terrorism have changed, forcing the counter-terrorism community to react accordingly. Our strategies and implementations, in order to be more effective, need to be global. The most disturbing developments have been a growing partnership in organized crime between countries. As a result, and since the 9/11 attacks, the international community has focused on the issue  of terrorism with renewed intensity. Gathering,  coordinating and sharing of information among the international community is a critical effort to prevent and combat terrorism. <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill> creates this opportunity by facilitating international cooperative activity that encourages international partnerships in the fight against terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is important that we join our allies on and off the battlefield. Terrorism is a global phenomenon that requires a coordinated global response. <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill> provides a global response to terrorism. This legislation was passed in the House during the 109th Congress and I urge my colleagues to support it again.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="884">H.R. 884</bill>, the PACTS Act, I am pleased we are moving quickly and considering this legislation, which implements a key 9/11 Commission recommendation that "the United States should engage other nations in developing a comprehensive coalition strategy against Islamist terrorism."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill enables the Department of Homeland Security to join forces with our closest international allies to develop homeland security technologies and share scientific information to help prevent terrorist attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As co-chairman of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission Caucus, I know how important it is to implement the core recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and to hold the administration and relevant Federal agencies accountable to implement them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge the support of this legislation.</paragraph>
