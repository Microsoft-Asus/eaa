  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="RECOGNITION OF DR. MARY STRANAHAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Dr. Mary Stranahan. Dr. Stranahan is a retired medical doctor and an active philanthropist who lives in Arlee, MT. Arlee is a small town in western Montana located on the Flathead Indian Reservation in Lake County. Arlee is a place of incredible physical beauty, like so many places in Montana. But amid the beauty are poverty and economic challenges. Lake County ranks as one of the poorest counties in Montana. In her years as a practicing  family physician in Lake County and on the reservation, Mary saw first-hand the relationship between limited economic opportunity and family health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since retiring from medicine, Dr. Stranahan has become immersed in the survival and success of local agriculture and mainstreet businesses. She knows agriculture and small business play a vital role in healthy rural communities. Over the years, Dr. Stranahan has, as a concerned individual, been a core donor for innumerable charities and non-profits in Montana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this year Dr. Stranahan is taking her philanthropic commitment to a whole new level in chartering the Montana Good Works Foundation. This new Montana foundation will work to focus Dr. Stranahan's grants and donations on social justice, rural community development, and sustainable business development in Montana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In one of the Montana Good Works Foundation's first gifts, Dr. Stranahan has shown extraordinary leadership by giving $1.42 million to the Montana Community Development Corporation. This gift kicks off MCDC's campaign to grow its loan fund for Montana businesses to $15 million and it empowers MCDC to expand its business coaching services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Stranahan has further committed to help Montana Community Development Corporation recruit more philanthropists to this important effort to build entrepreneurship in Montana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Dr. Stranahan for her great leadership in rural philanthropy. The Big Sky Institute reports that rural States like Montana are on the short end of a great disparity in foundation grant-making. The Big Sky Institute found that, adjusting for population, foundation grants to rural States are less than a fifth of the national average. After adjusting for population, foundation grants to rural States are less than a tenth of the amount received in the State of New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last May, I spoke to the annual conference of the Council on Foundations in Pittsburgh, PA. I challenged foundations to double their grant-making to rural States within 5 years. And I am working with leaders in the nonprofit and foundations communities to convene a rural philanthropy conference in Missoula this August. I am proud of the progress we are making in rural philanthropy. And I look forward to working together with Montana philanthropists like Dr. Stranahan to keep the ball rolling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud Dr. Stranahan for the vision and the scope of her philanthropy. In particular, I commend her commitment to building rural entrepreneurs as a core philanthropic strategy. Dr. Stranahan is one of the new Montana leaders who are showing the world that Montana truly deserves its designation as the Treasure State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize and commend Dr. Mary Stranahan for her substantial efforts on behalf of Montana's communities and Montana's future.</paragraph>
