    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I'm somewhat puzzled over an event held on Monday this week. The Government of Russia, the Government of China, and a U.N. agency gathered for a conference entitled "Exploring Cooperative Approaches to Security in Space." I find this fascinating, "Cooperative Approaches to Security in Space"; yet China, with Russia and India's help, is almost single-handedly propping up the brutal dictatorship of Burma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a brutal dictatorship that uses ethnic minorities as human land mine sweepers, has destroyed 3,000 villages and has the highest number of child soldiers in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps China, Russia, and the U.N. should help bring democracy to Burma, which would bring security and stability to that country, before trying to  bring security in space. The suffering people of Burma deserve better, but apparently the Chinese and Russian Governments don't think so.</paragraph>
