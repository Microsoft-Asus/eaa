  <narrative>ORDERLY AND RESPONSIBLE IRAQ REDEPLOYMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--MOTION TO PROCEED -- (Senate - November 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14591">S14591</bill>]</narrative>
  <chair> Under the previous order, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.</chair>
  <narrative>The legislative clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Cloture Motion</narrative>
  <narrative>We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="4156">H.R. 4156</bill>, the Orderly and Responsible Iraq Redeployment Appropriations Act, 2008.</narrative>
  <chair> There will now be 2 minutes, with the time equally divided. Who seeks time?</chair>
  <chair>The assistant majority leader is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, what will it take to end this war? How many lives? How many limbs? How many broken families? How many innocent victims?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate has an opportunity, with this next vote, to start to bring this war to an end and to start to bring our soldiers home in an orderly, responsible way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know the President will not do this. But it is within our power, our authority, and our responsibility under the Constitution to do it. A vote now to move forward on this House appropriations bill will bring this war to an end in an orderly, responsible way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues, do not shirk your responsibility. Do not be on the wrong side of history.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Who seeks time?</chair>
  <chair>The Senator from Alabama is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this summer, we had grim numbers coming out of Iraq and we had an election and we went through a soul-searching analysis of what to do. By an 80-to-14 vote, this Senate voted to send General Petraeus to Iraq and give him a chance to succeed. We had his full report in September. We had other reports from General Jones and GAO, and we concluded to continue this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent weeks, progress has exceeded what we could have expected possible. This is not the right time to tie the hands of our military leaders. It is not the right thing to do--to leave any doubt that we are going to support the troops we have sent into harm's way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge colleagues to not leave our troops in uncertainty and stand firm with a policy that seems to be working. Let's continue to monitor it. If it fails, we need to know that. But, right now, things are going well, and it would be wrong to undermine that in any way.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> All time has expired. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call is waived.</chair>
  <chair>The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="4156">H.R. 4156</bill>, a bill making emergency supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a close?</chair>
  <chair>The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.</chair>
  <narrative>The clerk will call the roll.</narrative>
  <narrative>The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).</paragraph>

  <chair> Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote?</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, at the request of the distinguished majority  leader, and as the only Democrat who voted against cloture on the motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="4156">H.R. 4156</bill>, the Orderly and Responsible Iraq redeployment Appropriations Bill, I have entered this motion to reconsider so that the Senate may have another opportunity to vote on this matter. Only Senators who voted no on this matter are able under Senate rules to ask for another vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am undertaking this procedural matter at the Leader's request and out of my respect for him. I am happy to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I want to make clear that should there be another cloture vote on <bill type="h" number="4156">H.R. 4156</bill> or similar legislation, my position will remain the same--I will vote no. I am opposed to providing any additional funding for the war in Iraq unless there is a firm and enforceable deadline for the redeployment of our forces from Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My views on the ongoing failed policy in Iraq are included in the RECORD earlier in the day at the time of the original vote and I urge my colleagues to take the opportunity to review my concerns about our continued involvement in a civil war which has no military solutions.</paragraph>
