    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in his first speech in the British Parliament in 1789 describing the slave trade, William Wilberforce concluded by telling his colleagues this: "Having heard all of this you may choose to look the other way, but you can never again say you did not know."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>None of us can say that we do not know about the Nation's long-term financial outlook, which former Comptroller General David Walker said will result in a tsunami of spending debt level that will swamp our ship of state. It is time that this Congress and this administration and Secretary Paulson wake up to the massive debt that we are amassing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Jim Cooper and I are working together on a bipartisan plan called the SAFE Commission, where 78 colleagues are with us. If there are other bipartisan solutions that you all have, put them on the table and let's get them discussed. It will take the leadership on a Wilberforce level from both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know what is happening, and for the sake of our children and our grandchildren, we must not look the other way. Wilberforce said, and I close, having heard all of this, you may choose to look the other way, but you can never again say you did not know.</paragraph>
