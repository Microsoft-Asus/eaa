  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 12:30 today, at which time we will break for the Democratic caucus. As was indicated yesterday, the Republicans are having a retreat at the Library of Congress today. When we come back at 2:15, the Senate will resume consideration of the Indian health bill. There were some amendments offered yesterday, some debated yesterday. We could not arrange a vote yesterday. I do not expect any votes on this bill this afternoon.  I have been in close touch with Senator Dorgan. He is trying to work this out so we can complete this legislation quickly. If there are any amendments that Democratic Senators have, I hope they would come and offer them today. That way we can prioritize how we are going to move through this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as I indicated yesterday, we are going to, this evening, start on the FISA legislation to complete that. We are going to finish that legislation this week. That means we are going to have all day tomorrow and all day Friday and, hopefully, not all day Saturday. But we need to finish this legislation. It is critically important. It is not fair to jam the House. Since we have been refused an extension by the Republicans, we need to finish this legislation now, send it to the House,  have a conference, and see what we can come back with as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I indicated, it is not fair to do as we did last August and send something to the House: Take it or leave it. We are not going to do that. That is why I am not going to wait until next week to go to this legislation. We have to complete it now. There are strong feelings on both sides of this issue. As I have indicated on a number of occasions, I do not support the immunity provisions that are in the Intelligence bill, but it appears that a majority of the Senate does. That being the case,  those people who want to amend the Intelligence bill with that information and that legislation we have from the Judiciary Committee will offer that. I hope they will do it as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a number of other issues other than immunity. I have spoken to Senator Feinstein. She says she has something dealing with immunity she wants to offer. She wants to offer something with exclusivity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a number of other things we need to do. As I have indicated, I would hope that if somebody does not like an amendment, they would move to table that amendment and not try to talk it to death because that being the case, we are going to have to let them talk during the evening. We are not going to have a gentlemen's agreement on: OK, so you don't want this to go forward; we are not going to let it go forward. We are going to complete this legislation as quickly as we can.</paragraph>
