    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our guest chaplain, Dr. Billy Franklin Hudgins. Dr. Hudgins has served selflessly as a pastor in Louisiana, South Carolina, and now in the district I represent in Alabama where he's the senior pastor of Cross Creek Community Church of Hokes Bluff, Alabama.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to pastoral work, Dr. Hudgins has also been very involved with both State and national church leadership organizations. Among the honors he's received, he's served as president of the Alabama Baptist Convention Pastors Conference. He also served as trustee of the International Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Hudgins has been a teacher and a coach over the course of his career. He has spent 5 years as a bi-vocational pastor and 35 years in churches belonging to the Southern Baptist Convention. If that wasn't enough, at a time when others look toward retirement, at the age of 60, Dr. Bill Hudgins helped start the church he currently serves in Hokes Bluff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Hudgins is joined in Washington today by his wife, Connie, with whom he'll be celebrating 46 years of marriage in a matter of weeks. I'm honored to welcome Dr. Billy Hudgins as our guest here in the United States House of Representatives this morning as someone who is a servant and has spent his career as a follower of Jesus, and one who has helped others do the same along life's way.</paragraph>
