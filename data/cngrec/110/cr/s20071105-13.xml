    <paragraph>Mr. President, section 307 of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, the 2008 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels for legislation, including one or more bills and amendments, that reauthorizes the 2002 farm bill or similar or related programs, provides for revenue changes, or any combination thereof. Section 307 authorizes the revisions provided that certain conditions are met, including that amounts  provided in the legislation for the above purposes not exceed $20 billion over the period of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 and that the legislation not worsen the deficit over the period of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2017.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate is considering an amendment in the nature of a substitute to <bill type="h" number="2419">H.R. 2419</bill> that consolidates the following: <bill type="s" number="2302">S. 2302</bill>, the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007, which was reported by the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry on November 2, 2007; <bill type="s" number="2242">S. 2242</bill>, the Heartland, Habitat, Harvest, and Horticulture Act of 2007, which was reported by the Senate Committee on Finance on October 25, 2007; and a number of technical and other corrections made to both bills. I find that  the consolidated legislation satisfies the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund for the farm bill. I am pleased to report to the Senate that this legislation is fully paid for over both the 2007 through 2012 time period and the 2007 through 2017 time period. Therefore, pursuant to section 307, I am adjusting the aggregates in the 2008 budget resolution, as well as the allocation provided to the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have the following revisions to <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill> printed in the Record.</paragraph>
