    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I stand, once again, before this body with yet another Sunset Memorial. It is March 31, 2008, in the land of the free and the home of the brave. And before the sun sets today in America, almost 4,000 more defenseless, unborn children were killed by abortion on demand. That's just today, Mr. Speaker. That is more than the number of innocent American lives that were lost on September 11 times 15,000, the total number that were lost on September 11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has now been exactly 12,852 days since the travesty called Roe v. Wade was handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million of our own children. Some of them, Mr. Speaker, died and cried and screamed as they died. But because it was amniotic fluid passing over the vocal cords rather than air, we couldn't hear them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of them had at least four things in common. They were each just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone. Each one of them died a nameless and lonely death. And each of their mothers, whether she realizes it or not, will never be the same. And all of the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity are lost forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, even in the full glare of such tragedy, this generation clings to blind, invincible ignorance while history repeats itself and our own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims to date: those yet unborn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, perhaps it's important for those in this chamber to remind ourselves again of why we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson said, "The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The phrase in the 14th amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution. It says: "No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional rights is why we are all here. It is our sworn oath.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bedrock foundation of this Republic is that clarion declaration of the self-evident truth that all human beings are created equal and they are endowed by their Creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every conflict our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core, self-evident truth. It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world. It is who we are. And yet, Mr. Speaker, another day has passed. And we in this body have failed again to honor that foundational commitment. We failed our sworn oath, and we failed our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with the nearly 4,000 more innocent American babies who died today without the protection that we should have  given them. And it seems so sad, Mr. Speaker, to me that this Sunset Memorial may be the only remembrance that these children who died today will ever have in this Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so just as small a gesture as it might be, I would ask those who are inclined for just a moment of silence at this time for these little, lost Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me conclude in the hope that perhaps someone new who hears this Sunset Memorial tonight will finally realize that abortion really does kill little babies, that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express and that 12,852 days spent killing nearly 15 million children in America is enough and that the America that rejected human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi Holocaust is still courageous and compassionate enough to find a better way for mothers and their  babies than abortion on demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So tonight, Mr. Speaker, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are also numbered and that all too soon, each of us will walk through these chambers for the very last time. And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on yet another day to come, may that be the day when we finally hear the cries of the innocent unborn. May that be the day when we finally find the humanity, the courage, and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional  duty to protect the least of these, our tiny American brothers and sisters, from this murderous scourge upon our Nation called abortion on demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is March 31, 2008, 12,852 days since Roe v. Wade first stained the foundation of this Nation with the blood of its own children. This, in the land of the free and the home of the brave.</paragraph>
