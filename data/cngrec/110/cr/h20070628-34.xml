    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise so that we can note this important moment, and that moment is that, although it is with great sadness for this Chamber and the members of the Massachusetts delegation, but I think great joy for his family, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Meehan) is about to cast his final vote as a Member of this Chamber, and I would like to give the gentleman the proper farewell that he deserves because he has served well and long in this institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400269" topic="WISHING FAREWELL TO THE HON. MARTIN MEEHAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman and I thank the dean of our delegation and all of my colleagues from Massachusetts and all of my colleagues in this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a plane to catch, so I will be brief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my wife, Ellen, and my wonderful family for all that they have had to tolerate over the years. I want to thank the people of the Fifth Congressional District of Massachusetts for the confidence that they have demonstrated in me in giving me this great honor to serve in this great institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank former staff members of mine, some of whom are here, for their dedication, their energy, their hard work day in and day out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, that I have worked with. I have tried to work in a bipartisan way most of the time. I leave this House; it was the most difficult decision professionally that I have ever had to make because I love this House, I love the institution, I love the friendships and colleagues that I have been so honored to work with over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I also believe in the University of Massachusetts at Lowell. That is where I graduated. I walked in the door, one of seven children in a large family in Lowell, Massachusetts, and wouldn't have had the opportunity to go to college or to achieve things I wanted to achieve in my life without that institution. So as difficult as it is, I have a passion for the institution. I am going to leave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So thank you very much for wonderful friendships. I will be back from time to time. Be careful you don't eliminate too many earmarks while you are at it here.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412208" topic="ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to voice my concerns about the way taxpayer funds have recently been spent at the General Services Administration (GSA). Today, the House is expected to pass <bill type="h" number="2829">H.R. 2829</bill>, a bill which makes appropriations for financial services and general government for Fiscal Year 2008, and which provides funding for the GSA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If any agency should be trusted to spend American taxpayers' money responsibly, it is the GSA, the federal government's premier acquisition agency. Unfortunately, reports that current GSA Administrator Lurita Doan used federal government property and resources to engage in partisan campaign activities with political appointees of the GSA provide evidence that the head of this agency has placed the interests of the Republican party over the interests of the American public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 26, 2007 Ms. Doan attended a meeting at GSA at which J. Scott Jennings, the Special Assistant to the President and the Deputy Director of Political Affairs at the White House, gave a 28-page PowerPoint presentation which reviewed the 2006 election results and outlined the Republican party's top targets in upcoming elections. According to several witnesses who attended the meeting, after this presentation Ms. Doan asked the more than 30 political appointees in attendance how they could  use GSA resources to help Republican candidates win future elections. This presentation and Ms. Doan's comments are not only blatant violations of the Hatch Act, which restricts the political activities of Executive Branch employees, but are also a gross abuse of taxpayers' money and trust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Doan has appeared twice before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and claims that she cannot remember Mr. Jennings' presentation, or the comments she made. Despite the fact that the Office of Special Counsel found that Ms. Doan "violated the Hatch Act's prohibition against using [her] official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election when [she] solicited over thirty subordinate employees to engage in political activity,"  she also claims that she cannot answer questions about the legality or appropriateness of the briefing. In light of Ms. Doan's lack of contrition and apparent confusion about what constitutes an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars, it is understandable that many of us in the Congress would be concerned about the way the funds we are appropriating today to GSA will be used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I support the passage of this bill, I believe that we must continue to work to ensure that appropriated GSA funds are spent on legal and legitimate purposes--like managing federal buildings, buying government equipment and supplies, and working with other agencies to purchase goods and services for the government. I hope and trust that the funds we are appropriating to GSA today will be spent legally and responsibly, and I look forward to continuing our Congressional oversight of the GSA.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2829">H.R. 2829</bill>, the Financial Services--General Government Appropriations bill. This bill enhances key American priorities, while providing less overall than the President requested for agencies in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are committed to making our tax system fairer for millions of Americans--and to enhance enforcement to make sure everyone pays what they owe, not just those who play by the rules, while improving taxpayers' services. This bill will spur job creation and make the economy work for everyone--by restoring the President's cuts in small business loans, rejecting his efforts to slash capital and financial services available to underserved communities (CDFI), and by strengthening consumer protections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are also working to make sure that every vote counts in our elections, and to strengthen law enforcement, both against terrorism and in the war on drugs. This bill meets two key commitments of this Congress: it has complete transparency on its earmarks, and it also cuts the amount for earmarks in the bill in half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill lowers the cost of Small Business 7(a) loans and rejects the President's proposal to stop this program that helps small businesses start-up and grow. The 7(a) loan program accounts for roughly 30 percent of all long-term small business borrowing in America, and is the only source of affordable, long-term financing for many of our Nation's small businesses, including many in South Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm pleased that the bill includes greater access to capital for economic development in disadvantaged and rural communities. We reject the President's proposal to cut by 50 percent the availability of credit, capital and financial services to underserved communities through the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. Instead, our bill provides $46 million more than last year to support economic development and financial services in disadvantaged and rural communities through housing  loans, micro-business loans, community development banks and credit unions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report lists the recipient and the sponsor for each earmark contained in the bill. Of the 165 earmarks in the bill, 148 were requested by lawmakers and 17 by President Bush. Furthermore, each sponsor has filed a certification that the sponsor and the sponsor's spouse have no financial interest in the earmark, which is publicly available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased the committee included funding for the University of Texas at Brownsville's International Trade Center. Brownsville has always been the front door to international trade given its proximity to Mexico and the land and sea ports in the city. This funding will be used to establish an International Trade Center at the UTB International Technology Education and Commerce Campus (ITECC) which will house all of the services required to conduct international trade including: international  law, accounting, banking, insurance, logistics services, export-import marketing services, U.S. customs, government trade services and industry showrooms for specific target sectors such as medical, communications, and computer technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By concentrating all of the components for trade in one location the ITC will generate significantly higher levels of international trade and associated jobs in Brownsville, making this an excellent investment in South Texas and the Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise and report the bill back to the House with sundry amendments, with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The motion was agreed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mrs. Tauscher) having assumed the chair, Mr. Hastings of Florida, Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (<bill type="h" number="2829">H.R. 2829</bill>) making appropriations for financial services and general government for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes, he reported the bill back to the House with sundry amendments,  with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400239" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the purpose of this motion to recommit is simple. It recommits the bill back to committee to make clear that the funding provided to the IRS in this bill is only available to administer, implement, and enforce existing tax laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority party's budget plan includes implementing the biggest tax  increase in history, and this motion would prevent that from taking place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the economy is not functioning perfectly, the indicators show that the economy is strong. GDP in 2006 was 3.4 percent above 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Capital investment increased by 6.8 percent in 2006. Unemployment is at 4.6 percent. Tax receipts increased by 11.8 percent in fiscal year 2006, on top of fiscal year 2005's increase of 14.6 percent. So while Congress and the administration have lowered taxes, the economy has grown and the tax revenues have increased. Implementing new tax increases, as the majority party's budget proposes, will have a chilling effect on our economy and the American family as more of their hard-earned money comes  to Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the deficit, which is estimated to be $244 billion in fiscal year 2007, is very troubling, tax collections are at an all-time high. Instead of increasing taxes to address the deficit and possibly reversing economic growth and further burdening the American family, I believe we must put more focus on controlling spending, both mandatory spending, and discretionary programs as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This motion will prohibit the IRS from implementing new taxes, protecting the American family and our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge a "yes" vote on the motion to recommit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400366" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>I realize that with a house full of colleagues, I should make a profound and eloquent statement, but here it goes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to point out to the Members of the House that adoption of the motion to recommit offered by the gentleman from California will kill the bill. The motion instructs the committee to report the bill back promptly rather than forthwith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, section 1002(b) of the House manual states, "Unlike the case of the motion to recommit with instructions to report back forthwith, the adoption of which occasions an immediate report on the floor, the adoption of a motion to recommit with instructions to report back promptly sends the bill to committee, whose eventual report, if any, would not be immediately before the House."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, a vote for this motion to recommit kills the bill. A vote against the motion will allow the bill to go forward to final passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge prompt defeat of the motion to recommit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit.</chair>
