  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I voice my deep disappointment with the recent Supreme Court decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Women, on average, are paid less than their male counterparts. For women of color, the pay is much less. Unless you can look me in the eye and say that women are less intelligent, less capable than their male counterparts in the same fields, the most glaring explanation for this discrepancy is discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have made great strides in working to equalize wages for all Americans regardless of gender, race or age. But the decision last week to limit a worker's available recourse in the face of discrimination is a setback to all of our civil rights, and reminds us of how far we still have to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we must mobilize. To fix this disparity, we must move forward and correct the law so this misinterpretation will never occur again. I urge my colleagues to support a legislative remedy to preserve a worker's right to be compensated for discrimination.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
