  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; With respect to the parcel of real property in Marion County, Oregon, deeded by the United States to the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon by quitclaim deed dated June 18, 2002, and recorded in the public records of Marion County on June 19, 2002, Congress finds that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) the parcel of land described in the quitclaim deed, comprising approximately 19.86 acres of land originally used as part of the Chemawa Indian School, was transferred by the United States in 1973 and 1974 to the State of Oregon for use for highway and associated road projects;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Interstate Route 5 and the Salem Parkway were completed, and in 1988 the Oregon Department of Transportation deeded the remaining acreage of the parcel back to the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) the United States could no longer use the returned acreage for the administration of Indian affairs, and determined it would be most appropriate to transfer the property to the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) on request of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon, the United States transferred the parcel jointly to the Tribes for economic development and other purposes under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.);&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) the transfer of the parcel was memorialized by the United States in 2 documents, including--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) an agreement titled "Agreement for Transfer of Federally Owned Buildings, Improvements, Facilities and/or Land from the United States of America the [sic] Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Tribe [sic] of Oregon", dated June 21, 2001; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) a quitclaim deed dated June 18, 2002, and recorded in the public records of Marion County, Oregon, on June 19, 2002 (reel 1959, page 84);&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) use of the parcel by Tribes for economic development purposes is consistent with the intent and language of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.) and other Federal Indian law--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) to encourage tribal economic development; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) to promote economic self-sufficiency for Indian tribes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) the United States does not desire the return of the parcel and does not intend under any circumstances to take action under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.) or any other legal authority to seek the return of the parcel; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) in reliance on this intent, the Tribes have committed over $2,500,000 to infrastructure improvements to the parcel, including roads and sewer and water systems, and have approved plans to further develop the parcel for economic purposes, the realization of which is dependent on the ability of the Tribes to secure conventional financing.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. WAIVER OF APPLICATION OF INDIAN SELF-DETERMINATION AND EDUCATION ASSISTANCE ACT.</narrative>
  <narrative> (a) Nonapplication of Law.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.) shall not apply to the transfer of the parcel of real property in Marion County, Oregon, deeded by the United States to the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon by quitclaim deed dated June 18, 2002, and recorded in the public records of Marion County on  June 19, 2002.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) New Deed.--The Secretary of the Interior shall issue a new deed to the Tribes to the parcel described in subsection (a) that shall not include--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) any restriction on the right to alienate the parcel; or&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) any reference to any provision of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.).</narrative>
  <narrative> (c) Prohibition on Gaming.--Class II gaming and class III gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) shall not be conducted on the parcel described in subsection (a).&lt;ul&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act has frequently been hailed as one of the most important pieces of Federal Indian legislation. Despite the success of this law, in this instance, the law is impeding two Tribes located in Oregon and their efforts to engage in non-gaming economic development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this case, the Secretary of the Interior transferred approximately 20 acres of land to these tribes via a quitclaim deed. But because it was transferred pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination Act, it contains a reversionary clause. This clause requires the land to revert back to the United States if the land is not used for economic development purposes. Although the Tribes intend to use the land for economic development purposes, they are unable to obtain conventional financing because  of the reversionary clause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Smith of Oregon introduced <bill type="s" number="375">S. 375</bill> to address this issue and our colleague Representative Darlene Hooley is the sponsor of an identical measure in this body. The legislation simply directs the Secretary of the Interior to reissue a quitclaim deed that is not subject to the Indian Self-Determination Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</paragraph>
