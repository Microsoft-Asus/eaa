    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of House Resolution 354 offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Deal) to recognize the year 2007 as the official 50th anniversary celebration of Lake Sidney Lanier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress first authorized the construction of Buford Dam in 1946 as one project in a comprehensive plan to develop our Nation's water resources for the purposes of national defense, power production, flood control, navigation, and water supply. The first groundbreaking for construction occurred on March 1, 1950, and on June 17, 1957, the first hydropower was produced by the generators of the dam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Lake Lanier provides power production, flood control, water supply, navigation, fish and wildlife management, and recreational activities to members of the surrounding communities and businesses. This week in June is a suitable time to recognize Lake Lanier's contributions to the area and accomplishments. As summer heat begins to spread across the Nation, both water supply and cooling water recreational activities are on many minds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 60 percent of the population of the State of Georgia relies on water stored in Lake Lanier or down the Chattahoochee River. Similarly, properties around the lake and down the river rely on its banks and dam for flood control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 8 million visitors come annually to appreciate the scenery and leisure opportunities provided by the lake. In fact, Lake Lanier holds the title of the most-visited Army Corps lake in the entire country. Facilities include 10 marinas and 57 parks for swimming, boating, fishing and picnicking. In 1996, Lake Lanier hosted the paddling and rowing competitions for the Summer Olympics in Atlanta.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And several years ago, the Marine Trade Association of Metro Atlanta found that Lake Lanier has an economic impact of $5.5 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join with me and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Deal) in supporting House Resolution 354 to honor the impacts, accomplishments and continuing success of Lake Lanier on its 50th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today we recognize the 50th anniversary of Lake Sidney Lanier, an Army Corps of Engineers facility located in the State of Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lake Lanier is one of 464 lakes in 43 States constructed and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation is blessed with considerable water resources that support our Nation's economy and quality of life. We need water for our homes, farms and factories. Water also supports navigation, generates power and sustains our environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress authorized the Buford Dam Project in 1946 just after the end of the Second World War. Groundbreaking for the project began in 1950. Constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Lake Lanier is a multipurpose, 38,000-acre lake that provides flood protection, power production, water supply, navigation, recreation, and fish and wildlife management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nestled in the foothills of the Georgia Blue Ridge Mountains, Lake Sidney Lanier is one of America's favorite lakes. Over 7.5 million people a year choose to visit Lake Lanier. With over 692 miles of shoreline, the lake is well known for its aqua-blue colored water, spectacular scenery and variety of recreational activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When completed, the total cost of construction, including land acquisition, was almost $45 million. When the gates of the dam were closed in 1956, it took more than 3 years for the lake to reach its normal elevation of 1,070 feet above sea level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The lake is named for one of the Nation's most famous poets, Sidney Lanier. Born in Georgia in 1842, Mr. Lanier entered Oglethorpe College at 14 years of age, graduating at the top of his class in 1860.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While serving on the blockade runner "Lucy" during the Civil War, Mr. Lanier was captured and contracted tuberculosis while imprisoned in Maryland. Following the Civil War, Mr. Lanier played the flute for the Peabody Symphony and lectured at Johns Hopkins University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While he is known for works like "The Harlequin of Dreams," "In Absence," "Acknowledgement," and "Sunrise," he is best remembered for "The Song of the Chattahoochee," an enduring legacy for the native Georgian.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of our Members to support this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="354">H. Res. 354</bill>, recognizing the year 2007 as the official 50th anniversary celebration of the beginnings of marinas, power production, recreation, and boating on Lake Sidney Lanier, Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lake Lanier is named after Sidney Clopton Lanier, a poet and musician who was born in Macon, Georgia, in 1842. After participating in battle during the Civil War, and being captured and imprisoned in Point Lookout, Maryland, Mr. Lanier contracted tuberculosis, which would affect him for the rest of his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Lanier's life was one of practicality and beauty: while he practiced law to support his wife and four children, he was also the first flutist in the Peabody Orchestra in Baltimore, Maryland, and an accomplished poet. The Lake was named after Mr. Lanier because of the way he positively portrayed the Chattahoochee River in his poetry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, Lake Lanier itself is a symbol of both practicality and beauty. It provides crucial flood control, protecting approximately $2 billion worth of property in the surrounding area. Similarly, on June 16, 1957--50 years ago this week--Buford Dam began producing power for the first time. Hydropower continues to flow from these waters to this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the lake is one of 464 lakes constructed and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, it has won the annual award for "best operated lake" for three separate years: 1990, 1997, and 2002.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the flood control, water supply, and power production role of Lake Lanier may be critical to the continuing livelihood of the communities in the surrounding area, the lake also provides beautiful scenery and recreational opportunities that local citizens and visiting tourists enjoy. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates that more than 7.5 million people visit the 692 miles of lake shoreline each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join with me in recognizing the 50th anniversary of Lake Lanier.</paragraph>
