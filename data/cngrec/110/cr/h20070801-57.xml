    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 597 provides for consideration of the conference report to accompany <bill type="h" number="1495">H.R. 1495</bill>, the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. The rule waives all points of order against the conference report and its consideration and considers the conference report as read.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it has been well-documented that our country has not had a WRDA bill in over 7 years. Seven years is perilously close to an entire generation passing without a national water resources policy being signed into law by the President. We are taking a big step in that direction today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>WRDA authorizes upwards of $20 billion for the construction of water resource development projects and studies by the Army Corps of Engineers for flood control, navigation, and environmental restoration. Additionally, <bill type="h" number="1495">H.R. 1495</bill> authorizes hurricane recovery activities along the gulf coast that would cost an estimated $2 billion. Furthermore, the bill requires an external peer review for studies and projects that would cost more than $45 million. The bill also coordinates environmental analyses  and other permit processes among Federal and State agencies and authorizes environmental quality initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district in Sacramento, California, this WRDA bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation that will pass Congress this year. We have been waiting a long time for this bill. Sacramento is the most at-risk river city for catastrophic flooding. Located at the confluence of the Sacramento and American Rivers, the Sacramento floodplain contains: 165,000 homes; over 488,000 residents; 1,300 government facilities, including the State capitol; and businesses providing 200,000 jobs.  It is a hub of a six-county regional economy that provides 800,000 jobs for 1.5 million people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A major flood along the American River or the Sacramento River would have catastrophic ripple effects regionally and nationally; cost upwards of $35 billion in direct property damages; and likely would result in significant loss of life to our families, friends, and neighbors. In my district we understand the need and urgency for an overarching water resources policy to protect our homes, businesses, and families. Sacramento needs this bill, but so  do  countless other communities across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, the projects and policy it contains, goes a long way in addressing our country's flood vulnerabilities. Nationally, regions across the country are starving for a Federal partner in water resources policy. Our country is confronted with population growth, climate change, and growing demands on our water infrastructure. Our districts across the country need this bill, and the Members in this Chamber have repeatedly supported WRDA bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 108th Congress, WRDA passed the House by a vote of 412-8. In the 109th Congress, WRDA passed the House 406-14. In the 110th Congress, WRDA passed the House 394-25.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a strong history of support and bipartisanship for WRDA bills. It is my hope that this support continues and that we move forward on this very important work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to congratulate and thank Water Resources Environment Subcommittee Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson and full committee Chairman Jim Oberstar for their commitment to make this bill a priority in the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I want to make a point that WRDA bills are traditionally intended to be 2-year authorization bills. It is important that we get our water policy back on track and address these ongoing challenges on a regular basis. It is my belief that the best protection that we can provide our communities is to be prepared. I look forward to passing this WRDA conference report and moving on to the next WRDA bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to support this rule and final passage of the conference report to accompany <bill type="h" number="1495">H.R. 1495</bill>, the Water Resources Development Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Washington">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <narrative>(Mr. HASTINGS of Washington asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Washington">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this rule will allow the House to consider a conference report that provides for the conservation and development of water and related resources and authorizes the construction of various projects in order to improve rivers and harbors in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's water resource infrastructure is critical to our economy, transportation system, power generation, flood control, and environmental protection and restoration. This is especially true in the Pacific Northwest. Our region's river system is a great resource, one that must be well managed and protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hydroelectric dams provide clean, low-cost, renewable power. These facilities also provide a system of locks that allow for the efficient transport of tons of agricultural products to coastal ports, which reduces congestion on our highways and our rail systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The coastal ports that receive the river-barged goods and products are the gateways to overseas markets and also need very careful attention. The success of farmers and manufacturers throughout the Northwest depend upon these ports being navigable and appropriately maintained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are several provisions of this conference report that are important to the communities and individuals that I represent in central Washington that I would like to highlight. Like the WRDA bill that passed the House in the last Congress and the one that passed in April of this year, I am particularly pleased that the conference report includes a provision to permit the Corps of Engineers employees working at the dams in the Pacific Northwest to participate in wage surveys that  are conducted to determine their rate of pay. This important provision will allow these employees the same participation allowed to similar employees at dams in the region operated by the Bonneville Power Administration and the Bureau of Reclamation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This conference report also includes language that will allow the Corps to specifically give credit to the Port of Sunnyside in my district for funding it has invested to maintain progress on its wetland restoration and wastewater treatment project. This project is a creative initiative by the Port of Sunnyside to improve the river habitat and provide for greater economic growth in the local community. This provision ensures that the Port of Sunnyside gets proper credit for the funds it invests  as it works with the Corps to make this project a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this legislation lifts Corps restrictions on the development of several Port of Pasco properties. I am very hopeful that the elimination of these flowage easements will allow beneficial uses of this prime riverfront property to move forward for the betterment of the city of Pasco and the Tri-Cities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, Mr. Speaker, I am troubled by a change in a law inserted into this final bill that expressly authorizes the Secretary of the Army to approve removal of small dams under the Corps of Engineers Section 206 program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House is expected to consider a Democrat energy bill at some point this week, and I believe it doesn't bode well that we start off with making the removal of dams easier in this country. Dams provide power, drinking water, irrigation, transportation, and flood control. We need to value these benefits and recognize that hydropower dams are a clean and renewable energy resource.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this conference report provides regular review and updating of congressional direction to the Corps of Engineers and ensures that existing projects are maintained and that new needs are met.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas, who is our subcommittee Chair of the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the Rules Committee leader, Congresswoman Matsui, for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to support the rule for the conference report for <bill type="h" number="1495">H.R. 1495</bill>, the Water Resources Development Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill authorizes water resources projects and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers policy and programmatic changes that our Congress has failed to consider for far too long. Water resources legislation is most effective when it is considered every 2 years. I support this 2-year cycle as it provides stability to the program and assurance to the non-Federal sponsors who support Corps projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, no Water Resources bill has been enacted since year 2000, the entire term of the current administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The authorizations in the language are time sensitive, and there should be no surprise that this bill contains a substantial number of provisions. Many of these authorizations have been waiting for action more than 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on the rule, as well as the underlying conference report, so that we may, once and for all, advance this vitally important legislation for the American people.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Washington">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina, a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Mr. Brown.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="BROWN" of="South Carolina">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule and this critical legislation. While today is, unfortunately, a day several years overdue, it should not diminish the importance of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I came to Congress in 2001, I was excited to be a part of the Water Resources Subcommittee as we began to work on the next Water Resources Development Act. Water is critical to my district, not just because of the projects it authorizes but also because of the important guidance it gives the Army Corps of Engineers. The reforms contained in this bill, which are the results of that process started in 2001, represents meaningful change that will ensure that our limited dollars are spent wisely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Improving infrastructure is not a partisan issue. It is a commitment we as a Nation must ensure is met. If we do not, then we as a Nation will be facing significantly greater environmental and economic challenges than we do currently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot think of a group of individuals more committed to improving our Nation's infrastructure than my colleagues on the Transportation Committee. Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica have shown true leadership in guiding this legislation forward, especially as we worked to merge our bill with the one passed by the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Baker have stepped up to their new positions this year with true energy and passion about the issue before our subcommittee. And a special word of thanks must go to my friends, Don Young, Jerry Costello and Jimmy Duncan, who led the fight for this bill the past few Congresses. So much of this bill is because of their work and leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to close by urging all of my colleagues to support this rule and this critical legislation so we can get the Corps to work. To those who complain about the cost of this legislature, let me remind you that this one bill is doing the work of three WRDA bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you missed a payment on your house, would the bank allow you to pay only the next month's payment, forgetting the payment you missed? Would the bank allow you to do the same thing if you missed two monthly payments? Of course not. You would have to make your catch-up payment, plus make the payments for the current month. That is what this legislation represents, a catch-up of two bills that went uncompleted, while also addressing our current needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the good of our Nation's economy and environment, I urge my colleagues to support this overdue catch-up and pass this rule and the WRDA Conference report.</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="MATSUI" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="BLUMENAUER" of="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this measure, because I strongly support the rule and look forward to the enactment of the Conference Committee Report. It represents hard work and has been acknowledged by my former colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, whom I miss a great deal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many Members, I have some projects in here that I, too, am pleased to see move forward, particularly some environmental restoration in the State of Oregon that is going to smooth fish passages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must say that, in terms of the thing that excites me most about the bill, though, is the movement towards the reform of our Water Resources policies. I have long talked about this on the floor. I have attempted, as a member of the committee, to support them and continue to move this work forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I look at the bill in its totality, there were some good things from the Senate, and some good things in the House version. I think the conferees worked to enhance the overall reform aspects of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly pleased that we've been able to retain the update of the principles and guidelines which have not been changed since 1983. I think this is absolutely essential and look forward to the progress that the Corps can make in this area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the fact that the conferees worked to strengthen and refine language on independence review for large projects. Much of the time, at least some of the controversy that we have faced in the political arena would have been avoided if we would have had this independent review mechanism in place. But I think there is a lesson that we all must pay attention to, that once we have the independent review, it's very important that we listen to what the independent review concludes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One project that I'm less than totally enthusiastic about, the Upper Mississippi Lock and Dam Project, had independent reviews from the GAO, from the National Academy of Sciences, from the Army's Inspector General that all were negative but somehow the project continues to move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that we are sensitive to this. I take modest exception to my good friend from Washington being concerned about the language here to make it easier for dam removal. We have 60,000 dams that relate to the Depression era, for instance. We found last year that there are a number of dams in the Northeast; we don't know who is responsible for their maintenance. It is important in many cases to be able to sensitively, environmentally decommission dams in order to protect the public safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As it relates to the Everglades, bear in mind we are spending billions of dollars undoing an earlier Corps of Engineers project. As it relates to the areas around New Orleans in Louisiana, there was a three-quarters of a billion dollar navigation project in an area where river traffic was static or declining at the very point of the levee failure. That money could have been better spent protecting New Orleans. In fact, the LSU Hurricane Research Center thinks that that navigation project actually  may have amplified the surge and put more people at risk. At a time when we are dealing with global warming and climate change, the stakes are higher than ever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill represents an important step forward. I hope that we're able to work with the committee in its implementation and its oversight so we can build on this foundation and be better off as we move forward.</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Washington">
    <paragraph>Will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="BLUMENAUER" of="">
    <paragraph>I would be happy to yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Washington">
    <paragraph>As the gentleman knows, because we're both from the Northwest, we have large dams that I alluded to in my remarks that provide hydroelectric power for all of the Northwest. And I know the provision in this bill does not apply to those dams. But, nevertheless, I think we in the Northwest need to be cognizant of the fact that, once you start these things, sometime in the future it may go up.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <chair> The time of the gentleman has expired.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="BLUMENAUER" of="">
    <paragraph>I will continue to yield. I would like 20 seconds at the end though, Doc.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Washington">
    <paragraph>A point that I am simply making is that that is a major part, those dams on the Snake River and the Columbia River are major power sources for all of our electrical power and, therefore, for our economy. And I am just simply concerned because sometimes we don't look longer term enough. But if we look longer term enough and we start putting provisions in where it is a regular thing of takeout dams, then perhaps in the future, I hope not, I will do everything I can,  but perhaps in the future that all of a sudden somebody will take a shot at those larger dams. I think that would be detrimental to our economy in the Northwest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back to my friend.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="BLUMENAUER" of="">
    <paragraph>Thank you. I appreciate the gentleman from Washington's clarification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My point was that this is important because there comes a time when many dams outlive their usefulness. They either have to be restored or removed. They can actually pose a danger to the public. I don't want us to be frozen in place, unable to respond in the best way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There may come a time when people want to reassess big dams, small dams. What is in this committee report, however, is something I think is long overdue, to give the Corps flexibility in areas where there is little or no controversy; and I think it's important, that we need to be focusing more attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will continue to work with the gentleman to make sure that we do the right thing in the Northwest and make sure that we don't have any unintended consequences, and I will work with him to make sure that this is not an unintended consequence.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Washington">
    <paragraph>I yield myself 30 seconds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentleman's remarks, and I appreciate the gentleman simply saying that this is intended to go after dams that probably need to be looked at for a variety of reasons. And, in that sense, I obviously don't have a problem. My problem is long term, as I suggested, but I appreciate the gentleman working with me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with that, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee, a member of the T&amp;I Committee, Mr. Duncan.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="DUNCAN" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Water Resources Development Act, one of the most important bills we will take up in this Congress and I think certainly one of the most important environmental bills; and I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings) for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill contains flood control projects, environmental restoration projects, wastewater system improvements, water projects all over the country in rural areas, small towns, medium-size cities and large cities. And in many of these areas, our water systems are 50 or 75 or even 100 years old and are in desperate need for work and improvement and, many times, new construction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the privilege, as my friend from South Carolina (Mr. Brown) mentioned, of serving as chairman of the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee for 6 years; and during that time, as the gentlelady from California (Ms. Matsui) mentioned, we passed the WRDA bill twice, once with only 8 votes against it, once with only 14 votes against it. Unfortunately, the bill did not pass in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this Congress, under the leadership of my good friend, Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, and my friend, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Baker), and certainly under the leadership of our full committee chairman, our outstanding chairman, Mr. Oberstar, the gentleman from Minnesota, and the Ranking Member Mica from Florida, this bill passed not only the House, but it passed the Senate by a vote of 91-4. So there is tremendous support, bipartisan support,  for this legislation from people all over the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, if an automobile needs an oil change and you don't get it, a very low-cost matter, an engine can later explode and cost thousands of dollars; and that's sort of the situation we're in with many of our water systems from around the country. As several people have noted, this is a 7-year bill, and it deals with these water needs that have built up over all of that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it's a very fiscally conservative bill. As expensive as it is in one way, it's only a little over a month and a half of what we're spending in Iraq. And comparing these 7 years of built-up needs to what we're doing in the little over 1 1/2  and a half months in Iraq, I think makes this a very conservative bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the privilege of chairing the Aviation Subcommittee for 6 years before I chaired the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee for 6 years, and in both of those areas I saw that there were very strong, competing interests in those areas. But, in this bill, we brought all these competing interests together. There was a great deal of compromise that went on and a great deal of work was put into this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm very proud to support this bill. I think it's good for this Nation. I know it's good for my home area of east Tennessee, where we have so many water needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I just want to commend everybody who has worked so hard on this legislation. It's very important for this country. There is nothing that the people in this country take for granted like we do our clean water and wastewater systems, and we desperately need this work to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this is a bipartisan legislation that all of our colleagues can and should support.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers).</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="EHLERS" of="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I'm very pleased to speak on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Actually, this is a happy day for this Chamber that we are discussing this bill after 7 years of work, very hard work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the midst of all of the difficulties we've had in the past few days, the arguments, the debates, the disagreements, to take a brief pause and pass a bill or a conference report that we almost all will agree on is a good piece of work for our Nation. It's a good piece of work for the people of this Nation. It will help in innumerable areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I am especially pleased that we have addressed some of the problems in the Great Lakes which have been too neglected in the past. We have taken good care of the Everglades, the Chesapeake and Louisiana areas, lots of other water-filled areas, but not the Great Lakes, where 40 million people depend on the lakes for their drinking water, for their industry and so forth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I also want to commend Mr. Oberstar, who grabbed hold of this as soon as he became chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and made a total and complete commitment to getting this bill out. He deserves credit for having done so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to publicly express my appreciation to him and, of course, to Mr. Mica, who is the ranking member on the committee and worked equally hard on this. Richard Baker of our committee also put in many, many hours putting this bill together. So thank you to one and all.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in light of the discussion, the exchange that took place between the gentleman from Washington and the gentleman from Oregon, I just want to observe that the committee will hold hearings on the issue of dams. Tomorrow, in full committee, we will take up a bill to give the Corps new authorities and direction to conduct inspections of dam safety. But on the broader issue of dams that has been in our work portfolio for quite some time, we will have hearings and explore the broad issue  in terms of what the gentleman raised and in terms of what the gentleman from Oregon raised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is not something that will be taken lightly or swept under the rug in any way or forgotten when this bill was passed.</paragraph>

  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Washington">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that. Again, I am particularly sensitive, because of the nature of the dams that we are talking about on the Snake River and on the Columbia River in my State. But there's also larger dams throughout the Pacific Northwest. My understanding of this legislation, it was talking about dams, as the gentleman from Oregon described. I understand that. So I appreciate the chairman's consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="OBERSTAR" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Corps has long had authority to terminate dams, but it has been reluctant to use it. In the conference report, we make that authority explicit with the intention that the Corps will be invigorated to evaluate dams in a broader context.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think it is important for us to hold hearings so that the issues are aired fairly, equitably, scientifically, and engineeringwise, so rather than just have these things go on and conducted by bloggers and in some other unscientific way, let's put the issues on the record, and we will consult with the gentleman and the gentleman from Oregon on appropriate subjects and witnesses as we go through and proceed toward these hearings.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Washington">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield further, I appreciate that. I think it is something we need to look at. We have oversight nevertheless, anyway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the gentlewoman is prepared to close, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="MATSUI" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as was said, this bill is long overdue. Our country needs a comprehensive water resources policy, and WRDA is the framework that can meet this need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have 7 years of backlogged water projects that must be addressed. There is a growing demand on our already overburdened water infrastructure. The sooner we move forward on this conference report, the sooner our communities across the country will be healthier and safer. This conference report has bipartisan support. In fact, every member of the conference signed off on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge a "yes" vote on the previous question and on the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The previous question was ordered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution was agreed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</paragraph>
