    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to share with you and to share with all of our colleagues some truly wonderful news about a good friend and his health, a friend who is a former Member of this body, and the senior Senator from the State of South Dakota. This announcement is news of our friend, TIM JOHNSON.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, Senator Johnson was welcomed home by his constituents for the first time since suffering a debilitating brain hemorrhage last December. It was a joyous day, full of smiles, laughter and tears. And after 9 months of hard work, determination, and strength of mind and spirit, all qualities that have marked his tenure in public service, tomorrow TIM JOHNSON will return to the Senate Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In Senator Johnson's recovery, the prayers of South Dakota families, the prayers of all of us, and indeed the prayers of countless people across the country have been answered. And TIM, his loving wife Barbara, and their beautiful family will continue to move forward as resilient and remarkable as ever.</paragraph>
