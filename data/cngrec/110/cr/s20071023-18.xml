  <narrative>NATIONAL PHYSICAL THERAPY MONTH -- (Senate - October 23, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13257">S13257</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300058" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National Physical Therapy Month. What we currently celebrate as National Physical Therapy Month began in 1981 as a week long celebration in the month of June. In 1992, that week was extended to a whole month and was moved to October.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National Physical Therapy Month focuses attention on the value of physical therapy to one's health and the contributions of physical therapists to the health of their communities. This year National Physical Therapy Month is focusing on obesity because physical activity is a crucial component of weight loss and better health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My understanding of physical therapy has greatly increased over the past several months. I owe a debt of gratitude to a great many doctors, nurses, and therapists who brought me through the darkest moments of my life and who are walking with me on the road to recovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am blessed to work with professional and talented physical therapists as I continue my recovery. Their confidence in my ability to improve is infectious, and my physical therapists motivate me to work harder than I thought possible. I am confident that with my hard work and the dedication of my physical therapists, my potential to improve is limitless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout my career in the U.S. House and Senate, I have strongly supported expanding access to all kinds of health care professionals. Physical therapists provide critical services to their patients. In a rural State like ours, where they may be the only provider of these services in their community, physical therapists greatly improve patient access to care and quality of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year the Senate is considering the Medicare Access to Rehabilitation Services Act which would repeal the annual Medicare outpatient cap on certain physical and occupational therapy services and the Medicare Patient Access to Physical Therapists Act which would authorize qualified physical therapists to provide services for Medicare beneficiaries without requiring a physician referral. It would also provide for treatment of outpatient speech-language pathology services separately from outpatient  physical therapy services. I am pleased to support both of these measures, and I commend them to my colleagues for their consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage everyone to consider with their health care professionals how physical therapy might benefit them, whether recovering from an accident or illness or seeking preventive care. National Physical Therapy Month is a great time to learn more about the benefits of physical therapy.</paragraph>
