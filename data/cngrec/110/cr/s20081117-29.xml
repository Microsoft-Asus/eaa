    <paragraph>Madam President, I am pleased to recognize the career and contributions of University of California, Davis, Chancellor Larry Vanderhoef for his 25 years of service to the university.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chancellor Vanderhoef was born in a small Wisconsin town and was the first person in his family to graduate from high school. After high school, he attended the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, where he earned a B.S. and M.S. in biology and later earned a Ph.D. in plant biochemistry at Purdue University. Chancellor Vanderhoef began his career in education at the University of Illinois in 1970 as a faculty member and was appointed provost at the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1980.  He spent the next 4 years at the University of Maryland before heading west to California and the University of California, Davis, in 1984.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chancellor Vanderhoef began his career at U.C. Davis serving as executive vice chancellor and later as provost/executive vice chancellor. In April 1994, Larry Vanderhoef was named the fifth chancellor of the University of California, Davis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under Chancellor Vanderhoef's leadership, U.C. Davis experienced a period of dramatic growth, adding 4 million square feet of office, classroom, lab, and clinical space to support its 8,000 additional students and 44 percent more faculty. He revitalized the south end of campus with the additions of the Robert and Margrit Mondavi Performing Arts Center, the Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science, and the Graduate School of Management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During Chancellor Vanderhoef's tenure at Davis, the university was invited to join the Association of American Universities, recognizing Davis's standing as a top research university. The campus has also been recognized by U.S. News and World Report as the 11th best public university and Washington Monthly recognized it as the 8th best university for their contributions to society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over his career, Chancellor Vanderhoef has been honored for his dedicated leadership at U.C. Davis and in the community. In 2003, the Arts and Business Council of Sacramento honored him with its Prelude to the Season Outstanding Contribution Award; in 2004, he was honored as Sacramentan of the Year by the Sacramento Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce; and in 2006 he was given the Northern California International Leadership Award from the Northern California World Trade Center and California Business,  Transportation and Housing Agency for his efforts to increase the campus's international engagement. He was also named one of the 20 people who have contributed most substantially to California's Capital Region over the past 20 years by The Sacramento Business Journal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the University of California and Davis community gather to celebrate the retirement of Chancellor Larry Vanderhoef, I would like to congratulate him and thank him for his service to California.</paragraph>
