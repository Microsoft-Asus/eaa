    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor to urge my colleagues to override the President's veto of this important bill. There are many colleagues who want to speak tonight on the subject of WRDA, because this has been a team effort. Senator Boxer, the chairman of the committee, along with Senator Inhofe, ranking member, have worked hard and diligently to put a bill together which the vast majority of us support, and many colleagues are here tonight to speak. I will be  very brief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to speak about this bill because it is so critical to Louisiana. It is critical for us to give a green light to the people of south Louisiana and to the gulf coast who are still struggling to rebuild and put the pieces of their shattered lives back together because of the unprecedented two-punch storm--Katrina and Rita--and the breaking of the Federal levee system that should have held but didn't. We saw 285,000 homes destroyed. Because of the fires in California, as horrific as they were,  screaming out of the mountains with the Santa Ana winds and scorching homes and neighborhoods, 1,600 homes were lost. Thousands of families were displaced and some businesses destroyed. But compared to Katrina and Rita, which is now 2 years in the past but is very close in the memory and hearts of the people still living there, we have to continue to remind ourselves and the Nation, it was 285,000 homes destroyed, unprecedented in the history of this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill in place lays a foundation for us to build on. It lays a foundation for security and prosperity. Frankly, without it, our long-term recovery is in jeopardy. This bill will authorize, not fund, about $7 billion in critical water infrastructure projects, the first real piece of Louisiana coastal restoration effort, the closing of a shipping channel that was literally devastating to the parish in which it lies, St. Bernard Parish. Every home was destroyed in that parish; 67,000 people  who lived there saw their lives and businesses destroyed when the levees supporting this commercial channel failed. There were levees throughout the metropolitan area that failed. This bill begins to lay a foundation for coastal restoration, to restore levees, to close the Mississippi Gulf outlet channel we refer to as Mr. Go, establishing for the first time hurricane protection along some southern parishes, Lafourche and Terrebonne, which</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why Senator Inhofe and Senator Boxer and the members of their committee--Senator Vitter represents us on this authorizing committee--have done an outstanding job in pulling together these projects. I don't know why the President chose this bill to try to reassume the mantle of fiscal responsibility, but he picked the wrong bill. As my colleagues will explain, it is fiscally responsible to pass a framework, a guideline, a limit on these projects. That is what  WRDA does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the Nation it is important we invest in critical infrastructure. I don't like to make these comparisons on everything, but it is worth noting that we are now spending $120 billion this year in Iraq. We are spending $2.3 billion a week. It is hard for me to go home to Louisiana and explain why we can't come up with $7 billion in authorizations for projects that are going to last over the next 20 or 30 years. We still have to go back and get the funding, but without authorization, we can't  get started.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues will join me in a strong override. The House did so last night. I look forward to the Senate overriding the President's veto of this important bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I retain the remainder of my time.</paragraph>
