  <speaking speaker="400351" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Democrat budget raises taxes, plain and simple. You can cite all of these other groups that say one thing or another, but the group that counts is the Congressional Budget Office. That is the official scorekeeping agency that measures our budgets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And according to the Congressional Budget Office, the Democrat budget provides for the largest tax increase in American history. Either that, or they don't balance the budget. They can't have it both ways. They are saying they balance the budget, and the only way they balance the budget is by raising taxes, cutting the child tax credit in half, bringing back the marriage tax penalty, bringing back the death tax, raising tax rates across the board on all income tax payers, repealing the 10 percent  for low-income Americans, bringing back higher tax rates on capital gains and dividends which create jobs and help seniors save.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, if their tax plan comes to fruition, if they actually accomplish what they are seeking to accomplish, they will tax the small businesses of America at higher tax rates than the largest corporations in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, these tax cuts created jobs. They created 7.6 million jobs. Don't raise taxes.</paragraph>
