    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have always supported organized labor, for a simple reason: When workers join together and act collectively, they can achieve economic gains that they would never be able to negotiate individually. History tells us this: Union members were on the front lines fighting for the 40-hour workweek, the minimum wage, employer-provided health insurance and pensions. Organized labor led the way in passing legislation to ensure fair and safe workplaces and in championing many  other employee safety nets, including Social Security, Medicare, and the Family and Medical Leave Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, continued forward progress is not inevitable. We have seen this in recent years, as union membership has declined, wages have stagnated, the numbers of uninsured have risen, and private companies have been allowed to default on their pensions, threatening the retirement security of millions of Americans. It is clear to me that to rebuild economic security, we must first rebuild strong and vibrant unions. And to rebuild strong unions, we must first reduce unfair barriers to union  organizing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To rebuild the promise of health care and pension benefits, we must reduce unfair barriers to union organizing. A recent study by the Institute for America's Future confirms this. By comparing organizing campaigns in the United States and Canada, the study found that more worker-friendly certification rules increase union participation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, this is all just common sense. If you reduce the barriers to workers joining unions, more workers will join. But what does it mean? Well, as this study makes clear, by passing the Employee Free Choice Act, and by making it easier for workers to band together, more than 3.5 million Americans would be able to secure health coverage, and nearly 3 million more Americans would have access to employer-based pensions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Middle class families in this country have an increasingly difficult time making ends meet. More than 47 million Americans lack health insurance--including 251,000 Iowans--and even those with coverage find that if often covers less and less. This should not be happening in America. When productivity rises, everyone should see their fair share of that gain, but in the past several years, increasing productivity has gone hand-in-hand with a growing wage gap. According to the nonpartisan Congressional  Research Service:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adjusted for inflation, average worker pay rose 8 percent from 1995 to 2005; median CEO pay at the 350 largest firms rose about 150 percent over the same period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of Iowa, real median household income fell by 3.4 percent between 1999 and 2005, dropping from $48,142 in 1999 to $46,500 in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By passing the Employee Free Choice Act, by giving workers a seat at the table, we can start to reverse this negative trend. Union participation in the workplace means everybody wins. When employees have a voice--not just to ask for better wages and benefits, but to make suggestions about how to do things better--employers benefit, too. Union employees take pride in their work and work to get more training. And they are happy to help find other efficiencies in the operation, because they get  a share of the savings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, scaremongers are trying to tell us that the Employee Free Choice Act takes away employee rights to a "secret ballot." Nothing could be further from the truth. This bill does not establish a new election process; it merely requires employers to honor employee choice. Right now, the company gets to decide whether it will recognize a majority sign-up vote. Under the aptly named Employee Free Choice Act, the employees get to decide. If the workers want to use the National Labor Relations  Board process, they are perfectly free to do so. But, as we know from hard experience, that process can be threatening and intimidating to many employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to making it easier to form a union in the first place, the Employee Free Choice Act provides for arbitration for the first contract. I know from personal experience how simply stalling negotiations of a contract can bust a union and cause major economic hardship for people. My brother Frank was a proud UAW member for 23 years. He worked at the old Delavan manufacturing plant in Des Moines. In 23 years, he missed only 5 days of work--all of them because of blizzards. He made a good  living. He was a dedicated employee. During those 23 years, there was never one strike or work stoppage. Delavan made good money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But then Old Man Delavan decided to retire and sell the company. A group of investors bought it. And one of the new owners bragged that, "If you want to see how to get rid of a union, come to Delavan, and we'll show you how."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He made good on that boast. When the contract came up, the company put forward conditions that no union could agree to in good conscience. The owners refused to budge, and the UAW local had no choice but to go out on strike for the first time. When they did, the company brought in replacement workers. It was a long, bitter  strike. And after 1 year as allowed by labor law--they had a decertification vote. Who votes to decertify the union? The workers  who are there--the replacement workers. They didn't want to lose their jobs, so they voted to decertify.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So after 23 years Frank was out of a job. He lost his union job with excellent pay, vacation time, and a pension. And what does a 54-year-old deaf man do in a predicament like that? He got a job as a janitor at a shopping mall--working nights for minimum wage, with no benefits and no vacation time. It didn't just destroy his livelihood. It broke his spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friends, that is what happens when unions are weakened and destroyed. It jeopardizes our standard of living and our whole middle-class way of life. And, my friends, that is exactly what is happening, today, to tens of millions of people all across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I quote a December, 2005 letter signed by 11 Nobel Peace Prize laureates calling for greater international labor rights:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even the wealthiest nation in the world--the United States of America--fails to adequately protect workers' rights to form unions and bargain collectively. Millions of U.S. workers lack any legal protection to form unions and thousands are discriminated against every year for trying to exercise these rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to level the playing field for workers in this country. It is time to give them a truly free and fair election process to decide if they want representation in the workplace. It's time to pass the Employee Free Choice Act.</paragraph>
