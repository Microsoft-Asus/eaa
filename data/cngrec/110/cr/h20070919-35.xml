    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tomorrow in Jena, Louisiana will be the culmination of the frustration and the outrage felt by so many  across America as relates to the Jena 6.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Jena 6 is not about a few boys misbehaving, because we understand that when young people need correcting, we do so, but it is about the systemic discrimination, if you will, of African American males and Hispanic males as relates to the juvenile justice system. This young man should have been tried in the juvenile justice system, but he was tried in a system that gave him a sentence that was clearly, clearly without merit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tomorrow we go to ask for justice not just for this young man and the other five that are there, but for young men across America who have been discriminated against, not given a second chance, and using the justice system to punish on the basis of race or ethnic background.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Enough is enough. Where is the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division? Obviously, the lights are out. They need to turn their lights on.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
