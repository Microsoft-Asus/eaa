    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize May 8, 2007 as National Teacher Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Teachers play a vital role in our society. They are a driving force in the course this great Nation takes. The molding of young minds is a daunting task. Yet teachers willingly accept the challenge with open arms. Being a former math teacher, I know the great challenges teachers face every day. Teachers often have thankless jobs, getting little appreciation for the myriad of tasks they do on a daily basis. They tie shoes, wipe noses, dab tears, and provide comfort all without asking for anything  in return. Teachers are disciplinarians, educators, and friends. Their job is truly invaluable and priceless. Teachers give each student a toolbox full of essential tools to use, training them for many of life's situations that might come their way. These tools give students the confidence to face each day prepared for living.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Historian Henry Adams said, "A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops." I couldn't agree more. Educators all over the country teach and train America's next generation. Students are given direction and guidance for their futures from their teachers. Teachers can be very influential in the lives of their students, and thus influence generations of people to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me take this opportunity to recognize Ms. Tamara Tiong for her recent nomination for the National Teacher of the Year Award. Ms. Tiong is a special education teacher at Dulce Elementary School in Dulce, NM, and has taught for 8 years. She is a shining example of what all teachers strive to be: challenging, encouraging, and compassionate. I thank Ms. Tiong today for her great service and wish her many more years of teaching and training America's youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Join me today in saying thank you to our teachers for all they do. They deserve our thanks and support. Thank you, teachers, for every life you have touched and every life you will touch in the future.</paragraph>
