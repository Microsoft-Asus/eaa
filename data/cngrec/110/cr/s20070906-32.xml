  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="TRIBUTE TO SUN YET WONG">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the National Reconnaissance Office, NRO, is honoring two individuals, Dr. Paul G. Kaminski and Mr. Sun Yet Wong, who have made significant contributions to the discipline of national reconnaissance. They will be inducted as members of Pioneer Hall. This prestigious award bestowed to 71 people is the NRO's highest honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of these two individuals, I am honored to know Mr. Wong and I wish to congratulate him on being selected by the NRO for the 2007 Class of Pioneers. The work of technological revolutionaries, such as Mr. Sun Yet Wong, has made significant and lasting contributions to the discipline of national reconnaissance, and has set the stage for future advancements in the field. His efforts have helped advance technology by contributing to the effectiveness of  NRO  satellite systems. Today, the NRO continues to build on his revolutionizing successes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Wong's career in national reconnaissance began in 1955 and continues to the present day. Although he is being honored with this award because of his outstanding work and contributions to the effectiveness of NRO satellite systems, Mr. Wong has been a major contributor to a number of technological advancements. Among his achievements, Mr. Wong was the key designer of support equipment for ground-test deployment of satellite solar panels whose application overcame a structural on-orbit deployment  anomaly. He also introduced the use of a synthetic lubricant to stabilize and extend the life of control movement gyroscopes used on NRO satellites. He currently works as a consultant for TriSept Corporation and Boeing Space Systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Wong is a true pioneer who continues to revolutionize technology. Again, I commend him for all that he has done and wish him the very best in future endeavors.</paragraph>
