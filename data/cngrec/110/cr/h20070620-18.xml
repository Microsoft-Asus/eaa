    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, some things are more important than politics. Lifesaving research that has the potential to cure diseases and end suffering for millions of Americans ought to be one of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But for President Bush, certain things aren't above politics. The President formed his opinion on stem cell research and now he has America ensnarled in his political straitjacket.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people see stem cell research as a cure to illnesses that plague their family and family members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today, as the President vetoes legislation that is backed by 72 percent of the American people, he will attempt to fool the American public and soothe his conscience with a symbolic gesture that is empty of medical value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people will not be fooled. They know that the President has failed to lead and, instead, made a decision that is a crushing blow to millions of Americans suffering from diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and ALS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sixty years ago, when America was plagued with polio, this Nation and its political leaders rose to the challenge and took on the medical challenge of their time. Thank goodness we are not facing that challenge now, and we had leaders then who put medical science ahead of political stance.</paragraph>
