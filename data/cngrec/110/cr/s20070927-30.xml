  <narrative>IN RECOGNITION OF PAUL WICE -- (Senate - September 27, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12283">S12283</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300077" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to congratulate a radio legend in my home State of Nebraska. Paul Wice, who has been a talk show host, news reporter, and news director at KGFW Radio in Kearney, NE, for nearly 40 years, is retiring and will broadcast his final show on September 28, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul got his start in radio working part time, while earning a bachelor's degree in 1966 in speech and music from what was then known as Kearney State College. His first full-time radio job was at KWBE in Beatrice, NE, where he served as news director.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1967 Paul returned to Kearney as the afternoon announcer and news director at KGFW. Deciding to try something other than radio, he left the station just a year later to join the Kearney Hub newspaper. He quickly found that his heart was in radio and returned to KGFW as its news director in 1969. Paul has been there ever since and is now in his 38th consecutive year of broadcasting on KGFW to the people of central Nebraska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While working full time, Paul went on to earn a master's degree in speech communication in 1988 and has served as an adjunct instructor at the University of Nebraska-Kearney since then. He is responsible for KGFW receiving the coveted Mark Twain Award from the Nebraska Associated Press five times, including three consecutive years from 1997 to 1999.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A past president of Nebraska Associated Press Broadcasters, Paul was also the first recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Nebraska AP. He currently serves on the Freedom of Information Committee of the Nebraska Broadcasters Association. He has covered it all for KGFW, including riding on the Robert F. Kennedy train in 1968, just months before the Presidential contender was assassinated. On the other end of the political spectrum, Paul attended a White House Radio-Television News  Directors Association luncheon with then-President Ronald Reagan. He also served as the Nebraska Broadcasters Association's official witness to the first execution in Nebraska in decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul made his mark serving the people of Kearney and central Nebraska, not only as a successful broadcaster but as a dependable source of news year after year. It is highly unusual in this day and age for someone to be able to say they have worked for the same employer for nearly four decades, especially in the highly competitive field of broadcasting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At every turn in my own political career, from my days as State insurance director to my terms as Governor to my present role as a U.S. Senator, Paul has been there to cover the news, and I will miss interviewing with him in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Wice has definitely been "The Talk of the Town," as his radio program is called. His absence from the airways will leave a void that will be tough to fill, but I am sure I join all Nebraskans in wishing him well in retirement as he signs off the air for the very last time.</paragraph>
