    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago this week, Congress formally declared that genocide was taking place in Darfur, and Congressman DON PAYNE is owed a debt of gratitude for leading this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While much has been done since then to push pressure on Khartoum, the genocide still rages. Our young people and the faith community have tirelessly reminded us of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was in Darfur earlier this year for the third time, and let me tell you, it is getting worse. We passed a number of bills in Congress imposing sanctions urging our allies like China and the League of Arab States to get involved, but we must do more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, with the help of our good friend and great leader, Chairman BARNEY FRANK, the Financial Services Committee Chair, we will take another step toward marking up my bill, <bill type="h" number="180">H.R. 180</bill>, the Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act, which authorizes States to divest from Sudan and bans new Federal contracts with companies doing business with the genocidal regime in Khartoum. We must keep the pressure on President Bashir and insist on unfettered access for the United Nations and African Union,  and we must save Darfur.</paragraph>
