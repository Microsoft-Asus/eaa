  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, we are going to have morning business for an hour after Senator McConnell and I finish our brief remarks to the Senate. The time will be equally divided and controlled. Following the period of morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the Department of Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under an order previously entered, people have until 2:30 p.m. today to file any first-degree amendments to the bill. We are going to finish this bill perhaps not tonight, but I hope we can finish it tomorrow because we are going to move then to the Labor-HHS legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tonight we are going to have a vote, and we are going to see if we can come up with an amendment to the appropriations bill we are working on. If not, there is still a judge we need to have approved, and we will do that tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope everyone understands we need to do the Labor-HHS bill. That would be the sixth bill we will have completed. We are going to start that bill as soon as we finish the bill that is before us, the Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill, and we are going to finish that bill this week. We have to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The farm bill is so important all across this country, and the markup of that bill is scheduled for next week. The reason we have to finish the Labor-HHS appropriations bill this week is the chairman of the committee the farm bill will come out of is Senator Harkin, who is also the chairman of the subcommittee that deals with Labor-HHS. So we have to finish that. I hope it does not spill into the weekend. We have talked about that several times this year and rarely have we had to do  it. But we need to get that done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After this week, we will only have four work weeks before we have our Thanksgiving Day recess. We are all on line to see what we can do to work out our differences with the White House to finish our funding for this year. We need to do that, and finishing this bill will point us in that direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. President.</paragraph>
