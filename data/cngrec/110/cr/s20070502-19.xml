    <paragraph>Madam President, today I wish to acknowledge a very special occasion. It has come to my attention that on May 9, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the CDC Foundation in Atlanta will be honoring Kent "Oz" C. Nelson, retired chair and CEO of UPS, for his unselfish and untiring work on behalf of CDC and public health around the globe. They will be dedicating CDC's main auditorium as the Kent "Oz" C. Nelson Auditorium. This is a great honor for a man who truly  deserves it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As elected officials, we naturally and rightfully expect to hear from interested constituents and from the leaders of our governmental institutions about programmatic and capital needs. It is much more unusual to hear about such needs from a CEO-level leader of a global corporation like UPS. But over the past 8 years, Oz and many other CEO's like him, including Bernie Marcus, Phil Jacobs and Christine Jacobs, have regularly written, called and visited Washington, DC to remind us of the importance  of upgrading CDC's Atlanta-based labs and facilities to ensure that the world's best scientists are equipped with world-class facilities to support their work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During a tour of CDC in the fall of 1999, Oz, Bernie and Phil were troubled by the condition of CDC labs and its negative impact on CDC's ability to recruit top scientists and to protect all Americans from a host of threats ranging from SARS, anthrax and pandemic flu to obesity and environmental toxins. Scientists were working in overcrowded World War II Quonset huts and cinder block labs with frayed wiring and poor ventilation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oz could have just written a letter. He could have written off CDC's problems as the government's problem. Instead, he helped organize a concerted effort to highlight the problem and encourage a solution. In the last 8 years, Congress has appropriated $1.2 billion of the $1.6 billion needed to complete CDC's master facilities plan. One needs only tour CDC's campus and visit with the scientists there to see the amazing results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As elected officials, we learn early to appreciate people like Oz Nelson. People who are never too busy to care, never to busy to identify and help solve problems. Since "retiring," and I use that term loosely in Oz's case, he has chaired the Annie Casey Foundation, served on the board of the Carter Center in Atlanta, served on the board of the United Way of America and chaired its national fundraising campaign, chaired the board of the CDC Foundation and been instrumental in starting and supporting  an Atlanta-based Museum of Patriotism that celebrates the American spirit. And these are just a few of his many nonprofit interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oz Nelson is, himself, a patriot who embodies the very best of the American spirit. And I know those of you who know and have worked with Oz join me today in congratulating him on the dedication of the new Kent "Oz" C. Nelson Auditorium at CDC.</paragraph>
