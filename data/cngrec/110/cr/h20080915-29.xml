  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400364" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we honor the life and musical legacy of Isaac Hayes, a passionate humanitarian, whose prolific songwriting and distinctive baritone were loved across generations and around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He overcame humble beginnings and personal obstacles to make excellent contributions in many endeavors. He was a true Renaissance man, an extraordinary singer, songwriter and music producer who also achieved success as a pianist, saxophone player, cookbook author, radio show host, and television and motion picture actor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Covington, Tennessee, tragically orphaned as an infant, and raised by his maternal grandparents, Isaac Hayes came to know the pleasures of country life but also the hardships of rural poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shortly after his family moved to Memphis for the greater opportunities in the "big city," his grandfather passed away. To help his family survive, Isaac Hayes worked in cotton fields, cut lawns, and cleaned bricks at two cents apiece, all while going to school. He even shined shoes on Memphis' famous Beale Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite experiencing rural, and then urban, poverty, he found ways to bring music into a central role in his life. At the age of five, he began singing in his local church and before long had also taught himself to play the piano, electronic organ, flute and saxophone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He dropped out of high school for a time, but never lost sight of the critical role that education plays in improving one's life. He returned to school and proudly graduated at the age of 21.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduating, he played piano for Floyd Newman, a saxophonist bandleader. This work led to his becoming a studio musician for a new label called Stax Records, where his first paid sessions were with Otis Redding. These sessions were so successful that he became a ubiquitous presence at Stax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While at Stax, he met David Porter, who became a long-standing friend and collaborator. As a result of their collaboration as songwriters and producers, they made more than 200 songs, including such classics as "B-A-B-Y," "Soul Man," and "Hold on, I'm Comin'."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps the musical accomplishment that Isaac Hayes is best known for is the groundbreaking score and theme song that he wrote for the movie "Shaft." His smooth baritone vocals and iconic style carried that song to the top of the charts, nationally and internationally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his life, he received an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, two Grammy Awards, the NAACP Image Award, and the Edison Award, which is Europe's highest musical honor. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was not content to rest on his musical laurels, probably because of his roots in both rural and urban poverty. A passionate humanitarian concerned about the underprivileged throughout the world, he saw education and literacy as the keys to freedom and prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Based on that belief, he founded the Isaac Hayes Foundation, whose mission  it is to promote literacy and education and other programs throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The foundation, among other endeavors, built an 8,000-square-foot education facility in Ghana, West Africa, and supported education efforts in Tennessee. In recognition of his humanitarian work and educational and economic contributions, in 1994 Isaac Hayes was crowned a king in Ghana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, Isaac Hayes and David Porter came to Capitol Hill to speak to Senators and House Members about the importance of protecting the intellectual property rights of their fellow songwriters and performing artists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was an excellent advocate for his fellow songwriters and vocal artists. He was humble, well-spoken, and passionate about protecting creative works, not just for the benefit of artists, but also for the benefit of our national economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is so much more that I could say about this man, but for time's sake, I'll just end with this observation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Isaac Hayes' achievements and influence made him a cultural icon, and his humanitarian work also made him a great human being. With the fatal stroke that took his life at the age of 65, Isaac Hayes leaves behind a legacy of monumental significance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleagues from Tennessee, Mrs. Blackburn and Mr. Cohen, for their leadership on this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's my great honor to introduce the author of this piece of legislation, someone who understands the importance of Isaac Hayes to Tennessee and to the music world, Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn. I yield her 5 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding, and I must first thank my colleague and cosponsor from Tennessee, Congressman Cohen. This resolution would not be possible without his hard work. Vital business in Tennessee has delayed his arrival on the floor today, and I know that if he were here with us that he would speak better than most about his constituent and his good friend Isaac Hayes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor for me to share the representation of Memphis, Tennessee, with Congressman Cohen. We are honored to represent its people and its proud traditions. Memphis has contributed so much to our State and indeed to our country, and perhaps the greatest contribution that there is is that "Memphis Sound." The Memphis Sound really is the soundtrack for America. It captures the rhythm of the region, as well as the hopes, the frustrations, and the aspirations of  so many Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do stand on the floor today to celebrate the life of the man who gave so much of that music its soul, Isaac Hayes. Isaac was one of the driving forces behind the legendary Stax Records that created and amplified the Memphis Sound. Collaborating with David Porter, Isaac wrote some of our most famous songs: "Soul Man," "Hold on, I'm Comin'," and his own hits like "Walk on By" and that groundbreaking musical score and the theme song from the movie "Shaft."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first came to know Isaac when I was at the Tennessee Film, Entertainment and Musician Commission, heading that body, working on issues that were so important to our songwriters. And I found that Isaac was fiercely proud of the Memphis sound that he had helped to give birth to and the different genres that had been spawned by that, and I know that all of Tennessee today is fiercely proud of Isaac and his work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Isaac was more than a great musician. He was also a noble humanitarian, as we have just heard from the gentleman from Virginia. I found the Isaac Hayes Foundation and their work to be something extraordinary. It was founded by Isaac Hayes, and it was done so to promote literacy and music education. He constructed an educational facility in Ghana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I last saw him and visited with him at a ceremony in Memphis this spring. He was being honored not only for his contributions to Memphis music but also his contributions and his humanitarian work for the City of Memphis. He grew up in Memphis. He graduated from Mannassas High School in 1962, and even after he achieved worldwide acclaim, he always remained loyal to the Memphis community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, I didn't know it then, but I am saddened now that that was going to be the last visit that we had. But I will tell you, Isaac Hayes and David Porter were still talking about intellectual property, protecting songwriters, and making certain that songwriters were paid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, Memphis has lost a champion and an inspiration, but they still have his music and his soul.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As co-chair for the Congressional Songwriters Caucus, I am honored to bring this resolution to the floor of the House today, and on behalf of Isaac's family, the songwriting community in Tennessee and for listeners worldwide who have been touched by the Isaac Hayes sound, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if I might inquire of the gentleman, does he have any additional speakers?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400364" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Then I would close briefly by supporting this bipartisan legislation, recognizing the life of Isaac Hayes. Additionally mentioning that Chairman Conyers and Ranking Member Smith support this and support recognizing this inspirational man, his inspirational life, and his fine music and work he did well into the last days of his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400364" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume just to thank our colleagues from Tennessee for working together on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
