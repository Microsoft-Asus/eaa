  <narrative>MICHIGAN TECH'S TUITION OFFER -- (Senate - January 24, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="277">S277</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Michigan Technological University's recent decision to offer in State tuition to the children or spouse of anyone on active military duty, regardless of their State of residence, deserves our recognition and praise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are all deeply indebted to our men and women in uniform for their bravery and sacrifice. Michigan Tech is expressing thanks and showing support for the families of those serving in our armed services in a way that will make a real difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While out-of-State students at Michigan Tech pay over $21,000 for tuition, in State tuition is less than $10,000 each year. This savings will be available to the families of the 1.3 million men and women who are on Active Duty in the Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marines, Navy, National Guard and Reserve, as well as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and United States Public Health Service Corps. We believe that Michigan Tech is the first college or university in the Nation to  extend in State tuition to the families of all military personnel serving on Active Duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The idea developed after an applicant to a State university in Michigan received an admission offer but was denied in State tuition even though he graduated from a Michigan high school. His father was serving on Active Duty and had been stationed in Michigan but was moved out-of-State,  prompting the tuition decision. Michigan Tech's new policy would allow this student, along with many others, to receive in State tuition if admitted. Hopefully this decision  will be followed by other colleges and universities as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The university's fight song, "Fight Tech, Fight!" includes the line: "From Northern hills we'll sound our cry, we'll ring your praises to the sky!" This is an important decision by Michigan Tech that deserves praise and, from the hills of Michigan's upper peninsula, it is a decision that will undoubtedly be heard and appreciated by military families across the country and our brave men and women stationed around the world.</paragraph>
