  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a staff member who is, unfortunately, leaving to go back to Louisiana. I want to spend a few minutes talking about his wonderful service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Herman Joseph Gesser came to work in Washington for 1 year. He is an attorney and a very able architect and thought he would come and work here for the Louisiana delegation to contribute to our State and to learn the ways of Washington in public service. Ten years later, he is still here. We are sad to see him return to Louisiana, but family responsibilities and duties call him home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has been projects director and general counsel of my office now for 9 years. He has served with diligence and dedication, honesty, integrity, and creativity. He is truly one of the most sought after and popular members of the Senate staff. He has worked on transportation projects. He has been an expert on Corps of Engineers projects, someone whom both Republican and Democratic staffers trust to give them just the facts, give it to them straight, and give it to them quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I laugh and say everybody in Louisiana needs a Bubba on their staff. I sure have had a very special Bubba on my staff for all these many years, as he is called and referred to kindly and in a very friendly way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bubba has served the people of his home parish, New Iberia Parish, with distinction. He has done some extraordinary work, as I said, in the area of transportation. He is going to be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He really is a true example of selfless service. He could be, Mr. President--as you know, many of our staff could make a great deal more money, particularly in his case with the double degrees he has as a lawyer and an architect. But yet for 10 years, he has chosen to serve and stay through the challenges of Katrina and Rita where his talents and abilities were called on literally daily and was one of the go-to people I counted on to give me facts, to give them to me quickly so I could advocate  more effectively on behalf of the 4.5 million people in Louisiana and the millions of people who live in the gulf coast area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to publicly recognize Herman Joseph Gesser, a citizen of Louisiana and a great servant to the people of our State in such a time of need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know his father is very proud of him. I know his mother, who just passed away last year, still continues to give him blessings from Heaven, and that his extended family and many friends are very grateful to him for the support he has given to us all these many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His homecoming in south Louisiana will be greeted with fanfare by his hometown, but it will be a great loss to the Landrieu staff in Washington, DC.</paragraph>
