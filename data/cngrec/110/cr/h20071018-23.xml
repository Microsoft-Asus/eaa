    <paragraph>I yield to my good friend, the gentleman from South Carolina, for the purpose of inquiring about next week's schedule.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400075" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for yielding to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on Monday the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning-hour business and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes rolled until 6:30 p.m. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A list of those bills will be announced by the close of business tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Tuesday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning-hour business and 10 a.m. for legislative business. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business. We expect to consider <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill>, the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Act; <bill type="h" number="1011">H.R. 1011</bill>, Virginia Ridge and Valley Act; <bill type="h" number="505">H.R. 505</bill>, Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act; <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>, Employment Nondiscrimination Act; and <bill type="h" number="3867">H.R. 3867</bill>, Small Business Contracting Act.

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for that information. There are really a couple of bills I wanted to ask about that I wonder when and if they are going to be coming back. As the gentleman knows, we only have a few more weeks of legislation outside of what we might have to do on the appropriations bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, I spoke on the floor, and others did, in opposition to the FISA bill, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act bill, that was on the floor yesterday. We quit in the middle of that debate. I am wondering if the gentleman has any information on when that bill may come back to the floor or if you have any information that it wouldn't be coming back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400075" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding. We do expect the bill to come back to the floor, and it is under discussion as to when that will be.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for that. I would say that we would be interested in trying to continue to work to get a bill on the floor on this important issue that a broad base of Members of the House on both sides could support. And as we were able to talk about earlier today, I would hope that we would have a chance maybe to look at that bill one more time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other bill that got a lot of attention this week was the bill that was reported out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Armenian genocide, and I wonder if my friend has any sense of the status of that bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400075" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman. We are still looking at that bill, and we expect next week to have some announcements about it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for that information. We are very interested in that bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the bill that we just voted on, a vote that would have been pretty easy to predict, I believe, 2 weeks ago, I noticed just this week that the Governor of New York said that he would be willing to accept new language in that bill that would eliminate his State's ability to cover families at over 400 percent of the poverty level. I would suggest that that is one of the compromises that would really be helpful, if we could eliminate that level that appears to only initially apply to the State  of New York. Last week, when Mr. Hoyer and I discussed this, he suggested that if the veto was sustained, that his view was that we should have an opportunity to work together on a bill that could come to the House floor. And I am wondering if the gentleman has any information on how the majority intends to move forward now on that bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400075" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman. I can tell the gentleman that we are serious about extending coverage to 10 million children. I think that the issue you just raised is an issue that has been talked about quite a bit, especially in the media, for the last 2 or 3 days, and I suspect that that is one of the things that we would be taking a look at in order to try to bring some resolution to. I think, so long as we can maintain the intentions to cover 10 million children, everything else will  be under discussion.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would particularly think that that would be the topic I just raised, where families of four could make up to $83,000 a year and still have their children insured by taxpayers, would be one of the areas that, if we could deal with that issue, that would be a significant step on the bill, maybe not the only step necessary. But if we could now get in a situation where we could do what the vast majority of the House said they wanted to do just a few weeks ago when we definitely went  on record saying we don't want this State Child Insurance Program to go out of existence but we want to do what we can to be sure that it is meeting the real goals of the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>That would be helpful. And any efforts that we can collectively make to where we work together on this would be, I think, helpful in reaching a conclusion. And I think this too: unfortunately, I don't think many minds were changed in the last 2 weeks, and we lost 2 weeks that we could have been talking. But that's behind us now, and I'm hoping we move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other major topic that I wanted to ask a question about today to my friend was on appropriations. I've been asking every week since we started the new fiscal year, or approached the new fiscal year, when we were going to have some bills on the floor or to go to conference, rather, on bills. On the Military Quality of Life bill, the Senate Democrats have been named to the conference. The Senate Republicans have been named to the conference. The House Republicans have been named to the conference.  And I'm wondering if the gentleman has any sense of when we might actually see something now begin to happen on these appropriations bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400075" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish I could give you some good sense of where we are with all of that. As you know, these discussions are taking place. The rules are a little bit different with the Senate than they are with us. We've done our work here on the House side. I would hope that those conference committees will get ready real soon. I'm sure that we'll take them up as soon as they are ready, and I hope that will be very soon. I have no sense as to when that will be. I'm very hopeful, like you are, I'm sure, that  it will all be between now and November 16.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, I appreciate the gentleman's view on that. I am hopeful. I think we've got a handful of bills that have been approved now by both the House and the Senate, bills reported over to the House from the Senate; and my view is that we're beyond the time when we should have been reaching some conclusions on these bills, and urge the majority to work with the minority and find a way to get these bills done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think in the Mil Qual Veterans area there was a substantial increase. There's been an increase every year for the last dozen years. But a substantial increase to the tune of like $18.5 million a day in benefits to veterans and military families; and every day we let that go by just complicates the delivery of those services. And I hope we can move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back my time.</paragraph>
