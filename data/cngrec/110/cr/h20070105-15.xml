    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, first I want to congratulate our new Member for getting a bill passed in the first week. That is an incredible thing to get done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then I would like to inquire of my good friend and new majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, about the schedule for next week.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, I want to say, Mr. Whip, we congratulate you on your reelection as the whip. I have an affection for whips, as you know, the position, and I am personally advantaged by our close working relationship and respect for one another. And I think the American public hopefully will be advantaged by that. I think this House will be advantaged by that, and I look forward to working with my good friend, ROY BLUNT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, all of us on our side appreciated the very gracious remarks of your leader, Mr. Boehner, when introducing Speaker Pelosi and passing the gavel to her. We know that is a difficult role. It was a difficult role for Mr. Gephardt when in 1995 he had that responsibility, and it was a difficult role for Ms. Pelosi on the two occasions she had to do it. Your leader was extraordinarily gracious and positive in that role, and we appreciate that and we want you to  know that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10:30 a.m. for morning hour and at noon for legislative business. Under the suspension calendar, we will consider a resolution mourning the passing of President Gerald Ford. That resolution, I would tell the Members, the principal sponsor of which is Mr. VERN EHLERS, our colleague on your side of the aisle, who represents the district which was so ably and effectively represented by President Ford for such a long period of time, a quarter of a century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we will also consider <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, a bill to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and a resolution to establish a select intelligence oversight panel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will tell Mr. Blunt we expect votes to be not before 3 to 4 p.m. We had originally, as you know, thought we might come in Monday. There was a schedule conflict and we wanted to accommodate that. We are glad we did. We will try to hold votes until 3 or 4, but west coast Members will have a difficult time getting back so they ought to plan on being here on Monday unless they have an important engagement they have to attend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. We will consider <bill type="h" number="2">H.R. 2</bill>, a bill to increase the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. We will consider <bill type="h" number="3">H.R. 3</bill>, a bill regarding stem cell research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And on Friday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. We will consider <bill type="h" number="4">H.R. 4</bill>, a bill regarding the Medicare prescription drug program. We expect the last votes to be hopefully no later than 2 p.m.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The practice, as you know, will be that we will come in at 6:30 on Mondays and adjourn no later than 2 p.m. on the day of adjournment. Many times that will be Friday, sometimes it will be Thursday. We understand the need for Members to get out. If it is on Thursday, the expectation is we may go a little later than that, but that will be generally the practice we will try to pursue.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague for responding. As he mentioned, we have had a great working relationship as the whips of the two parties and look forward to working with him in his new job as the leader of the majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, too, thought yesterday was an historic day for the House, and a day that our Members all appreciated the historic nature of the day. Particularly on this side of the aisle, we appreciated the Speaker's comments about moving towards partnership as opposed to partisanship; and we, of course, are eager to see a little more of that partnership again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We paid close attention during the election and after the election to the commitments to the new majority to have bills available in an earlier way and to have committee and subcommittee markup. I assume the work next week is work the majority decided will not be able to go through the subcommittee process or the committee process, and I yield to my friend to respond to that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>The gentleman's assumption is correct. Pursuant to the rule that was adopted today, we will be moving the six items that we obviously  campaigned on, told the American public that we would move on within the first 100 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe almost all of those items have been broadly discussed, considered, not only in the election process of approximately 6 months in duration or longer, but also, for instance, the 9/11 Commission report which we will consider in the first order of business next week, vetted by the bipartisan commission, the 9/11 Commission, chaired by Governor Kean and co-chaired by Mr. Hamilton, so that the gentleman's assumption is correct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that does not mean, I want to make it very clear, that does not mean that when we get through those items which essentially were the items focused on during the course of the election, that we will not hew to what we believe to be a positive step forward in including both sides in deliberations, in conference reports, in committees and on the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>As you know, most of our Members voted against the rule which brings these issues to the floor without the chance to offer an alternative. We believe there is a desire to create more opportunities for alternatives, but the sooner that can happen, I think the more effectively we will show to the American people that we are finding ways to work together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had a pledge also of at least 24 hours of notice on the specifics of legislation. It doesn't seem to me that is quite as onerous a pledge to meet in the context of what my friend just said as going through a subcommittee, going through a committee. We didn't feel like we had that 24-hour access to information this week. We would hope next week to have the specifics of the legislation as early as possible. If in fact this is legislation that doesn't need to go through the committees because  it has been so widely discussed and vetted, it would not seem to be unreasonable for everybody in the body, every Member to have a chance to see it even as early as Monday.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I think the gentleman is correct and I am glad the gentleman said "as early as Monday." It is my understanding those bills will be available to you this afternoon, and properly so. We want you to have the opportunity and the American public to have an opportunity to read and see those bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding that all of those bills will be introduced by the close of business today so they will be available to be read over the weekend and before Monday, and certainly before we come back on Tuesday.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for the response. Seeing the legislation is obviously helpful. We are really regretful we don't have a chance to offer an alternative in the real-time. We will look at the legislation. We will see if we can find a suggestion that will help meet the goals that we agree with in a more effective way. That 24-hour notice from now on we would hope would be a pledge that the majority will be able to retain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My good friend Mr. Hoyer mentioned the 9/11 Commission report. One of the recommendations of that commission was a realignment of committees. We didn't make that realignment of committees in the rules package. I wonder if there is any plan for that kind of realignment, and I would yield to the leader for that response.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the whip for that observation. That was one of the important recommendations that the commission made. Those recommendations were made, of course, over a year ago, I think. I am not sure of the exact date, but over a year ago. Your side did not implement that particular recommendation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman is correct, we have not implemented the recommendation as recommended. What Speaker Pelosi has done, she has discussed with Leader Boehner what I would refer to as a hybrid of that, not perfect from I think the Commission standpoint, but meeting in spirit what the Commission wanted to do. What the Commission wanted to do was empower the Intelligence Committee with a participation in the appropriations process, which the Commission perceived would give them a greater  relevance and greater influence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We agree with that; so as you know, we have suggested and are implementing a hybrid where the members of the Intelligence Committee and members of the Defense Appropriations Committee will meet and work together to accomplish that objective. We hope that will move towards effecting what the Commission wanted to achieve, while, at the same time, maintaining the jurisdictional issues which, as you know, in this body can become very, very acutely debated.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for the response.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You may very well have said and I may not have heard, in terms of us seeing the bills for next week, would you expect that to happen by what time today?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>They are being introduced today and very frankly, Mr. Whip, I can't give you a time because I don't know. If I knew, I would give it to you.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Do you expect them to be introduced all at once, or will some be available earlier than others?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am told <bill type="h" number="3">H.R. 3</bill> was just introduced, is already in the hopper, and obviously others will come. It is my belief, it has been represented to me that all of the bills that will be considered next week will be introduced as of close of business today so that you will have the balance of today, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and most of Tuesday to review those bills.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Certainly seeing the legislation is a step in the right direction. We believe another step in the right direction will be to be able to offer the amendments and go through the process that the majority assured us in the recent campaign will be part of their procedure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the Tuesday schedule, I have had one Member come up to me during our discussion and wanted me to ask if there is any possibility that 3 to 4 votes could slip closer to 5 just because of a number of travel concerns that Members have, particularly west coast members.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>We could try. But let me say in all fairness, our original intent was to meet and have votes at 6:30 on Monday. There is a very important event happening Monday night, particularly for those who live in Ohio and Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the spirit of comity, and I know if Maryland were playing, I would want to be accommodated and I want to accommodate my friend, Mr. Boehner. So we have done that; but it has put us in a position where we thought we would have come back Monday. That is not the case. We will have votes as late as possible, but we cannot guarantee. That leaves us a shorter period of time to do the work we have scheduled. So I cannot guarantee, but we are going to try to keep it for your Members' sake,  for our Members' sake, and we understand the west coast travel issue, as late as we can in the day, but cannot guarantee later than 3:30 or 4 o'clock.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, I would suggest to my good friend, having tried to put these schedules together for a while, that particularly for our west coast Members, if they get here on Monday to be here for a 3:30 vote on Tuesday and then find that that Tuesday vote doesn't occur until 5:30 or 6 o'clock, there is always real anxiety about the day that costs their families, and I know my good friend is going to try his very best to give us the best schedule. My only suggestion would be if you do see that  it might slip into that later time that that will be helpful to Members who, frankly, are having to decide when to leave their districts and to come a day early just to be here for that 3:30 vote as opposed to a 5:30 vote or 5 o'clock vote that might have allowed them to leave that day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with that, does my friend have any response to that?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>The good news is I know that I will get great empathy from you and Mr. Boehner on this challenge. The second response would be I want you to know, and you know this from our personal relationship, we will work very closely with you and Mr. Boehner to try to accommodate our Members. If we are going to be a civil body, if we are going to have civility, that means that we are going to have an understanding of the challenges facing each and every one of our Members irrespective  of party and we intend to do that. I personally intend to do that, and we will work towards that. Obviously, there are times when Members are inconvenienced because we have 435, and  it is just tough to accommodate everybody's interests; but to the extent we can do so, it is our absolute intent to do so. And I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for his response. I would say that there clearly will be days in this Congress when we just simply don't agree with the goal that we are trying to achieve on the two sides of the aisle, but I think we can find many more days when we do agree. We are optimistic about the concept of partnership as opposed to partisanship and look forward to having the bills today for next week and an extended debate in the future beyond the debate that we feel we will be allowed  to have next week.</paragraph>
