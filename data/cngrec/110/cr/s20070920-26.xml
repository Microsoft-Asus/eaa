  <speaking speaker="300058" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to publicly honor and recognize one of South Dakota's favorite daughters, Eleanor McGovern, who died on January 25, 2007, at the age of 85. A memorial service is being held today for Eleanor, and I know my colleagues all join with me in expressing our sympathies to the McGovern family. While we do mourn her passing, we also celebrate her extraordinarily successful life working to better the lives of the people of South Dakota and people around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Woonsocket, SD, in 1921, Eleanor grew up on a farm during the Dust Bowl years of the 1930s. Her strong work ethic and her lifelong concern and compassion for others were instilled in her by her childhood experiences. When her mother died when she was 12 years old, Eleanor and her twin sister, Ila, took over all household responsibilities, helping their father raise their younger sister. Eleanor attended high school in Woonsocket and met her future husband, former Senator George McGovern,  while attending Dakota Wesleyan University. After graduation she worked as a legal secretary before marrying Senator McGovern on October 31, 1943.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout her life, Eleanor achieved many impressive accomplishments. She was a board member of Dakota Wesleyan University, the Psychiatric Institute, the Child Study Association, the Erickson Institute of Chicago, and Odyssey House of New York. Eleanor also volunteered for the Child Development Center. She was named an Outstanding Citizen in 1975 by Dakota Wesleyan University and awarded an honorary doctorate in humane letters in 1997.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to all these accomplishments she was a devoted mother of five. Throughout the years, she provided a stable and loving home environment for her children and helped facilitate her husband's service to the Nation. During Senator McGovern's Presidential campaign, he described her as his most helpful critic and most trusted adviser.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eleanor also authored her memoir, "Uphill: A Personal Story," which was published in 1973. Following the death of her daughter Terry in 1994, she showed remarkable courage by speaking publicly about the tragedy of alcoholism and how it impacted her family. In addition, she helped establish the McGovern Family Foundation for researching alcoholism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thoughout her life she worked tirelessly to improve the lives of others, especially the lives of women and children; she published articles on child development while also traveling the Nation to address the problems facing American families. There are few people who have done as much to better the lives of the women and children of South Dakota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eleanor is survived by her husband Senator McGovern; 4 children--Ann McGovern, Susan McGovern, Mary McGovern-McKinnon, and Steve McGovern--10 grandchildren; and 6 great-grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with great honor that I speak of the accomplishments of Eleanor McGovern and with great sadness that I mark her passing.</paragraph>
