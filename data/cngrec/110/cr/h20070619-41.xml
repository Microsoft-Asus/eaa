    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on Friday of last week, the House took up 26 sequential votes on amendments to the 2008 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, <bill type="h" number="2638">H.R. 2638</bill>. The fourth of these votes was on an amendment by the gentlelady from Virginia, Representative Drake, which increased funding for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's 287(g) program. This program funds training and activity of State and local law enforcement personnel to carry out Federal immigration law.  I believe that immigration law is and should be the responsibility of Federal border and Customs officials, and not delegated to the States and local authorities who are already burdened with protecting their communities. I, therefore, do not support the Drake amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On roll number 469 when I cast my vote on this amendment, however, an "aye" vote was recorded when a "no" vote should have been recorded.</paragraph>
