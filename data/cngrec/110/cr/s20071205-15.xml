  <narrative>THE FARM BILL -- (Senate - December 05, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14757">S14757</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the negotiations on the farm bill and to ask my Republican colleagues to think very carefully--especially the farm State colleagues--about the circumstance we face with respect to the farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority leader made an offer to the Republican leader during the break that we would have a chance to move forward if they could do 10 amendments on their side and we can do 5 amendments on our side; that 2 of their 10 be unrelated to the farm bill, and that we have 2 additional amendments, and the bipartisan amendments that have been filed would not count against either allocation. That offer was made to Senator McConnell, and Senator McConnell has not yet answered or  counteroffered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the Republican leader will indicate how we could proceed. If there is  a need for additional amendments--apparently, Senator Harkin indicated it would be reasonable if there were 17 perhaps on their side and 14 on our side. Whatever the number is that would help us reach a conclusion would be very important for our being able to advance the legislation that came out of the committee, without a dissenting vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are 21 Members of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Republicans and Democrats. This farm bill came out without a single dissenting vote. It is paid for, it is less costly than the President's farm proposal, and it has the beginnings of reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a reasonable offer. Certainly, Senator Reid made it. If you look at previous farm bills, typically the number of recorded votes have been about 20 amendments, sometimes a bit more, sometimes a bit less. On average, there have been around 20 amendments that have actually been voted on. Senator Reid's proposal would have 17 rollcall votes before final passage. So that would be a bit below the average. The leader has made clear that if there are some additional amendments  that are required in order to advance this proposal, he is open to doing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current farm bill expires this year. Farmers need to know and their bankers need to know what the rules of the road are going to be. So it is absolutely essential we get this legislation through the Senate and we have an opportunity to go to conference with the House to work out the differences in the early part of next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me make one final point, if I may. Some are saying just extend the current farm bill by a year or two. First of all, we know that if it is a 1-year extension, it will be 2 years because next year is an election year. Beyond that, our colleagues should know the baseline for writing a farm bill is based on the last 5 years of experience with farm legislation. That baseline is already down substantially because the last farm bill cost $17 billion less than the estimates at the time it was written.  That baseline is going to go only in one direction for the commodity provisions at least, and that is down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So anybody who is concerned about writing a farm bill that meets the needs of the American people--not just the commodity title but nutrition, conservation, research, and all the rest--should understand this noose is going to do nothing but get tighter. It is already very tight--very tight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope our colleagues on the other side bend their best efforts to come up with a response to the proposal the majority leader made to reach conclusion, and I hope they do it soon. The clock is ticking. American farm and ranch families across this country are waiting. We should not ask them to wait past Christmas. So much needs to be done, so many decisions need to be made, but Congress needs to act now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
