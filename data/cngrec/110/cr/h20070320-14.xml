    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there are a lot of clever words for quitting in Iraq: withdrawal, realignment, redeployment, the terms go on and on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cloud of defeatism grows larger and larger in Washington, D.C. Numerous pieces of legislation have been introduced in this House, from outright retreat and withdrawal to letting Congress become the generals of the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Taking money from the war effort leaves our troops there at risk. There seems to be three alternatives: retreat with defeat; stalemate, which seems to be the current situation of fighting not to lose; or, three, supply more troops to the ones that are there so they can finish the job and then come home. The third choice seems to be the wisest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress tried to tie the pursestrings in the Vietnam War. Congress tried to prematurely bring the troops home in Vietnam, and we know the results in Vietnam. We fought that war as if not to lose it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is in the best interest of the United States to help our military finish their mission in Iraq and stabilize Iraq before we leave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
