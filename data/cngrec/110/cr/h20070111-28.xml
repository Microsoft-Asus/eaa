  <speaking speaker="400160" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, we will vote on a bill to provide changes to a merciless Federal stem cell policy, changes that are still relevant and still necessary despite the recent discovery of stem cells derived from amniotic fluid cells.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To be sure, this is an important discovery, but the same scientists championing this research have stressed the amniotic cells are not a substitute for embryonic stem cells. While they hold the great promise of turning into some cell types, only embryonic stem cells can divide indefinitely and evolve into any cell type in the body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If anything, the recent amniotic stem cell study proves that it is critical to explore all kinds of stem cell research, since advancements in one area of stem cell research could lead to lifesaving discoveries in others. By prohibiting Federal funds of more embryonic stem cell research, the current policy shuts the door on this collaborative research and slams it in the face of millions of Americans suffering from incurable diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the opportunity today to advance this promising research that could offer cures for the scourges of our times. To purposefully keep the doors to a cure closed is a patent failure of our responsibility to ease human suffering from scores of incurable diseases.</paragraph>
