  <speaking speaker="400165" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to request that my name be withdrawn as a cosponsor of <bill type="hj" number="40">H.J. Res. 40</bill>. After further reflection, I have concerns that this legislation, which would propose an amendment to the Constitution relative to equal rights for men and women, could potentially compromise my longtime stance on pro-life issues. I hope that clarifying language can be added to this bill to offer assurances to pro-life supporters that this measure would not be used to undermine Federal laws  on this important matter.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas?</chair>
