  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is understood that overall America's health care facilities face a decline in the quality of their staff. But South Carolina is graciously blessed with Dr. James L. Coleman, Jr., whose mission it is to improve the ways we provide the best and accessible primary and preventive health care to folks in our State who lack the means for quality medical care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently serving as chief executive officer of the Margaret J. Weston Medical Center, Dr. Coleman is known for providing a message of diversity in health care. He and his staff at the medical center understand that in order to have healthy citizens, it is essential to provide affordable health care services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With degrees from Winthrop, Central Arkansas and a doctorate of education from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Dr. Coleman is a teacher and local crusader for the improvement of lives by the improvement of health services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During February's Black History Month, I would like to recognize Dr. Coleman. His efforts to provide better health care to underprivileged South Carolina citizens has not gone unnoticed.</paragraph>
