    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I heard the gentlelady speak a moment ago about some of the statements made about Majority Leader Reid in  the Senate, and she condemned people for criticizing him for what he said about the war being lost. But I haven't heard anybody over there say anything good about the President, who is trying to protect us against terrorism around the world, which is emanating from the Middle East and al Qaeda. Al Qaeda  are the ones that are running the opposition to the United States troops over there right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were attacked by al Qaeda. We were going to go to war to stop terrorism against al Qaeda. And nobody is saying anything good about the President, who is trying to protect this country, and if we say one thing about the majority leader on the other side we are supposed to be condemned. I don't understand it. I just don't understand it.</paragraph>
