  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400209" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Armed Services Chairman Ike Skelton for including language in this year's Defense authorization bill to change the name of the Department of the Navy to be the Department of the Navy and Marine Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank Ranking Member Duncan Hunter who in the past has also included this language in the Defense authorization bill. This will be the sixth year that the House will send legislation to the Senate that supports this change. I hope that this year the Senate will agree that this change is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1947, Congress has twice affirmed that the Marine Corps is a separate military service within the Department of the Navy. In 1947, the National Security Act stated that we have four separate military services:  the Army, the Air Force, the Navy and the Marine Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1986, the Goldwater-Nichols Act stated that each service's commanding officer serves equally as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That is, the Marine Corps and the Navy are coequal partners. The Marines do not serve beneath the Navy; they are an equal team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, that is why I have again introduced legislation, <bill type="h" number="346">H.R. 346</bill>, to recognize their coequal status by changing the name of the Department of the Navy to the Department of the Navy and Marine Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only has this change received the full House Armed Services Committee support, but also from former Navy secretaries and Marine Corps commandants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a statement of support for this legislation, the Honorable Wade Sanders, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Reserve Affairs, 1993-1998, stated, and I quote, "As a combat veteran and former Naval officer, I understand the importance of the team dynamic, and the importance of recognizing the contribution of team components. The Navy and Marine Corps team is just that: a dynamic partnership, and is important to symbolically recognize the balance of that partnership."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, General Charles Krulak, 31st Commandant of the Marine Corps stated, and I quote, "This bill is a perfectly logical evolution in a series of legislative initiatives designed, in part, to clarify and codify the role of the United States Marine Corps. .....I enthusiastically support both the spirit and intent."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Carl Mundy, the 30th commandant of the Marine Corps stated, and I quote, "I believe the changes you propose will do much to clarify the relationship, responsibilities and functions of the appointed civilian authority over the United States Naval services ..... I believe that any Secretary--present, past or future--will be very proud to bear the title `Marine,' as well as `Navy.' "</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Honorable John Dalton, the 70th Secretary of the Navy stated, and I quote "One of the things for which I am most proud that I accomplished during my tenure was moving the headquarters of the Marine Corps into the Pentagon. It was a controversial decision, but I am convinced it was the right thing to do. ..... Your legislation would be another vital step to give that distinguished service the recognition it so greatly deserves."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I close, I want to point out to the House that I have beside me the Order of the Silver Star for Marines killed in Iraq. Marine Michael Bitz' family received a Silver Star in his memory. Yet when you look at this poster you will see an exact copy of the article for the Secretary of the Navy, Washington D.C., and the Navy flag.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All this legislation will do, all this legislation will do, is to make the Navy and the Marine Corps an equal partner. You can see if these orders were issued and this bill had become law, it would say the Secretary of the Navy and the Marine Corps with the Navy flag and the Marine flag for this brave marine who gave his life for this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope this year that the House under the leadership of Ike Skelton will demand that the Senate agree to the House position and change the name to be the Department of Navy and Marine Corps.</paragraph>
