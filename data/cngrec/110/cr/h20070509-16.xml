    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it appears that congressional Republicans are finally coming around to the possibility that the war in Iraq cannot go on indefinitely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This weekend House Republican leader John Boehner said if this troop escalation plan is not working by September or October, a plan B would need to be explored. This timid response is a sign that the Republicans see the writing on the wall and are desperate to hedge their bets on a failed policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The minority leader's timetable of this fall comes just days after Mr. Boehner joined President Bush in abandoning the benchmarks for Iraqi success the President himself established in January. Last week the minority leader and almost every Republican joined the President's call for an open-ended commitment of American troops and tax dollars in Iraq. Now feeling the pressure from the Americans who wisely support benchmarks and timelines, it appears that the Republican leader is backtracking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people and the majority of this Congress will stand firm in supporting our troops and showing leadership for a new course in Iraq. Let's hope the minority leader lifts his head out of the sand, and he and his party and the President join us in moving Iraq in a new direction.</paragraph>
