    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on Monday, we passed a resolution recognizing AmeriCorps Week. While AmeriCorps' particular design provides a tuition reward, true volunteering comes with the expectation of nothing in return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A woman from my hometown of Ocala, Florida so embodies pure selflessness that I would like to praise her today publicly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Carson Faris is a registered nurse and a certified occupational health nurse specialist with E-One. However, her caregiving nature does not end there. Nurse Faris mentors addicted women through the rocky path of recovery. Further, in addition to her own 10 pets, she shelters at-risk cats and serves on the board of directors for the Humane Society of Marion County and volunteers at the animal shelter. Also, she serves as an advisory board member for the Marion County unit of the Florida Blood  Centers. Oh, and by the way, she is the treasurer of the Florida State Association of Occupational Health Nurses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nurse Faris shines as a beacon of true volunteerism.</paragraph>
