    <paragraph>Mr. President, this momentous achievement that helps so many millions of Americans would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of our staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of my own staff, I want to give a special thank you to Lauren McGarity for her strong commitment, her deep knowledge, and her hard work on this issue over many months. Lauren, you have really made a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Portia Wu for her help and leadership and especially her able work over the past 2 weeks in handling the many amendments to this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks also to Missy Rohrbach for helping us manage the floor schedule and for all she does so well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks, too, to Jonathan McCracken, Jeff Teitz, Dave Ryan, Esther Olavarria, and Laura Capps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As always, I am grateful also for the leadership of Michael Myers, who has been with me for many years as staff director of our HELP Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But above all my special thanks go to Holly Fechner, my chief labor counsel. This momentous vote is a tribute to her--to her skill, professionalism, and deep dedication to those who are the backbone of this country. Working men and women in America could not have a better friend and champion. Holly is a true leader, and we all owe her a great debt today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Senator ENZI's staff, too. Katherine McGuire, Ilysse Schuman, Brian Hayes, Kyle Hicks, and Greg Dean. They are real professionals. It is a pleasure to work with them, and I thank them for their courtesies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks, too, to Senator BAUCUS' able staff for making this victory possible--Russ Sullivan, Pat Heck, and Bill Dauster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And special thanks for the able leadership of Senator Reid's staff, especially Darrel Thompson and Bob Greenawalt. And, of course, Marty Paone, Lula Davis, Tim Mitchell, and Trish Engle as well.</paragraph>
