  <narrative>HOUSING AND THE ECONOMY -- (Senate - March 31, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="2207">S2207</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, 76 years ago, Franklin Roosevelt, who was then the Governor of New York, was engaged in a fierce Presidential campaign. The country was reeling from the stock market crash of 1929. Consumer confidence in banks had plummeted. The Great Depression was in full force at that time, and the American people had lost confidence that President Herbert Hoover had what it took to lead the country out of economic darkness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In April 1932, Governor Roosevelt, seeking the Democratic nomination for President, took to the radio waves and said this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not want to limit myself to politics. I do not want to feel that I am addressing an audience of Democrats or that I speak merely as a Democrat myself. The present condition of our national affairs is too serious to be viewed through partisan eyes for partisan purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He went on to say that troubled times call for us to:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>put [our] faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid....... The two billion dollar fund which President Hoover and Congress have put at the disposal of big banks, the railroads and the corporations is not for [the average person].</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here should be an objective of government itself--to provide at least as much assistance to the little fellow as it is now giving to the large banks and corporations. This is [an] example of building from the bottom up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the more things change, the more they seem to stay the same. Recently, the Federal Reserve provided taxpayers' money to prevent the collapse of Bear Stearns. The Fed took the additional unprecedented step of opening its discount lending window to securities firms, even though--unlike banks--those firms aren't regulated by the Fed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the need to take some bold steps. I believe the Federal Reserve is doing what they think is best in the face of a deep and growing economic crisis. While on principle the spirit of capitalism would call for Wall Street firms to shoulder the burden of loss along with the spoils of profit, it is incumbent upon our Government to look for the greater good. But we must not neglect the lessons of history. If we agree that it is a responsibility of Government to provide liquidity and security  to the titans of Wall Street--and we do--then how can we think it is any less our responsibility to do the same for Main Street?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people are suffering. We are paying more than ever for gasoline, groceries, and heat for our homes. Home values are falling--in January  alone, almost 13 percent. Millions face foreclosure, and communities are suffering because of the housing meltdown. This crisis is real, it is immediate, and it calls for Congress to take action. Every day that Congress and the President do nothing is another day closer to another</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American family losing their home. This is not the time for politics or partisanship. It is, as President Roosevelt said, time to give some "assistance to the little fellow"--those were his words--it is time to do the right thing, the responsible thing, for the American people--the little fellow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last work period, Democrats introduced a housing bill. The President and his Republican Senators filibustered and blocked this much needed legislation. This legislation is not a catch-all or a silver bullet, but financial experts agree it is a good start. If passed, it would have an immediate positive impact on struggling homeowners and hard-hit neighborhoods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have talked in length about this legislation to Chairman Bernanke. I have spoken to Secretary Paulson. I think they have done good work. But I think if they were asked point blank--and I am not going to, certainly, state here publicly any of the things they said to me, but someone can ask them themselves--I think they would say our legislation is a step in the right direction. If this law passed today, it would have an immediate positive impact on struggling homeowners and hard-hit  neighborhoods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the five points of our plan:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, we help families keep their homes by increasing funds for preforeclosure counseling. It is imperative we do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, we expand refinancing opportunities for homeowners stuck in bad loans. Mortgage revenue bonds--the President said he liked that in his State of the Union Message.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, we provide funds to help the highest need communities purchase and rehabilitate foreclosed properties, as well as tax relief to struggling businesses affected by the housing downturn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, we help families avoid foreclosure in the future by improving loan disclosures and transparency during the original loan and refinancing process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifth, we amend the Bankruptcy Code to allow home loans on primary residences to be modified in certain circumstances, with very strict guidelines. We have a tax provision which is extremely important to the homebuilding industry: loss carryback. We have a program that allows the bankruptcy courts to step in on primary residences and, if necessary, help adjust those loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time we pass this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last work period, Republicans blocked a vote on this, as I have said before. One Republican Senator said that all Republicans wanted was the opportunity to propose amendments. Mr. President, I have said on this floor, I have said privately, I have said at press conferences--the record will clearly show--Democrats are happy to allow amendments. Democrats want to offer amendments. Republicans want to offer amendments. We would like nothing more than an open debate on this bill and how we might  be able to make it better. I have told my distinguished counterpart, Senator McConnell, if Republicans object to parts of our bill, they are welcome to seek enough votes to amend it, to change it. That is how the legislative process is supposed to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be a fool's errand to put our proposal up and the Republican proposal up and move to invoke cloture on each one of those. It would take 60 votes. That is not what we need to do. It would be failure for sure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why don't we move forward on our bill? There will be a vote at 2:15 tomorrow. If my colleagues want to have a limited number of amendments, fine, let's have a limited number of amendments dealing with this problem. Experts say we are in a crisis and have to do something now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I respect Secretary Paulson very much. I like Secretary Paulson. The proposals he made at 10 o'clock today are certainly worth considering, but they are not going to do one simple thing to help the people who are now in foreclosure--nothing. It is for the future. That deals with the future. We need to deal with the present. But so far my Republican friends have not allowed this bill to proceed to the point at which amendments can be offered. In short, they have stalled this necessary help to  working Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tomorrow, we will have another opportunity to work on this piece of legislation. We cannot sit on our hands. We cannot take a wait-and-see approach. And we cannot embrace the status quo as the economy continues to deteriorate. Let's legislate. Let's work to help beleaguered Americans. Democrats have no agenda but to get this bill passed quickly and fairly so the American people can reap the benefits. If we are able to pass this legislation, it will be one where credit can go to everybody. This  is something we need to do. We cannot do it alone. We have 51 Senators. They have 49. We have to do this together or it will not be done at all. In America's darkest economic hour, that was the leadership Franklin Roosevelt showed--and that is what we must do as we face our own crisis today.</paragraph>
