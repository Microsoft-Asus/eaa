  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO HARRY LEE -- (Senate - October 01, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12347">S12347</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak just very briefly about a loss Louisiana has suffered--and, in many ways, the Nation--of a great political leader, a great political figure, and a friend to many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this morning, Sheriff Harry Lee of Jefferson Parish passed away after a battle with leukemia. As my colleagues know, I come from a place of rich political heritage, colorful characters, and of amazing and fantastic stories at times about our political figures. Among the most colorful, though, was Sheriff Harry Lee, who stood out and stood tall for so many years. He served the people of Jefferson Parish since 1979 as their sheriff, but he started life in Louisiana in a much more humble  way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Harry was born in the back room of a Chinese laundry in downtown New Orleans to immigrant parents, Bing and Yip Lee, who instilled in him a strong and very determined spirit that would serve him well and serve all of us well for the rest of his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After a promising educational start at Francis T. Nicholls, where he served as both senior class president and student body president, Harry went on to college at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. He joined the ROTC Program there and was recognized early on as an outstanding cadet. He didn't stop there, though. His next step was to serve the country in the Air Force during the height of the Cold War. He served in the famous Strategic Command. His Air Force career led him to make a great  decision in life, and that was to marry Lai Beet Woo, his wife of 40 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Harry returned to Louisiana, he took over the family restaurant and convinced his father to allow him to attend law school. He excelled and became the first Federal magistrate for the Eastern District of Louisiana. He soon then, through many political contacts and his great spirit and gregarious nature and classwork, became parish attorney for Jefferson Parish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, in 1975 and shortly thereafter, he was elected sheriff, a post he held for more than two decades, and he became a household name in Louisiana. This story has probably been tracked by others, but for Harry Lee, who comes from a Chinese-American background, at the time he was elected sheriff I think he was the highest ranking Chinese official and the only Chinese-American sheriff in the country. He was always extremely proud of that, proud of his heritage, always reminding us of that singular  accomplishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After being a larger-than-life force in the realm of criminal justice for over 30 years, as I said this morning, he finally lost his own battle with leukemia. He had fought and won many battles on the streets in Jefferson Parish, in the courtrooms, and also in the court of public opinion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Harry Lee's success says something important about our country--the son of immigrants who goes on to not only serve his parish, his city, his region, but went on to befriend Presidents, Republicans and Democrats, being the go-to person when people of great political distinction would come to our State. They always wanted to see and talk with Harry Lee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like all of us in public life, his tenure was not without controversy, but he was fiercely loyal to his deputies. There are thousands of deputies, current and former, who are mourning his passing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Looking back on a life like this, you can only think that his father and mother, Bing Yip Lee, who have long passed away, must have looked down and smiled on their son's accomplishments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The loss of this singular figure in Louisiana politics is not only a loss to Jefferson Parish and to the State of Louisiana, but it is a loss to this great country that we all try our best to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to extend my heartfelt condolences to the Lee family, to the deputies, to the law enforcement officials of Jefferson Parish in our State who are mourning this loss today. I hope we will all take some solace from the fact that they are being joined by so many mourners who recognize and appreciate a life well lived.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, a not-so-secret hobby of Harry's was singing. I cannot say he would have ever made records, but he tried and he sang with great zest. At many jazz fests, he would be tempted to the stage by his friend Willie Nelson. They would often sing together. His favorite song was "Welcome to My World." I would like to say to Harry today: Thank you for welcoming us to your world, Sheriff Lee. You served us well, and you will be missed.</paragraph>
