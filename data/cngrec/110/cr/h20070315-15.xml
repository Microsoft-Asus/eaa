  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there is a common misconception in Washington that simply talking about a problem is as good as solving it. However, we know that actions speak louder than words. In 34 of the last 38 years, the Federal Government hasn't balanced its own checkbook.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time Washington stop looking for ways to afford bigger government. Yesterday, the Republican Study Committee introduced the Taxpayer Bill of Rights to restore budget accountability to Washington's checkbook, and it couldn't come at a better time. It is imperative that we prioritize America's financial responsibilities and reform the way Washington spends hard-earned taxpayer money. We can't expect different results if we keep on doing the same thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is all about accountability, about reducing wasteful Washington spending, about balancing the budget, about fundamental tax reform, and about adapting programs to America's changing demographics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights isn't merely a slogan, it's a solution, a way we should all be thinking. Imagine this positive change to the way Washington spends hard-earned taxpayer money. Just imagine.</paragraph>
