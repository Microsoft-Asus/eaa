  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the need for this Congress to address the rising energy costs across America. Gas prices are continuing to rise, and our energy needs across our country continue to increase. The American people expect us to do something about this, to solve the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet the liberal leadership of this Congress is missing in action. Instead of  coming forward with a real plan to solve our energy problems, they are preparing to recreate the energy crisis of the late 1970s. Are the American people really ready for long lines, rationing, and higher prices?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The policies of the 1970s should have been a wake-up call for us. But instead of instituting a plan for American energy independence back then, we just kicked that can a little further down the road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today, my GOP colleagues and I will unveil a multi-tiered plan that focuses on innovative ways to create new American sources of power through conservation exploration and cutting-edge technologies. We will act to fill the need.</paragraph>
