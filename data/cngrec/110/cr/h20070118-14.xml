    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the majority party will increase taxes on American oil companies and, hence, on all Americans. And they will increase our dependence on foreign oil. This will complete the sixth item of the majority party's initial agenda. This is the sixth time, but certainly not the last time, that Democrats will put forth a policy that fills a sound bite, but not sound policy. And according to a Democrat clock that stops and starts when it is politically convenient,  they will be completed within 100 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While those from across the aisle will pat themselves on the back, this is no cause for celebration. Adopting legislation without allowing consideration by any committee, or even a single amendment, is not a reason to celebrate. Applying the rules of the House only when they serve your purpose are no rules at all. And a blatant disregard to follow through on promises made in November shatters the trust of the American people and is no reason to celebrate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the people's House. It thrives when ideas are wrestled with and challenged. The best ideas and solutions then rise to the top.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American people are watching. Doing anything less is no reason to celebrate.</paragraph>
