    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I will vote for the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act. I agree with the 70 percent of Americans who want our troops out of Iraq. And I agree with the comprehensive report called "Strategic Reset" from the Center for American Progress, written by three authors, one of whom is Lawrence Korb, former Assistant Secretary of Defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They write, "The current Iraq strategy is exactly what al Qaeda wants, the United States distracted and pinned down by Iraq's internal conflicts, trapped in a quagmire that has become the perfect rallying cry and recruitment tool for al Qaeda. The United States has no good options, given the strategic and tactical mistakes made in Iraq since 2002, but simply staying the course with an indefinite military presence is not advancing U.S. interests."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we will vote to change the course to bring our troops home by April of 2008. I will proudly vote in favor of that bill.</paragraph>
