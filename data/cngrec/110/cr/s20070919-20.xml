    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the outstanding accomplishments of Windows on the Water, a popular restaurant from my home State of Maine. Windows on the Water's chef and owner, John Hughes, was recently awarded the National Restaurant Association Award for his active role in assisting the local community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded in June 1985, Windows on the Water has been a favorite of locals and visitors to the Kennebunk-Kennebunkport area for over 20 years. Known for its fresh seafood and made-from-scratch desserts, Windows on the Water boasts a diverse menu with something for everyone. Moreover, it is committed to preparing healthy meals for diners. As such, most of the cooking products used are either organic, all-natural, or sustainable. In its 22 years of business, Windows on the Water has received 27 awards  for various accomplishments. As patrons of the restaurant will tell you, Windows on the Water is also renowned for its creativity. In addition to providing fresh, quality food, Chef Hughes frequently offers programs such as cooking class dinners, which include a multicourse demonstration and meal, combined with a question-and-answer session.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chef Hughes's National Restaurant Association award is truly something to be proud of. Dedicating his life to helping others, including by way of his culinary skills, Mr. Hughes cofounded the Community Harvest organization in 1999, a nonprofit community service group that provides food to those in need. The organization's motto, "people loving people is the heart of the journey, the heart of our community," is exemplified well in Chef Hughes's work. Each Thanksgiving and Christmas, he prepares  countless dinners for the community, which volunteers then deliver to local underprivileged households and individuals. Mr. Hughes began the home delivery service because he noticed that Meals on Wheels did not deliver on Christmas and Thanksgiving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Chef Hughes routinely uses his cooking skills to benefit vulnerable members of his community, he is also at the forefront of numerous other community efforts. He leads an annual scholarship program for select local students who demonstrate a commitment to community service. Moreover, in keeping with his background as a chef, Mr. Hughes spearheads an annual scholarship program for recipients in the greater Kennebunk area who have displayed an interest in the culinary arts. Having begun his  culinary studies at age 15, Chef Hughes recognizes that nurturing an ambition from a young age can lead to great success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Windows on the Water is not only a restaurant; it is also a fount of unbridled service to others, thanks to Chef Hughes. While Chef Hughes has reached the top of his profession, being appointed to the Master Chefs Institute of America, he still sees the crucial role that generosity and giving play in the livelihood of a community. I commend Chef John Hughes and everyone at Windows on the Water who set a valuable example for the Kennebunks, and for all of Maine.</paragraph>
