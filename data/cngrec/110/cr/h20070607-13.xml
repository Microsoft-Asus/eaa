  <speaking speaker="400061" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on March 21 of this year, a West Virginia leader in work site safety, J.F. Allen Company, marked a milestone of 1 million safe hours of work. I rise today to honor the company and join its employees in celebrating this outstanding accomplishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Established as a small family business, J.F. Allen Company has grown into one of the largest heavy highway construction firms in our State. The company's contributions can be seen in all corners of my district, including Stonewall Jackson Dam and Interstates 79 and 81.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>J.F. Allen's contributions to the State are critical to our infrastructure development and maintenance. However, it is their commitment to employee safety that is the most important contribution to West Virginia. Thanks in large part to an award-winning safety program, employees are safe at work, logging 1 million safe hours since 1994.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, small businesses are the heart of our economy, especially in rural States like West Virginia. J.F. Allen Company's record of worker safety and commercial achievement is a model for all companies and represents the very best of West Virginia's workers and businesses.</paragraph>
