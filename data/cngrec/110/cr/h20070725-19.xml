    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle are often quick to criticize corporate America for everything from outsourcing jobs to poor health care and retirement benefits for their workers. However, we have some very responsible corporate citizens that we call the Big Three. And over the last century, the Big Three have been the leaders in providing health care benefits and retirement benefits as well for their workers. These efforts were actually crucial  in building up the American middle class. GM, for example, spent $3.3 billion last year on health  benefits for their 432,000 retirees. In comparison, non-U.S. auto manufacturers spent roughly just $23 million for their 1,200 American workers and American retirees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And one would think that after decades of commitment the Big Three have shown to the American worker that that would earn them the admiration and the sympathy of the Democratic leadership. Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case. The Democratic leadership that should be holding up the domestic auto industry as models of corporate responsibility are instead trying to ram through increased CAFE standards that will put U.S. auto workers in the unemployment line and likely bankrupt U.S auto  companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to reject these policies which will help our foreign competitors, and instead stand up for American jobs.</paragraph>
