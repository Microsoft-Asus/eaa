    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, what a privilege it is to speak on National Bible Week as we celebrate the written Word of God, as we anticipate the upcoming celebration, the week of November 18-25. In fact, this book, the number one best seller of all time, the book is known as a book of encouragement, a book of enlightenment, and a book of edification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Encouragement. When I think about what the Bible has meant to me, I remember some of the great verses from the Old Testament, such as Joshua 1:9, "Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified. Do not be discouraged. For the Lord God will be with you wherever you go." And Psalm 118:13-15 says, "I was pushed back and about to fall, but the Lord has helped me. The Lord is my strength and my song, He has become my salvation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then Psalm 138:8, which precedes my favorite Psalm, 139, it says, "The Lord will accomplish that which concerns me. Your love, O Lord, endures forever."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we think of this day, when so many people are discouraged, I know, as we celebrate National Bible Week, that the Bible has been a Word of encouragement that I've experienced and I know many others have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to encouragement, it's a Word of enlightenment. Psalm 19 says, "Your Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path. The unfolding of Your Word gives light and gives understanding to the simple." And as many of my friends back home in North Carolina know, my favorite Old Testament verse is from Proverbs, 29:18, that says, "Where there is no vision, the people perish." And I think that's a great challenge to us, as leaders in this country, to have vision for where we want  to take our country and what we want to do and how we want to solve the problems. In fact, this verse, "Where there is no vision, the people perish," is inscribed in our own Science Committee room in the Rayburn House Office Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to encouragement and enlightenment, the Bible is a book of edification. Paul writes in the Book of Romans 10:17 that faith comes from hearing and hearing by the Word. And then James 1:22 reminds that we should be doers of the Word and not hearers only.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bible allows us to see ourselves through its many stories and parables and prophesies and teachings. It also shows the flaws and frailties that we all share in common in humanity. It also shows the fellowship, both human and divine, that calls forth those values that so often we look for in our society today, values of forgiveness, of faithfulness and of fulfillment in becoming all that we know that we can become.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm grateful that we take time in this country to celebrate the national week of the Bible coming up the week of November 18-25, and that we would take time tonight to celebrate not only the historical importance, but the personal importance that this great book, the best seller of all time, has for people literally the world over.</paragraph>
