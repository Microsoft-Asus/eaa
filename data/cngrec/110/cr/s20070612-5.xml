    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business for 60 minutes. The Republicans will control the first half, the Democrats the second half. Following this period of morning business, the Senate will resume postcloture debate on the motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the Energy bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have consent to move to the bill itself after the caucuses end at 2:15 today. The motion to proceed will be agreed to, and the Senate will begin consideration of the energy legislation. Senators BINGAMAN, DOMENICI, we understand BOXER and INHOFE and INOUYE, or his designee, and STEVENS, will come and talk about this bill. Hopefully, they will do it this morning to lay the groundwork for this very important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As with the competitiveness bill, this is a bipartisan bill. I remind everyone, matters that the Energy Committee reports out of their committee on a bipartisan basis are part of this bill. The same applied to Commerce; the same applied to the Environment and Public Works Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those matters the chairmen wanted out of those committees that were not bipartisan are not part of this bill. This is truly a bipartisan bill. There will be amendments offered to weaken the bill, to strengthen the bill--of course, the understanding of those words is in the eyes of the beholder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope this will be a good, strong debate. I hope people will offer amendments. We have a limited amount of time to complete a lot of work. If there are long delays, people not offering amendments, I know the managers will be saying we have to end this some way, and the "some way" that we are always forced to look at is whether we want to have a bipartisan cloture vote on ending debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's have people who want to offer amendments do it as quickly as possible. I have asked the managers of the bill, rather than wait around for people who say: I don't know if I want a vote on this, we need more time--after there has been a reasonable amount of time discussing one of these amendments, the managers should move to table the amendment. If it is not tabled, nothing is lost. We need to move along and get this legislation completed as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gas prices are going down. They have dropped a few cents the last week or two, which is good. The cost of oil coming into this country has gone up. It is now at $67 and people are saying it is going up higher, which will mean there will be an increase at the gas pumps a month or so after the cost of oil importation increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Remember, we have an obligation with this legislation. This legislation, which some people say is not strong enough, if it passes, will cut the amount of oil we use per day in this country by 4 million barrels. Think about that, 4 million barrels a day. This is a step in the right direction. I hope we can do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The setting for this is, among other things, we use 21 million barrels of oil every day. We import 65 percent of that. As I said yesterday in illustration of how much this is, it is a ditch 150 feet deep and 11 miles long filled with oil. That is how much we use every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have an obligation to the American people to lessen our dependence, to make that ditch shorter and not nearly as deep.</paragraph>
