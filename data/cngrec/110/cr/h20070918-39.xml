    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (<bill type="hc" number="207">H. Con. Res. 207</bill>) recognizing the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force as an independent military service.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.</narrative>
  <narrative>The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hc" number="207">H. Con. Res. 207</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas President Harry S. Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947 on July 26, 1947, to realign and reorganize the Armed Forces and to create a separate Department of the Air Force from the existing military services;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the National Security Act of 1947 was enacted on September 18, 1947;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Aeronautical Division of the United States Army Signal Corps, consisting of one officer and two enlisted men, began operation under the command of Captain Charles DeForest Chandler on August 1, 1907, with the responsibility for "all matters pertaining to military ballooning, air machines, and all kindred subjects";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in 1908, the Department of War contracted with the Wright brothers to build one heavier-than-air flying machine for the United States Army, and accepted the Wright Military Flyer, the world's first military airplane, in 1909;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas United States pilots, flying with both allied air forces and with the Army Air Service, performed admirably in the course of World War I, participating in pursuit, observation, and day and night bombing missions;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas pioneering aviators of the United States, including Mason M. Patrick, William "Billy" Mitchell, Benjamin D. Foulois, Frank M. Andrews, Henry "Hap" Arnold, James "Jimmy" H. Doolittle, and Edward "Eddie" Rickenbacker, were among the first to recognize the military potential of air power and courageously forged the foundations for the creation of an independent arm for air forces in the United States in the decades following World War I;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on June 20, 1941, the Department of War created the Army Air Forces (AAF) as its aviation element and shortly thereafter the Department of War made the AAF co-equal to the Army Ground Forces;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas General Henry H. "Hap" Arnold drew upon the industrial prowess and human resources of the United States to transform the Army Air Corps from a force of 22,400 men and 2,402 aircraft in 1939 to a peak wartime strength of 2.4 million personnel and 79,908 aircraft;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the standard for courage, flexibility, and intrepidity in combat was established for all Airmen during the first aerial raid in the Pacific Theater on April 18, 1942, when Lieutenant Colonel James "Jimmy" H. Doolittle led 16 North American B-25 Mitchell bombers in a joint operation from the deck of the naval carrier USS Hornet to strike the Japanese mainland in response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas President Harry S. Truman supported organizing air power as an equal arm of the military forces of the United States, writing on December 19, 1945, that air power had developed so that the responsibilities and contributions to military strategic planning of air power equaled those of land and sea power;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on September 18, 1947, W. Stuart Symington became the first Secretary of the newly formed and independent United States Air Force (USAF), and on September 26, 1947, General Carl A. Spaatz became the first Chief of Staff of the USAF;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Air National Guard was also created by the National Security Act of 1947 and has played a vital role in guarding the United States and defending freedom in nearly every major conflict and contingency since its inception;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on October 14, 1947, the USAF demonstrated its historic and ongoing commitment to technological innovation when Captain Charles "Chuck" Yeager piloted the X-1 developmental rocket plane to a speed of Mach 1.07, becoming the first flyer to break the sound barrier in a powered aircraft in level flight;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the USAF Reserve, created April 14, 1948, is comprised of Citizen Airmen who steadfastly sacrifice personal fortune and family comfort in order to serve as unrivaled wingmen of the active duty USAF in every deployment, mission, and battlefield around the globe;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the USAF operated the Berlin Airlift in 1948 and 1949 to provide humanitarian relief to post-war Germany and has established a tradition of humanitarian assistance in responding to natural disasters and needs across the world;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the USAF announced a policy of racial integration in the ranks of the USAF on April 26, 1948, 3 months prior to a Presidential mandate to integrate all military services;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in the early years of the Cold War, the USAF's arsenal of bombers, such as the long-range Convair B-58 Hustler and B-36 Peacemaker, and the Boeing B-47 Stratojet and B-52 Stratofortress, under the command of General Curtis LeMay served as the United States' preeminent deterrent against Soviet Union forces and were later augmented by the development and deployment of medium range and intercontinental ballistic missiles, such as the Titan and Minuteman developed by General Bernard A. Schriever;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the USAF, employing the first large-scale combat use of jet aircraft, helped to establish air superiority over the Korean peninsula, protected ground forces of the United Nations with close air support, and interdicted enemy reinforcements and supplies during the conflict in Korea;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas after the development of launch vehicles and orbital satellites, the mission of the USAF expanded into space and today provides exceptional real-time global communications, environmental monitoring, navigation, precision timing, missile warning, nuclear deterrence, and space surveillance;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas USAF Airmen have contributed to the manned space program of the United States since the program's inception and throughout the program's development at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration by dedicating themselves wholly to space exploration despite the risks of exploration;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the USAF engaged in a limited campaign of air power to assist the South Vietnamese government in countering the communist Viet Cong guerillas during the Vietnam War and fought to disrupt supply lines, halt enemy ground offensives, and protect United States and Allied forces;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Airmen were imprisoned and tortured during the Vietnam War and, in the valiant tradition of Airmen held captive in previous conflicts, continued serving the United States with honor and dignity under the most inhumane circumstances;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, in recent decades, the USAF and coalition partners of the United States have supported successful actions in Panama, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other locations around the globe;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Pacific Air Forces, along with Asia-Pacific partners of the United States, ensure peace and advance freedom from the west coast of the United States to the east coast of Africa and from the Arctic to the Antarctic, covering more than 100 million square miles and the homes of 2 billion people in 44 countries;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United States Air Forces in Europe, along with European partners of the United States, have shaped the history of Europe from World War II, the Cold War, Operation Deliberate Force, and Operation Allied Force to today's operations, and secured stability and ensured freedom's future in Europe, Africa, and Southwest Asia;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, for 17 consecutive years beginning with 1990, Airmen have been engaged in full-time combat operations ranging from Desert Shield to Iraqi Freedom, and have shown themselves to be an expeditionary air and space force of outstanding capability ready to fight and win wars of the United States when and where Airmen are called upon to do so;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the USAF is steadfast in its commitment to field a world-class, expeditionary air force by recruiting, training, and educating its Total Force of active duty, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, and civilian personnel;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the USAF is a trustworthy steward of resources, developing and applying technology, managing professional acquisition programs, and maintaining exacting test, evaluation, and sustainment criteria for all USAF weapon systems throughout such weapon systems' life cycles;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, when terrorists attacked the United States on September 11, 2001, USAF fighter and air refueling aircraft took to the skies to fly combat air patrols over major United States cities and protect families, friends, and neighbors of people of the United States from further attack;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on December 7, 2005, the USAF modified its mission statement to include flying and fighting in cyberspace and prioritized the development, maintenance, and sustainment of war fighting capabilities to deliver unrestricted access to cyberspace and defend the United States and its global interests;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Airmen around the world are committed to fighting and winning the Global War on Terror and have flown more than 430,000 sorties to precisely target and engage insurgents who attempt to violently disrupt rebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas talented and dedicated Airmen will meet the future challenges of an ever-changing world with strength and resolve;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the USAF, together with its joint partners, will continue to be the United States' leading edge in the ongoing fight to ensure the safety and security of the United States; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas during the past 60 years, the USAF has repeatedly proved its value to the Nation, fulfilling its critical role in national defense, and protecting peace, liberty, and freedom throughout the world: Now, therefore, be it</narrative>
  <narrative> Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That Congress remembers, honors, and commends the achievements of the United States Air Force in serving and defending the United States on the 60th anniversary of the creation of the United States Air Force as an independent military service.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400386" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 207, recognizing the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force as an independent military service. I thank my colleague from New Mexico, HEATHER WILSON, in particular, for her partnership and collaboration in helping to bring this bipartisan measure before the House. I want also to recognize the outstanding leadership of the cochairs of the Air Force Caucus, CLIFF STEARNS of Florida, SAM JOHNSON of  Texas, and JIM MARSHALL of Georgia for their participation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sixty years ago in July, President Truman and Congress distilled the lessons learned in World War II into landmark legislation known as the National Security Act of 1947. On September 18, the Armed Forces were reorganized under a Department of Defense, and the Air Force was established as a military department coequal to the Departments of the Army and the Navy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question of whether air forces should be a service on their own separate from the ground forces arose long before it was resolved in the National Security Act of 1947. Over a period of 40 years, airmen earned that recognition, beginning with the Aeronautical Division's earliest exploits in 1907, followed by the derring-do of the Army Air Service in World War I, and then by the superior performance of the Army Air Corps, later the Army Air Forces, in World War II. America's airmen performed  well; so well, in fact, that when battles were fought in the air, they were won decisively, making air superiority a standing assumption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This tradition started during World War II, with aviators like General Doolittle. During the war in North Africa and Europe, General Eisenhower and General Spaatz, as commander of the Army Air Forces, worked well together. General Eisenhower came to appreciate the capabilities of air power and the role of the Air Force in achieving victory. He called General Spaatz, "the best operational airman in the world," and became persuaded that the Air Force should exist alongside and equal to the Army  and the Navy. Ike compared this arrangement to a three-legged stool, where each leg is essential to the whole. It's a principle alive, well, and working today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its origin, the Air Force has stayed abreast of our national security requirements, adding missiles to aircraft, and through a long cold war, deterring any attack upon our country. The Air Force is typically called when we need to gain air superiority with troops and materiel, when and wherever the need arises. Its airlift and tanker capabilities give us the advantage of remote presence. Its satellites supply us with surveillance and communication capabilities that are the gold standard,  surpassing anything that any other country in the world possesses. Not only has the Air Force achieved a technical overmatch against our adversaries in the air, but in space and cyberspace as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In today's Air Force, over 700,000 "Total Force Airmen" are at work as we speak, exercising vigilance, reach, and power around the world. They are operating intelligence and reconnaissance aircraft and spacecraft, supplying early warning, real-time intelligence, and situational awareness to the war fighters on the ground. They are a critical presence in the battle space of Afghanistan and Iraq. They are lifting cargo and passengers, and using refueling assets to build air bridges, projecting  power, and sustaining the fight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the hardware tends to get the headlines, it is the people who make it work and who make the Air Force what it is. When General Horner came home from the Persian Gulf in 1991, I asked him who were the unsung heroes, and he answered without hesitation, "Well, for one, it is our NCOs; their quality has literally gone out of sight." I was reminded of what General Horner said when I was at Shaw Air Force Base not long ago and met with the Fighting 20th and its wing commander, Colonel Post,  along with airmen and women, many of them about to deploy. They will be part of some 35,000 other airmen deployed around the globe. Because of them and others like them, we have the best Air Force in the world, bar none.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This concurrent resolution is our way, as Members of Congress and citizens of this Nation, of expressing our appreciation, of recognizing the United States Air Force, its leaders and airmen, for consistently proving their worth to our Nation and helping make this the land of the free and the home of the brave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me conclude with the resolving clause: That Congress remembers, honors, and commends the achievements of the United States Air Force in serving and defending our country on the 60th anniversary of the creation of the United States Air Force as an independent military service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400411" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I represent the Third District of Ohio, which includes both the historic birthplace of aviation, home of the Wright brothers, as well as the home of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and I am honored to speak today in favor of <bill type="hc" number="207">H. Con. Res. 207</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill remembers, honors, and commends the achievements of the United States Air Force in serving and defending the United States on this 60th anniversary of the creation of the United States Air Force as an independent military service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to also recognize and thank my colleagues Mr. Spratt from South Carolina and Mrs. WILSON from New Mexico for their efforts in writing this bill and ushering it to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States Air Force is the largest modern Air Force in the world, with over 7,000 aircraft in service and about 358,600 men and women on active duty. The numerous airmen, technicians, and support staff through the years have served in the Air Force with honor, courage, and dignity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout history, the Air Force has adapted and designed new aircraft to meet the threats faced by the military, such as designing long-range bombers, more advanced tactical fighters, and eventually stealth aircraft. The humanitarian operations in Berlin after World War II, the Berlin Airlift, would not have happened was it not for the accuracy and dedication of the pilots of the Air Force. Today, the United States Air Force continues to be on the cutting edge of technology, pushing the envelope  of aircraft and pilot to new bounds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The F-22A and F-35 are the world's only fifth-generation fighters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize the 60th anniversary of the Air Force for its impact that it has had on my community of Dayton, Ohio. Wright Patterson Air Force Base in my district is the largest stand-alone base in the world, as well as being the home to the National Museum of the United States Air Force. Wright Pat has a strong tradition as a research and development hub, which started with Wright Pat when it was known as Huffman Prairie. Huffman Prairie is the location where the  Wright brothers developed the first practical airplane that was able to sustain flight. During the early years of flight, the Wright brothers used Huffman Prairie as a research and development facility. The tradition continues, as the research conducted at Wright Pat today will</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I am honored to recognize the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force and all of those who have served, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400386" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have a long list of cosponsors on this side of the aisle for this resolution, and I had a long list of potential speakers; but due to the rearrangement of resolutions, none is here now; and I would simply yield to the gentleman from Ohio so that he can further yield his time. And if you need further time on our side, we will be glad to grant it as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time, of course.</paragraph>
  </speaking>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to Dr. Gingrey of Georgia.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hc" number="207">H. Con. Res. 207</bill>, recognizing the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force as an independent military service, joining my colleague, the mayor of Dayton, and my colleague on the House Armed Services Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Americans may not realize that for the first 40 years of its existence, the United States Air Force was actually a department of the Army. It was not until President Harry Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947 that the Air Force became an independent military service and W. Stuart Symington became the first Secretary of the Air Force, later a United States Senator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1947, the Air Force has been an integral part of the United States military. Over the last 15 years the United States Air Force has been in continuous combat. Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm featured a full spectrum of Air Force capabilities. During the so-called "peacekeeping missions" in Somalia, Haiti and Kosovo, the Air Force contributed logistical and operational support and demonstrated its ability to achieve mission objectives without the use of ground forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Georgia's 11th Congressional District, Mr. Speaker, Dobbins Air Reserve Base has contributed to the success of the Air Force by providing key training of pilots and support personnel on both the C-130 and the C-5 platforms. In addition to Dobbins' training capabilities, FEMA's Federal Incident Response Team Atlanta is staged at Dobbins, and it mobilizes throughout the Southeast to disasters, both natural and manmade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dobbins also plays a role in the continued air dominance of the United States as the initial testing grounds for the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Never before has the United States' ability to project military power depended so heavily on air and space capabilities. Whether in a leading role or a support role, the United States Air Force has proved its unsurpassed airspace and cyberspace capabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to remember the importance of a strong national defense and certainly vote in favor of <bill type="hc" number="207">H. Con. Res. 207</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400386" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will continue to reserve my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400411" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to Mrs. Wilson of New Mexico.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400434" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the important thing about this resolution, to me, is that the Air Force and celebrating its anniversary is about the people who have served, those who've worn the uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1916, at the age of 17, my grandfather lied about his age and joined the Royal Flying Corps. He flew DH-7s and DH-9s and did sub search in the Irish Sea during World War I.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And after the First World War, there weren't many jobs to be had, so he came to America in 1922 and became a barnstormer in the early days of civil aviation, really the heyday of civil aviation, as new airplanes, new records, new payloads for speed and distance were being set across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In World War II, he towed targets and ferried parts and developed a system to Medivac soldiers out of the China, Burma, India theater of operations. Then it was B-72s and B-25s, P-38s and Corsairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1943, as a boy of 13, my father started taking flying lessons, traded them for time as a line boy down at the airport. And after World War II, and before Korea, my dad joined the Army Air Corps, which while he was in service became the United States Air Force. He was a crew chief at Walker Field in Roswell, New Mexico, taking care of, I think, F-86s at that time, although the hot plane was the F-100.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He left the Air Force and came home to be a commercial pilot. He taught my mom to fly. And in our 2-bedroom house we had three kids, two dogs, a den that was full of airplane.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1976, when I was a junior in high school, I was in my mother's bedroom when there was a television story on her little black and white portable TV that said that the Air Force Academy was opening its doors to women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, my grandfather had had two sons, five grandsons and me. I went to see him and told him I was thinking about maybe going to the Air Force Academy, and he said, well, I flew with some women in World War II and they were pretty good sticks, so I guess that'd be okay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My grandfather started to fly shortly after the Wright brothers first took to the air, and he lived to see a man walk on the Moon. It has been a remarkable century of aviation, and the Air Force has been part of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next year, after 33 years of service, active, Guard and Reserve, my husband will retire from the United States Air Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Generations have been inspired and protected by air warriors who broke the sound barrier, who tested rocket sleds, who trained as astronauts, who became aces and supported those who were, names we know like Billie Mitchell and Jimmy Doolittle, Lance Sijan, Hap Arnold, Bud Day, Clarence Kelly Johnson, and names we don't know of airmen and women called to serve and inspired by the thrill of flight.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400386" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in the interest of jointness, I have now the pleasure of recognizing and yielding 4 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Sestak), who is a retired naval admiral.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412232" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. This past weekend I had the opportunity with an 82-year-old airman to sit down with him and awarded him, after some work had been done, with the Distinguished Flying Cross. And he so proudly opened up his charts and the maps that he had flown over Europe back in World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as a Navy officer, I came to realize the quite close bond we had as he proudly then pointed to his log book and said, this was the ship, as they called their aircraft, that we were on during those missions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what I want to speak about is that wonderful passage in the book by Tom Wolf, "The Right Stuff." In it, as he talks about aviators, he spoke about how they take off and they fly, and often, particularly as the 50s, 60s and 70s occurred, they would often find themselves, all of a sudden, at some critical moment, where through their skill, their determination they managed to pull themselves out of a dangerous situation at the last yawing moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But then Tom Wolf went on and he said that's not really the key to these men and women. He said, then they took off again the next day and did the same thing, and the next day and the next day, and every day after that, just like clawing up a pyramid, never knowing each time whether they would or would not be able to pull it out at the last crying moment. That, Tom Wolf said, is the right stuff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I rise in commemoration of the Air Force and in a very joint way who has done so much for the security of our Nation. Without a question, they have the right stuff.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412191" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution and to honor the men and women of the United States Air Force who, today, celebrate 60 years of dedicated service. On a cold December day in 1903 in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, the Wright brothers achieved the world's first powered flight which lasted merely 59 seconds. Today our Air Force possesses an extraordinary global reach and even beyond into space thanks to the men and women who have served or are serving in the Air Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the United States Air Force has had a long and proud tradition of defending our Nation, as well as being a worldwide leader in aeronautical innovation. Since its early days, the Air Force has been in every military operation, from World War I to our present struggle in the global war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My father, who now is 88 years old, fought in World War II as part of what was then the Army Air Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to have the Air Force Academy, Schriever Air Force Base and Peterson Air Force Base all located in the 5th District of Colorado. Schriever Air Force Base is home to the 50th Space Wing, which is one of the world's best space command and control teams, delivering combat power from space for America and its allies. At Peterson Air Force Base, we have the 21st Space Wing, the Air Force's only organization providing missile warning and space control to commanders and combat forces worldwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Colorado Springs has the highly regarded United States Air Force Academy, whose mission is to educate, train and inspire men and women to become officers of character motivated to lead the United States Air Force in service to our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past 60 years, Mr. Speaker, the strength, preparedness, and innovative superior air power of the United States Air Force has helped ensure peace in the United States and throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the United States Air Force today and its airmen and -women for 60 years of service to our great Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 1/2  minutes to Mr. Stearns of Florida.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. STEARNS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400388" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. And as a former Air Force officer and veteran and one of the co-founders of the House of Representatives Air Force Caucus, I know firsthand how the Air Force provides our Nation a unique military advantage, obviously, indispensable in war and peace, to know what is happening around the globe, to lend a hand with humanitarian assistance, to deter nations that would use aggression to bully their neighbors, and to defend our Nation  when we are attacked and dealt a decisive blow to our foes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I bring to your attention, my colleagues, something that perhaps would not be talked about, that this supremacy could be threatened. And so I wish to, in this short amount of time talk about, although the Air Force has an overwhelming advantage right now, we are now at a point where a lot of the equipment is growing old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Air Force flies the oldest aircraft that we have ever had to support, and they will be getting older and more costly to maintain if nothing is done to reverse this trend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both our B-52s, our KC-135s average 46 years old today. In 2030 they'll be 68 years old. Our A-10s average 26 years old today. In 2030 they'll be almost 50 years old. Though the Air Force is the youngest service, it has the most to lose in the fight against complacency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Air Force is constantly in demand by combat commanders around the globe, but the size of our Air Force is the smallest it's ever been in decades. The Air Force had approximately 4,400 fighters in 1985. Today we have 2,500.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In 2030 it will have fewer than 1,400. Despite technological improvements, the Air Force cannot fulfill its global missions without sufficient force structure. Aircraft simply cannot be in two places at once, whether in Korea or Afghanistan or above New York City.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So for all of its immense accomplishments, the Air Force still faces formidable challenges as it enters the seventh year of the global war on terrorism. Losing our airpower edge is not a responsible option. We must ensure this does not happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, let me leave you with the words of one of the Air Force founders, Five-Star General Hap Arnold. His words still ring true today and are especially poignant as we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Our Air Force belongs to those who come from ranks of labor, management, the farms, the stores, the professions, and colleges and legislative halls ..... Air power will always be the business of every American citizen."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to honor and celebrate the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force. The Air Force is the world's dominant source of air and space power. America can rightly claim to be the greatest military power--a power that affords us prosperity and security. This status is due in no small part to our overwhelming supremacy in air and space. However, what is most impressive is the integrity and dedication of the men and women of the Air Force who work hard everyday to ensure air supremacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Air Force is the youngest of our Nation's military branches. It is able to adapt in time and space by changing position. The effects the Air Force can achieve through perspective, range and endurance are those no other military instrument can execute. Our Nation's ability to gain an advantage over our enemies by exploiting air and space is unsurpassed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The overwhelming advantages afforded to our Nation by the Air Force can be lost through inattention to modernization or by under-funding force structure. We are now at a point, after 17 years of continuous combat--from Desert Storm, Bosnia and Kosovo to Iraq and Afghanistan today--where our Nation's continued superiority in air and space is at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Air Force flies the oldest aircraft that we have ever had to support--and they will be getting older and more costly to maintain if nothing is done to reverse the trend. Both our B-52s and KC-135s average 46 years old today; in 2030, they will average 68 years old. Our A-10s average 26 years old today; in 2030, they will average 49 years old. Though the Air Force is the youngest service, it has the most to lose in the fight against complacency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Air Force is constantly in demand by combatant commanders around the globe but the size of our Air Force is the smallest it has been in decades. The Air Force had approximately 4,400 fighters in 1985, today we have around 2,500, and in 2030 it will have fewer than 1,400. Despite technological improvements, the Air Force cannot fulfill its global missions without sufficient force structure--aircraft simply cannot be in two places at once, whether in Korea and Afghanistan or above New York  City.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Never before has the Nation's ability to project military power depended so heavily on air and space capabilities. Whether it is the principal actor or a supporting force, the Air Force brings to the fight unsurpassed air, space, and cyberspace capabilities--adding strength, flexibility, and resilience to the joint force. In many cases, other U.S. military branches would not be able to carry out their missions without the Air Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much has changed over the years. The Air Force is flying unmanned aircraft over Iraq and Afghanistan controlled by airmen from bases in the United States and other remote locations around the world. Moreover, investments in air and space technologies have produced precision that would have been unimaginable even 15 years ago. Accuracy of weapons is now measured in mere feet from the target.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>From the days the sky was ruled by such pioneers of aviation as Eddie Rickenbacker and Hap Arnold, the United States Air Force has continued its commitment to fielding a world-class Air Force by recruiting, training, and educating its active duty, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, and civilian personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past 60 years, the United States Air Force has repeatedly proved its value to the Nation by fulfilling its critical role in national defense and protecting liberty and humanity throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 11, 2001, the United States Air Force fighters took to the skies to fly combat patrols over major U.S. cities to protect our loved ones  from further attack. Today, United States airmen continue their great service around the world to defend our liberties and freedoms in the global war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, Texas, a facility that's dedicated to training of intelligence specialists and firefighters.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my sincerest birthday wishes to an American institution that has helped provide freedom and liberty for all of us that we enjoy today, and that is the Department of Air Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was 60 years ago, following the passage of the National Security Act of 1947, that W. Stuart Symington was sworn in as the Nation's first Secretary of the Air Force, chosen to lead an organization finally given its rightful place in the brand new Department of Defense. The Air Force has gone on to become one of the steadfast defenders on high, enabling us to live in relative peace and tranquility knowing that they are always there literally keeping a watchful eye on our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its inception, the Department of the Air Force has been a global leader in perfecting and applying cutting-edge research and development. Whether it was the transition from the propeller to jet engines to the use of computer-aided weaponry incorporating satellite technology to today's use of unmanned aerial vehicles taking soldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen off the battlefield, the Air Force has always been the leader in the "Revolution in Military Affairs."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether it's patrolling the desert skies during Operation Northern Watch or deterring looming Iraqi aggression during Operation Vigilant Warrior, both in the 1990s, the men and women of the Air Force are constantly reminded that peace is not always peaceful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Providing a multitude of services to their fellow warriors on the ground, along with dominating the skies against our enemies, they have played a critical role in not only defending America's interests abroad but being ambassadors of goodwill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just ask the airmen who sit on constant alert in the Central Command ready to deliver relief aid, as they did last summer during the conflict between Lebanon and Israel, delivering more than 10 tons of food and supplies to the region. Foreign citizens and Americans alike were once again blessed by the humanitarian spirit of the Air Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I rise not just as a proud American but as a Member of Congress who is blessed with the good fortune of representing the brave men and women of the 7th Bomb Wing and the mighty C-130 Hercules of the 317th Airlift Group at Dyess Air Force Base. Just last week I met with several of them before they deployed overseas, and I was swept away by their overwhelming courage and resounding spirit. Americans know that when airmen put on their flight suits, they are not just putting it on for themselves  but for all Americans. They do it for others and they continue to do it so we can all live freely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the relatively short time the Air Force has been in existence, its contributions to America's security have been historic. America owes the United States Air Force a debt of gratitude for all that they have given us and will continue to give us, without fear or hesitation. They are always the backbone of our projected forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish them a very happy 60th birthday and best wishes for another successful 60 years.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when the Wright brothers first accomplished flight, when they stretched out the wings of their airplane and began to fly and then returned to continue their work at Huffman Prairie in Dayton, Ohio, which later became Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, they could not have known the importance of their invention to preserving our freedoms and to preserving liberty. But they could imagine the bravery of the pilots that were to follow.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hc" number="207">H. Con. Res. 207</bill>, a resolution recognizing the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force as an independent military service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored that Edwards Air Force Base, home of the Air Force Flight Test Center, is located in my district, the 22nd District of California. I rise today to honor the men and women of the United States Air Force, especially those who have spent part or all of their careers in the pursuit of cutting edge flight technology at Edwards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The USAF was "born" in 1947, but as we all know, our military's efforts to explore air power began in the early part of the 20th century with the Wright Military Flyer. The area now known as Edwards joined the effort in 1933, when LTC Henry H. "Hap" Arnold of the Army Air Corps selected a site on the edge of Rogers Dry Lake for a bombing and gunnery range at a place called Muroc, a reversal of the last name of the Corum family, which had settled in the area in 1910.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After World War II, Muroc Army Air Field was alive with activity on the X-plane programs, resulting in great successes such as the Bell X-1, which broke the sound barrier on October 14, 1947, with Chuck Yeager at the controls. The base was renamed in 1949 after CPT Glen Edwards, who died in a crash of the YB-49, and the Air Force Flight Test Center was activated in 1951, the same year that the Air Force moved its test pilot school to Edwards. In the 1960s, the X-15 broke record after record for  speed and altitude. Over the years, the Flight Test Center has tested and supported the development of virtually every aircraft system that has entered the Air Force inventory and has been involved in more major milestones in flight than any other comparable organization in the world. It has been on the cutting edge of every major development that has transformed the field of flight, from the first American jet plane to the current system-of-systems revolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a pleasure to recognize and honor the hard work of the men and women of our United States Air Force on their 60th anniversary, although each day we should remember those who sacrifice in defense of our country. As the Air Force moves forward from its 60th year, we can look to the motto of the Air Force Flight Test Test Center--"Ad Inexplorat ..... Toward the Unexplored."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to express my support for this resolution recognizing the 60th Anniversary of the U.S. Air Force as an independent military service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Offutt Air Force Base is home to the 55th Wing, the Fightin' Fifty-Fifth. Offutt's diverse missions and global responsibilities put it on the cutting edge of the new U.S. Air Force. There are approximately 12,000 military and Federal employees representing all branches of the military that serve on or near Offutt AFB, which is located near the Missouri River just south of Omaha and is a major presence in my congressional district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Offut is also the home of STRATCOM, the global integrated force that is charged with the missions of space operations; information operations; integrated missile defense; global command and control; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; global strike; and strategic deterrence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Fifty-Fifth Wing operates a variety of aircraft to conduct operations from Offutt AFB, Nebraska; Kadena AB, Japan; RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom; Souda Bay Naval Support Activity, Crete; and other locations around the world. It is the largest wing in Air Combat Command and the second largest in the Air Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Air Combat Command is the principal provider of combat airpower that supports America's global national security strategy. It operates fighter, bomber, reconnaissance, battle-management and electronic-combat aircraft. It also provides command, control, communications, intelligence systems, and information operations in support of the war on terror in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a cosponsor of <bill type="hc" number="207">H. Con. Res. 207</bill>--Recognizing the 60th Anniversary of the U.S. Air Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to represent the men, women, and families that make up Travis Air Force  Base in Fairfield, California. They are the service men and women who represent "The Gateway to the West," and oversee more cargo and passenger traffic on its runways than any other military air terminal in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To me, they represent what is best about our Air Force and its proud history. Travis airmen are constantly being called upon to provide critical service to our Nation. Along with their Air Force colleagues across the globe they continue to play a vital role in the global war on terror as well as Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only do they put their lives on the line in military missions whenever called upon, but the men and women of Travis have provided humanitarian relief across the globe as recently as the Indonesian tsunami and right here at home in response to the hurricane Katrina disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The service members of Travis carry out their missions and protect the homeland because they have the right airlift platforms--the C-5s and the C-17s--to do their job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, I was able to secure $10.8 million for the Global Support Squadron Facility at Travis Air Force Base in the fiscal year 2008 Military Construction Appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This project would provide a cutting edge operations facility to house approximately 130 personnel necessary for the first Global Support Squadron Facility on the West Coast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would enhance readiness through specialized design features for command and control, training and deployment preparation, not available in current facilities. GSS is critical to the Air Force's ability to rapidly deploy U.S. military forces and initiate operations in minimal time at any base or location around the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 60th Air Mobility Wing at Travis is the largest air mobility organization in the Air Force with a versatile all-jet fleet of C-5 Galaxy, C-17 Globemaster III cargo aircraft, and KC-10 Extender refueling aircraft. It handles more cargo and passengers than any other military air terminal in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Travis is the West Coast terminal for aeromedical evacuation aircraft returning sick or injured patients from the Pacific area. The 60th Air Mobility Wing crews can fly support missions anywhere in the world to fulfill its motto of being "America's First Choice" for providing true global reach.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, since the United States Air Force was established as an independent branch of the U.S. Armed Forces in 1947, it has played a major role in our national defense. Throughout its 60 years of valiant service, from Operation Rolling Thunder over the skies of Southeast Asia, to Operations Northern and Southern Watch in Iraq, the men and women of the United States Air Force and Air National Guard have defended the United States and our allies around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1947, the men and women stationed at McChord Air Force Base in Washington state have played a key role in supporting the mission of the Air Force, and I want to acknowledge their outstanding service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Team McChord," which includes the 62nd Airlift Wing, and its Air Force Reserve components in the 446th Airlift Wing, has flown continuous combat airlift operations every day since October 2001. These operations provide vital airlift and medical evacuation support to our forces as they fight to stop the spread of terrorism and as they respond to other contingencies. In addition to being the home of combat airlift, "Team McChord" includes the Western Air Defense Sector, the 22nd Special Tactics  Squadron, and the 262nd Information Warfare Aggressor Squadron. Together, day in and day out, these brave men and women actively support vital military operations around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we recognize the continued dedication of the United States Air Force. I congratulate them on 60 years of invaluable service to our county.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, I want to pay tribute to the United States Air Force, on the occasion of its sixtieth anniversary. This special day provides us with an important opportunity to recognize and honor the men and women who have made our Nation's Air Force the greatest air power in the world. As a former Captain in the U.S. Air Force myself, I shared a willingness to protect and defend the United States of America with all my fellow airmen and airwomen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 18, 1947, the National Security Act of 1947 was enacted, and the U.S. Air Force was officially formed. Although it is the newest unit of the four military branches, the U.S. Air Force has rapidly evolved into a segment of our armed services that embodies the fundamental core values and aptitude of our Nation's military foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the fifth century B.C., Chinese military theorist Sun Tzu said that the "The art of employing troops is that when the enemy occupies high ground, do not confront him." Drawing on the teachings of Sun Tzu and nineteenth century military historian and theorist Carl von Clausewitz, military leaders over the past 200 years have sought to perfect their craft in warfare. Until the 20th century, however, the might of a country's military forces was still incomplete. While nation-states throughout  the world had successfully developed their ground and sea forces, it was not until the advent of aircraft that the nature of warfare would be altered dramatically and permanently, thus finally permitting our armed services to confront the enemy on high ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Still, it took time to develop the technology and practice of air power so that it matched its theoretical potential. Even though the technology for capable air power existed for the U.S. Air Force during the Vietnam and Korean wars, the United States had not developed the capability of air power thoroughly enough to derive full benefit from its use until the Gulf War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Retired U.S. Air Force Colonel John Warden, the initial architect of the gulf war's air campaign, "Instant Thunder," once theorized that the most important effect that air power would have in war would be its ability to destabilize the will and morale of the enemy's military leadership. The use of American air power in the gulf war and Operation Iraqi Freedom successfully proved Colonel Warden's theory true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Air Force is unmatched in its technological prowess, providing air and space superiority on demand, and playing an important role in America's nuclear deterrence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Air Force is revolutionary in that it is an expeditionary air force: It gets our ground forces to the fight, and gets our air power in the fight. Our Nation's Air Force has essentially provided our ground and naval forces with the tools necessary to successfully fight asymmetrical warfare by turning the landscape into a symmetrical one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Great Narrative of the next 25 years will be the contest between globalization and parochialism. As communications and technology continue to flatten the world, the connected first-world nations will benefit and their vested interest in the global order's continued smooth functioning will encourage political stability and economic development. Those nations left behind will see globalization as a hostile force and may fight against it. It is those same countries that also tend to serve as  fertile breeding grounds for radical ideologies. The challenge ahead lies in folding these countries into the new global order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The battle we face today in the global war on terror is the same battle we will face tomorrow, and it is a war we will continue to fight throughout our lifetime. In some ways, this war is not unlike the cold war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union; a monumental surgical strike will not immediately and forever decimate the enemy. This war will take time, and will require the prolonged use of a clear, inclusive, and engaging national military strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, our armed services continue to focus on "muddy boots" requirements in Iraq and Afghanistan. We must remember that this would not be possible without the work of our Nation's Air force. In the initial stages of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the U.S. Air Force paved the way for our men and women on the ground so that they could conduct military to-military training, counter-drug, counter-terrorist, and homeland defense missions in Operation Enduring Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that as we celebrate the sixtieth birthday of the United States Air Force, we will be reminded of the tremendous sacrifices that our Air Force personnel and their families have made throughout the history of air power so that we may all continue to enjoy and pursue the opportunities afforded us by their significant role in protecting our democratic values. We must encourage innovation in the field, and I will do my part to ensure that our Air Force will be ready to meet the future  with the tools they need to capitalize on new technologies, to maximize transport of equipment and military personnel, and to provide our boots on the ground with the landscape necessary to continue to deter, prevent, and punish acts of terrorism and piracy in the U.S. and around the world.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 207 recognizing the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force. Sixty years ago today, the National Security Act of 1947 established what we know as the premiere Air Force in the world. Since that time, thousands of airmen have served our Nation with pride and honor, and I am proud to recognize their service today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mission of the U.S. Air Force is to deliver sovereign options for the defense of the United States of America and its global interests--to fly and fight in air, space, and cyberspace. Air Force aircraft, tankers, and cargo planes play key roles in nearly every combat operation our Nation undertakes. Additionally, their capabilities in space have become critical to air, land, and sea combat operations and are a benefit to our entire Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past 60 years, Air Force aircraft, missiles, and satellites have kept our Nation safe. While the many technologies and advancements have certainly contributed to our national defense, it is the most prized resource of the Air Force--its airmen--that truly make a difference for our Nation and the world. As a member of the Air Force Caucus, I am pleased to recognize the service of both current and former Air Force personnel on this 60th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we consider this resolution, our Nation's airmen are serving in every corner of the world, including many in Alabama's Second Congressional District. I am proud to represent Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base, home of Air University, along with the 42nd Air Base Wing, the Operations and Sustainment Support Group, the 908th Airlift Wing, the 754th Electronic Systems Group, the Air Force Logistics Management Agency, and the newest squadron in the Air Force, the 100th Fighter Squadron. The 100th Fighter  Squadron is special because it was the squadron of the famed Tuskegee Airmen during World War II, and I am pleased that this squadron will call Montgomery home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Air University is a major component of Air Education and Training Command and is the Air Force's center for professional military education. Air University provides the full spectrum of Air Force education, from pre-commissioning to the highest levels of professional military education, including degree granting and professional continuing education for officers, enlisted and civilian personnel throughout their careers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Air University's Professional Military Education programs educate airmen on the capabilities of air and space power and its role in national security. These programs focus on the knowledge and abilities needed to develop, employ, command, and support air and space power at the highest levels. Additionally, Air University conducts research in air  and space power, education, leadership, and management and contributes to the development and testing of Air Force doctrine, concepts and strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year the Air Force also celebrates the 25th birthday of Air Force Space Command. As Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I am privileged to work with some of the finest in the Air Force on a set of programs that I believe will only become more important to our future security. Our world is becoming increasingly dependent on assets and platforms in space, and America's Air Force is meeting the challenges of the 21st Century security environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the cold war, Air Force U-2 reconnaissance aircraft kept us safe by keeping watch on the Soviets. I am proud to note that I served as an Intelligence Analyst supporting this platform from 1955-1959 in West Germany. These aircraft performed a number of critically important missions and made a vital contribution to our National defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Air and missile crews manning nuclear bombers and ICBMs provided our Nation with a powerful strategic deterrent. These capabilities were a major component of our "Peace Through Strength" policy that enabled the United States to win the cold war, and I think it is appropriate for Congress to recognize the dedicated service of countless numbers of airmen who protected our Nation during this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Air Force ushers in its next 60 years, we can be assured it will be postured to meet new challenges in air, space, and cyberspace. As a member of the Air Force Caucus, I am proud to provide for the needs of current and future force. Although the service is the youngest of the branches of our Armed Forces, there is no question that the Air Force has made, is making, and will continue to make an extraordinary contribution to our nation's defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a nation, we are indebted to the Air Force for its commitment and sacrifice. I congratulate Secretary Wynne, General Moseley, and the entire Air Force team for 60 years of dedicated service and defense of our freedom.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 60 years ago President Harry Truman, through the National Security Act of 1947, created the United States Air Force and ended a 40-year association with the U.S. Army. This move signaled the dawning of a new age and placed airpower in its proper place as a vital element of our Nation's defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Airpower had proven its worth to President Truman and many others over those 40 years. From Military Air Balloon success in World War I, to Billy Mitchell's airpower demonstration off Virginia's coast, to the Doolittle Raids and the devastating bombing raids in World War II, airpower allowed our military commanders to fight for and defend our Nation as never before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Creating a separate Air Force allowed our brave service men and women to fully concentrate on honing the skills and pushing the ever-expanding envelope of airpower.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Georgia today, we have Air National Guard and/or Air Force Reserve units at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Robins Air Force Base, Savannah, Macon and Brunswick as well as active-duty units at Moody Air Force Base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And whether it is C-130s from the 165th Airlift Wing or men and women from the 117th Air Control Squadron which just won the 2007 Outstanding Air Control Squadron award from the National Guard Association of the United States, each of Georgia's units and the outstanding men and women who serve in them contribute around the world fighting the Global War on Terrorism. They also provide a formidable force in the face of disaster here at home, as was seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina when  rescue helicopters from Moody teamed up with other Air Force rescue units to save more than 4,300 people from the disastrous and deadly storm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dobbins, Robins and Moody can all trace their beginnings to the Army and the 1940-1941 timeframe when the War Department was making preparations in case the United States went to war--which came to fruition on December 7, 1941 when the Japanese declared War on the United States and attacked Pearl Harbor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dobbins began as Rickenbacker Field, but was re-named in 1950 in honor of Captain Charles M. Dobbins of Marietta, whose airplane was shot down during the war near Sicily.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Robins is named after Brigadier General Augustine Warner Robins, one of the Army Air Corps' first General Staff Officers. The Warner Robins Air Logistic Center which preceded the base is also named after the General.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moody is named after MAJ George Putnam Moody, an early Air Force pioneer killed in May 1941 while serving with the Beech Aircraft Company in Wichita, Kan. At the time of his death, the major was working on the inspection board for AT-10 transitional trainers which were later sent to Moody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While each base has a rich history, Moody began a new chapter in its history just recently when the 23rd Fighter Group relocated to Moody and began flying A-10 missions in the skies over Valdosta.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 23rd Fighter Group also known as the "Flying Tigers" was formed under the command of General Claire Chennault and was part of his China Air Task Force, taking over the mission of the disbanded American volunteer group "Flying Tigers." Several of the original Flying Tigers flew with the 23rd Fighter Group in the China-Burma-India Theater, passing on their knowledge and experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like Mitchell before him, Chennault was another early pioneer and controversial figure who made today's Air Force possible. He argued vehemently for the fighter plane in the 1930s--a time when the rise of the bomber aircraft had consumed the Air Corps experts and were the focus for their tactics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, it was his continued belief and passionate advocacy for the fighter that led to his isolation at the famed Air Tactical School and eventually drove him to become an advisor in China and the rest as we say is history.</paragraph>
