    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in 7 years, the President has been awfully reluctant to use his veto pen. But when it comes to important health care legislation, this President hasn't hesitated to say "no" to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stem cell research, which could cure diseases and save millions of lives, the American people support it. The President vetoed it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Children's health insurance provides health care to children from working middle-class families who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but can't afford private insurance. The American people support it. This President vetoed it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district, Dolores Sweeney works for an insurance company, has three children, and is trying to get private health care for her children, but cannot get it in the private insurance marketplace. Her employer does not provide health care. Her children are on SCHIP. This bill is right for Dolores Sweeney and the 10 million children that get health care through it. The President vetoed it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even Republican Senator CHARLES GRASSLEY said about the President and SCHIP, He simply doesn't understand the bill and he is wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only health care legislation this President supported was a prescription  drug bill which gave billions of dollars away to the special interests. It is time for the President to stand with the American people and support our children.</paragraph>
