    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am loath to close the proceedings on this very special day when such a special milestone has been achieved by a very special man, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, whom I am privileged to count as a colleague. But toil we must.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.</paragraph>
