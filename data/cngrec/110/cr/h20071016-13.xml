  <narrative>HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE TWO CHIP PLANS BEFORE THEM--THEY HAVE TO DECIDE THIS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11552]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412186" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this week, Republicans must decide if they're going to support a bipartisan bill that provides health care for 4 million more children or if they're going to back a Bush administration plan that will leave 800,000 more children uninsured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the Children's Health Insurance Program ensures that 6 million children have access to private health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, President Bush proposed increasing CHIP funding by $5 billion over the next 5 years. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office concluded that this plan will result in 800,000 children losing their health coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's proposal is unacceptable to many of us. Our bipartisan compromise bill allows us not only to insure all the children currently in this program, but also allows us to cover an additional 4 million children who are already eligible but not enrolled in CHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, House Republicans have a decision to make. I hope they stand up for 10 million children to help us override the President's veto.</paragraph>
