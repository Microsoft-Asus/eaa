  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the importance of providing access to a quality education is one of our most important goals as a nation, as our children and grandchildren compete in an ever increasingly complex workplace. Those who dedicate their lives to this mission have chosen one of the most rewarding and satisfying life paths. For 29 years, Dr. Albert Lorenzo served as president of Macomb Community College, skillfully charting a course that has greatly benefitted not only those who have been  directly affiliated with the college, but also the surrounding community. His commitment to educating students has transformed countless lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>July 1, 2008, marked the end of an era for one of Michigan's premier educational institutions, Macomb Community College, and the end of a richly rewarding journey for Dr. Lorenzo. I, along with my Michigan colleague, Senator Stabenow, would like to sincerely thank him for a job well done and for making such a significant contribution to the lives of the people of Macomb County and the State of Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Lorenzo was installed as the fourth president of Macomb Community College in July 1979 and navigated the college through significant transition and growth. Upon his retirement, he was the longest-serving community college president in Michigan. Under his leadership, Macomb Community College began offering classes leading to various bachelor degrees in 1991, filling an important void in the community. Dr. Lorenzo is also credited with creating the first ever university center model, which  is now used in community colleges throughout the country. Macomb's University Center facilitates partnerships with eight universities and institutions, working to bring higher educational opportunities to this underserved community in Michigan. The college is flourishing, with an enrollment of approximately 27,000 students and with three out of every four Macomb County college students beginning their college careers at MCC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his commitment and success at MCC, Dr. Lorenzo has been a leading member of the Macomb community. Over the years, he has been active on several corporate boards and policy commissions, has worked with several national advisory groups and has been appointed by both Governor Engler and Governor Granholm to economic advisory boards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al Lorenzo has also been recognized nationally for his many publications and has been awarded 12 major leadership awards, as well as 2 honorary doctoral degrees. He has received numerous other commendations, including the Tom Peters Leadership Award, and the March of Dimes Citizen of the Year Award. Additionally, he was named President of the Year by three national associations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al will be devoting the next chapter of his life to solving the economic and educational challenges that face Macomb County and Michigan by working with Oakland University as they expand their services in Macomb County. We know our colleagues in the Senate join us in recognizing Dr. Al Lorenzo, his wife Katherine, and their family on his retirement. He has left an enduring mark on the educational landscape in Michigan, and we wish him many more years of service and success as he begins this new  endeavor.</paragraph>
