  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="REMEMBERING JOHN MOSES">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I honor the memory of a man who served the State of Wisconsin, and its veterans, with great skill and dedication for more than two decades. John  Moses served as secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs from 1962 to 1984. I had the great pleasure of knowing John personally, and having him serve as a member of my Veterans' Advisory Committee. I saw firsthand how committed he was to ensuring that  Wisconsin's veterans, who have given so much to our country, get the care and services they deserve in return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, John was a veteran himself, who bravely served in World War II. He came under attack twice as part of an antiaircraft unit in the Aleutian Islands, and later, in the European theater, led the point platoon in General Patton's drive across the Moselle River to Siegfried line. He also survived a severe wound he received in combat on the German border, which put him in the hospital for more than a year. John's heroic military service said volumes about the kind of man he was and how devoted  he was to serving our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Service of every kind defined John's life, from his time in the U.S. military to his tenure at the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs, and through other efforts, such as his 10 years as president of the Gays Mills School Board. John came from a tradition of public service; his father was Governor of North Dakota, and he was then elected to the Senate. He briefly served in this body before he passed away in 1945.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Moses was a man of outstanding character and uncommon commitment to both his State and his country. I feel fortunate to have known him, and I know that the State of Wisconsin is a better place for his dedicated efforts. That is a lasting legacy and one to which I am proud to pay tribute today.</paragraph>
