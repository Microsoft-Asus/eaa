  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I was unable to cast a vote on Friday, September 21, on amendment No. 2898 to the Defense authorization bill. I have voted against similar measures in the past, and had I been available to vote on Friday, I would have again voted against this attempt to direct a precipitous withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The terms of this amendment would have required U.S. troops to begin leaving Iraq within 90 days of the Defense authorization bill's enactment and complete that withdrawal within 9 months. While I understand public frustration with the war, I believe a precipitous and arbitrary withdrawal mandated by Congress is not a wise solution to the situation in Iraq. I cannot support attempts to set an arbitrary deadline for withdrawing our forces from Iraq, which endangers our troops, our safety at home  and the overall stability of Iraq and the Middle East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe our military commanders should determine how and when our troops begin leaving Iraq based on conditions on the ground. General Petraeus announced this month that he would be able to begin withdrawing U.S. forces from Iraq. I believe Congress should rely on the guidance and leadership of General Petraeus and our other commanders on the ground to determine how best to eventually bring our troops home from Iraq.</paragraph>
