    <paragraph>Madam President, today I wish to celebrate the Quilts of Valor Foundation. In a time when thousands of American families are sending their loved ones around the world to fight for the safety and security of all of us here at home, the Quilts of Valor Foundation has stepped forward to give something back to our wounded heroes. This foundation has pledged to sew and donate a Quilt of Valor to every servicemember wounded in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Their mission is to offer comfort  and support to our wounded heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An organization not about politics, but about people, the Quilts of Valor Foundation was established in November 2003 by Catherine Roberts of Seaford, DE, Since that time, thousands of volunteers from all over the United States have created over 13,000 quilts for our injured service men and women. With the help of military chaplains at medical centers throughout the United States, Europe and in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Quilts of Valor Foundation locates wounded soldiers and presents them with  a hand-made quilt. That quilt is a symbol of the respect and honor that we as a country hold for them and their sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The organization has two main missions which frame their important service to our country. First and foremost, the Quilts of Valor Foundation is dedicated to honoring those men and women who have been wounded, whether physically or psychologically, in Iraq and Afghanistan with a Quilt of Valor. Second, the Quilts of Valor Foundation hopes that by teaching young people to quilt and by spreading a culture of volunteerism, a new generation of Americans will become more civically involved and dedicated  to bettering our Nation in whatever way they can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to acknowledge and sincerely thank Catherine Roberts, the Quilts of Valor Foundation, and all the volunteers, especially those in Delaware, who put so much time, money, effort, and love into every quilt to comfort our servicemembers and let them know how much we at home value their sacrifices.</paragraph>
