    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am gratified that at long last the Senate is acting to keep the alternative minimum tax from hitting 19 million more American taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We tried to save those 19 million families from AMT on November 15, when the majority leader asked the Senate to do so. We tried to save those 19 million families from the AMT on repeated occasions this week. Most recently, today we tried to save those 19 million families from the AMT by moving to the House-passed bill. When the other side blocked us, we tried to save those 19 million families from the AMT by asking consent to pass the legislation that we have before us now. But at every step,  the Republican caucus objected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am gratified that at long last the Republican caucus has agreed to let us act. Perhaps the third time is the charm--or the fourth or the fifth. In any event, here we are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will support this effort to save those 19 million families from the AMT. The bill before us is plainly not my first choice of how to do so, but this is our best choice to do so. Let me once again remind people why we need to act. That is, we need to act because if we do not, nearly 12 million families with incomes between $100,000 and $200,000 will pay the AMT next year. We need to act because if we don't, 5 million families with incomes between $75,000 and $100,000 will pay the AMT next year.  We need to act because if we don't, remarkably, nearly 2 1/2  million families with incomes of less than $75,000 will have to pay the AMT next year. We need to stop that from happening. We need to keep the AMT from hitting any more families than it already does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am obviously very pleased that the Senate has finally come to the point of voting on something in 2007 to take care of the alternative minimum tax problem. I would rather have gone through this process several months ago but better late than never.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the course of this year, I have given 12 Senate floor speeches analyzing the alternative minimum tax and describing the problem it poses for middle-class taxpayers, and I have done that in great detail. As I said so many times--before, hoping, and now I am glad to say the Senate Democratic leadership seems to realize--the AMT should not be offset.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also wish to thank my good friend, Chairman Baucus, for all of his hard work this year and for several years to protect middle-income taxpayers from the AMT. Chairman Baucus did our country a great service by pushing for this compromise that can garner, we hope, the support of Democrats and Republicans. Although we did not mark up in committee, Chairman Baucus rolled up his sleeves and got to work to find a middle ground. That middle ground is before us. He has consistently  avoided bitter partisanship and always worked to do the right thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tonight, I ask my friends in the House Democratic leadership, assuming we get the votes to pass this product before us, to follow the example of Chairman Baucus and the Senate Democratic leadership and finish this job to give the assurance that is necessary to these 23 million taxpayers that they are not going to be hit by a tax they were never expected to pay in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone has thus far made partisan points. That episode must cease. Those obsessed with their tax-increase-biased version of pay-go must turn now to the people's business. Those who want to raise more taxes to pay for a tax that was never meant to raise revenue from the middle class have made their points. The record is clear. My friends in the House Democratic leadership need to cease punishing the 23 million middle-income taxpayers with a pay-go obsession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my friends in the House Democratic leadership, we can talk until we are blue in the face. The bottom line is we need to change the tax laws with respect to AMT. That law change needs congressional action and Presidential signature. Anything else is just plain talk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night, I suggested a path to get all parties to an agreement on changing the law on the AMT patch. By "all parties," I am referring to House Democrats, House Republicans, Senate Democrats, Senate Republicans, and I have to include the President because without an agreement we will not get a law, and a law has to be signed. Without a law change, 23 million families face an unexpected tax increase that we think will be about $2,000 per family. Without a rapid law change, we make things even  worse during filing season. We are going to have a fiasco of another 27 million families and individual taxpayers hurt, waiting for a refund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reiterate my suggestion tonight. It is in a letter from Chairman Rangel, Chairman Baucus, Ranking Member McCrery, and myself. That letter, dated October 31 this year, contains the tests that ought to be applied to any proposal in substance or process on the AMT patch legislation. Here is one sentence, "We"--the four of us:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We plan to do everything possible to enact AMT relief legislation in a form mutually agreeable to the Congress and the President before the end of the year.&lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Baucus and the Senate Democratic leadership are trying to meet this test with this agreement which is before us now. Now the Democratic leadership in the House needs to follow through. We Senators hopefully will pass this package that is agreeable to the President and the House. What do we all agree on? We agree the patch needs to get done, so that is the base of what will pass the Senate, we hope. If House Democrats continue to insist on offsets for a patch--we hope that doesn't  happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President and congressional Republicans disagree with the Democrats on the need for offsets. Offsets for the patch are not mutually agreeable, as the letter we sent implies. They fail the tax writer's test. On extenders, the House wants 1 year, the Senate wants 2 years. President Bush had 1 year in his budget. Maybe 2 years might be mutually agreeable. On this point, offsets are not mutually agreeable. But it looks as if we will defer on next year's extenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this year's AMT patch, we need to make law. To make law, the proposals must be mutually agreeable. The only proposal that is mutually agreeable is an unoffset AMT patch. Let's get to the law change and end the AMT patch dilemma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the House Democratic leadership to pass the AMT patch bill and send it to the President. It is in a form the President will sign. We must change the law now. We owe it to the 23 million families who could be hit by the AMT. We owe it to the additional 27 million families and individuals who face delayed refunds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great reluctance that I plan to oppose the AMT bill before us. While I strongly support providing AMT relief to middle-class taxpayers, I simply cannot support an AMT patch that is not paid for. Let's be clear on what we are doing here today: we are voting on a bill that will require us to increase our deficit by $50 billion. Our children and grandchildren will have to pay  back the funds we are borrowing today,  with interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many ways we could have been responsible and paid for this measure, but the President of the United States and the Republican Congress have refused to consider them. One option in a bill that I introduced would have paid for this AMT relief by increasing the taxes on investment profits for millionaires, many of whom enjoy an unjust tax benefit that allows them to pay a lower tax rate than struggling middle-class families. Under my proposal, a small number of taxpayers with incomes over</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President of the United States and the Republicans in Congress believe that borrowing money from foreign nations, for our children to repay, is the best way to finance our government. I do not, and therefore I must oppose this measure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Montana for bringing the bill to the floor. Earlier in the day, we had a discussion about the underlying bill, which is the bill that came over from the House, and the reservations I had about this, specifically the fact that it raises taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It raises them in an inappropriate way, in a way, in my opinion, which would chill economic expansion in this country, would undermine our ability to create capital in this country and, as a result, would undermine the ability of entrepreneurs to go out and create jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would have the effect of exporting jobs offshore, as a practical matter in the financial markets and, unfortunately, would probably have an equally detrimental effect of encouraging places such as London to become even more aggressive as they compete for our capital formation activity, which has always historically occurred in New York City, which plays a large role in the energy of our Nation's economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the underlying bill has serious problems as it came over from the House. It also had a specific earmark to basically benefit essentially 290 people who are using the Virgin Islands as a tax shelter. It had another specific earmark to benefit State legislators who would get a per diem for not even showing up at their State legislature. It was a very poor bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposal as brought forward from the Senator from Montana is an excellent approach: Let's take care of the AMT for next year. Let's move on. Let's do this quickly so the people who are being subject to this or may be brought into this improperly, who were never supposed to be brought into this, can be relieved of that burden.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, there is the issue of whether there should be an offset. Well, of course, there should not be an offset. Looking at it from a budgeteer's standpoint, in my opinion, these are all phantom funds. We basically know the alternative minimum tax is not going to generate these revenues that we score as coming in because we know the AMT was never intended to tax 26 million Americans or 20 million Americans. We know that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But because of the rules, the arcane rules we have around here for budgeting, we basically have to include those revenues in this baseline, even though we know we are never going to tax people at those levels because it would be totally unfair and inappropriate. So I congratulate the Senator from Montana and the Senator from Iowa for coming forward with this approach to resolve this matter. I look forward to voting for the proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Chairman of the Finance Committee. I thank him for his leadership and the leadership of the Senator from Iowa in attempting to address the problem we confront.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today as chairman of the Budget Committee in direct contradiction of my colleague on the other side to say: When nobody anticipated using these revenues: Really?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How it is then that all this money was in the President's budget? All this money was in every budget printed by Republicans and Democrats. The only way any of these budgets balance is with this revenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I would acknowledge it makes absolutely no sense to tax these people with the alternative minimum tax. It was never adjusted for inflation. That would not be a fair outcome. But it ought to be paid for. The revenue ought to be replaced, either by spending cuts or by other revenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because if we do not pay for it, we are going to borrow it. Where are we going to borrow it? Well, we are going to borrow about half of it from abroad, most of it from the Chinese and the Japanese.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So while I very much recognize the difficult situation we are in, and I applaud the chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member for grappling this, with trying to find a way to handle this problem, I cannot support providing this measure without it being paid for. That is what pay-go is about, to require that any new spending or new tax cuts or other revenue changes be offset. If we do not do it, we have to borrow it. We increasingly have to borrow it from abroad. That is not a wise  course to pursue. Again, I recognize the extremely difficult situation we are in because some will resist doing anything other than allowing AMT to be eliminated for this 1 year without an offset.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, personally, think that is a mistake. I think it is a mistake for the country. I think that money ought to be replaced, it ought to be offset. Again, when people say: Well, nobody ever anticipated this revenue, that is not the case. Everybody who wrote a budget around here anticipated it. Every single budget, including the President's, including every budget written by Republicans or Democrats, included this revenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While it would be a serious mistake to allow the AMT to go forward and hit 23 million American families, I believe the answer is to pay for it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have a number of Senators because of the bad  weather who are caught in traffic. I have two alternatives. One is when time is up, go into a quorum call. What I would like to do, because I know other people want to get the vote over and leave, what I would like to do, is let everyone know I would drag the vote.
