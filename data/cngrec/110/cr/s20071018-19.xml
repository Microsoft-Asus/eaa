  <speaking speaker="300010" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today our friends and colleagues Senators Lieberman and Warner are introducing their bill to cap carbon emissions. I would like to outline some of the ways their approach will unfairly and unnecessarily hurt our most vulnerable families and workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To begin with, capping carbon will make more expensive what we all depend upon in our everyday lives. Our heating bills in the winter, air conditioning bills in the summer, every time we put gas in our cars; they will all be much more expensive under their plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the rich can afford higher power bills, millions of struggling families cannot. Will we force them to  choose between heating their homes or buying school clothes for their children?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support higher Federal LIHEAP funding, but almost 30 million American families still cannot afford to pay their heating bills. How many millions more will suffer under this bill?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Millions of fixed-income seniors have no room in their budget for higher power bills. Will we force them to choose between air conditioning in the summer or buying their prescription medicine?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Blue collar workers supporting middle class families will also suffer when their manufacturing jobs flee the U.S. for cheaper energy sources in other countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Are we telling millions of auto assembly, steel, aluminum, plastics, fertilizer, cement, and lime workers we do not care about them supporting their modest families?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Lieberman-Warner bill admits it hurts vulnerable families and workers and tries to help them through rebates funded by carbon auctions. But vulnerable workers cannot afford to pay higher energy bills now and wait months later for a rebate check. Where do they get the extra money to pay their higher energy bills now? What do they go without while they are waiting to get their rebate check later?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The whole carbon auction and rebate system is inherently unfair and unnecessary. Some push it so that companies will not see windfall profits. I oppose windfall profits too, but they are only possible in 14 States, mostly in the northeast and west coast where electricity markets are deregulated. In the other 36 states with regulated markets, utilities are prevented by law from reaping windfall profits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That means a national carbon auction unfairly punishes 36 States in the midwest, mountain, west and south where there would be no problem. Mr. President, 36 States will pay higher energy bills then needed. Families and workers in 36 States will suffer unnecessarily. We must find a better way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Europe, in their system, made the mistake of passing out more carbon allowances then needed. We can easily avoid that mistake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As long as the obligation we impose to submit carbon allowances for carbon emissions is greater then the amount of allowances we pass out, there will be no surplus profits in those 36 regulated States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must address the issue of preemption. We will create havoc with a national carbon cap system on top of regional systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also need to set up a liability system for sequestering carbon underground. We do not want to set up an impossible situation where we capture all this carbon and have nowhere to put it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to guarantee that we will not harm low income families and vulnerable workers. Protections should kick in automatically at a set level, so that our struggling elements of society are not left to the whims of a fickle and vague cost containment system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to calibrate any cap plan to the ability of technology to meet that plan" The welfare of millions are too important to roll the dice that low carbon solutions are around the corner. We also cannot inflict too much pain on struggling families and workers in the interim while we wait for those clean energy solutions to come on line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many things we can do now to reduce carbon emissions. We have on the shelf or stuck in stalled legislative vehicles, measures to promote energy efficiency, promote low-carbon biofuels, cut vehicle emissions through aggressive but achievable stronger CAFE standards, require renewable and clean energy generation, increase renewable energy transmission, green buildings, carbon storage research and development, and clean energy research, development and deployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is 8 different ways I am prepared to reduce carbon emissions today. So before we go down the road of hurting the poor, hurting vulnerable workers, sending jobs overseas, let us take advantage of what we have now. Let us get serious about our energy future and fund a Manhattan project for clean energy. Let us get to work where we can join together and do so now.</paragraph>
