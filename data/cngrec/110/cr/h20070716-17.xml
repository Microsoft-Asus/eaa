    <paragraph>I introduced <bill type="h" number="1980">H.R. 1980</bill> earlier this year. It was referred to the Committee on Financial Services.

    <paragraph>At this point I will enter into the Record a letter from 266 organizations in support of the Housing Assistance Council, also known as HAC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>April 16, 2007. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR REPRESENTATIVES: We urge you to support congressional funding for the Housing Assistance Council (HAC), a national nonprofit intermediary organization, which has been committed for more than 35 years to supporting the development of affordable housing in the nation's most rural and underserved places. HAC has an excellent record as a lender, capacity builder, and information provider and should be included in the 2008 Department of Housing and Urban Development appropriation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We, the undersigned 266 organizations, represent vibrant, rural communities across America. Our efforts to build and sustain affordable housing for low-income rural residents are often complicated by funding cuts and capacity challenges. Throughout, HAC has been a staunch advocate, a lender, a source of information and technical advice, and a friend to rural housing providers. At times, when others have ignored rural America's needs, HAC has stood firm and kept rural issues at the forefront of  the national discourse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressional funding allows HAC to support rural communities and provide:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lending. HAC has loaned more than $217 million dollars to 1,875 organizations to develop 56,000 units of affordable housing. These loans have helped thousands of families own or rent affordable, decent homes in 49 states and the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Capacity Building Grants, Technical Assistance, and Training. HAC has raised and distributed more than $5 million in capacity building grants to nurture over 300 local nonprofit organizations engaged in affordable housing development. Grants, supported by technical assistance and training have a ripple effect, enabling recipient organizations to begin to sustain themselves and better serve their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Research and Information. The HAC website, ruralhome.org, helps to overcome the geographical isolation that impacts many rural communities and brings up-to-date information and technical resources to often disconnected rural communities. Taking Stock and other HAC research provide objective analysis of rural housing and poverty conditions that impact more than 55 million rural residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With continued congressional support, HAC can sustain and expand its exceptional work in the rural communities you represent across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for your consideration.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to thank my good friend Congresswoman Waters for working closely with me as she helped navigate this important rural housing legislation to this floor. I also want to recognize the important role her staff played in bringing this bill to the floor today. I commend Mikael Moore and Nat Thomas with Chairwoman Waters, as well as Jeff Riley with Congressman Frank for their time and efforts and patience and understanding while  working on this important legislation. I also want to acknowledge the good work of Jaime Lizarraga.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my capacity as chairman of the Congressional Rural Housing Caucus, I introduced <bill type="h" number="1980">H.R. 1980</bill>, the Housing Assistance Council Authorization Act of 2007, that supports rural communities' efforts to provide quality and affordable housing. It authorizes the Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide the Housing Assistance Council, known as HAC, with funds for technical assistance, for training, as well as support and advice. These types of assistance will help develop the business and  administrative capacities of rural community-based housing development organizations. Also, this bill will provide the Housing Assistance Council with funds to use to make loans, grants, or provide other financial assistance for community-based housing development organizations, which will help them develop affordable housing options for low- and moderate-income families throughout rural America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HAC will use some of these funds received as a result of this authorizing language and the appropriations process for below-market lending to local community and faith-based home builders with an emphasis on first-time low-income homeownership, particularly for minorities. When repaid, HAC will lend the funds again to new borrowers. The new capital will be used throughout rural America, including in five very high need areas: Appalachia, the Lower Mississippi Delta and Southeast, the Southwest  border region, Native American areas, and migrant farm worker regions throughout the country. These are areas where property rates and housing need are very high, development capacity is very low, and conventional financing tools do not always work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Housing Assistance Council has extensive experience and is uniquely qualified to carry out this work. HAC's 35-year-old nonprofit loan fund, where this new capital would be used, has lent over $220 million during their existence to nearly 1,900 organizations to develop almost 60,000 homes, and the fund has a loss rate of less than 1 percent. Madam Speaker, these loans have helped thousands of families own or rent affordable, decent homes in 49 States and the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico,  and has helped Proyecto Azteca in my congressional district. It is important to note that HAC is the only national assistance organization devoted solely to rural housing and community development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, 20 percent of our Nation's population lives in rural communities; yet far too many of these families live in conditions that are poor, inadequate, or run-down. This bill will go a long way towards improving the overall quality of life of rural Americans by providing them with the resources they need to improve the quality of housing in rural America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, I want to thank again Congresswoman MAXINE WATERS and Chairman BARNEY FRANK for their support for this important legislation and for bringing this bill to the floor for a vote today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400313" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to support <bill type="h" number="1980">H.R. 1980</bill>, the Housing Assistance Council Authorization Act of 2007, and would like to compliment the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa) for his work on this and also Chairwoman Waters for bringing this important initiative for rural communities to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation recognizes the work of the Housing Assistance Council in providing housing opportunities for low-income families in rural communities, and most of the Second District is rural communities in New Mexico. There are many others across this country, but we feel the direct impact in New Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although HAC has received funding through HUD appropriations since the early 1980s, the program has never been authorized. This bill would formally authorize assistance councils, which is important to ensure the continued success of the program and long-term goal of aiding individuals in low-income housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Housing Assistance Council is unique in nature and the only nonprofit designed to help improve rural housing. HAC should be particularly praised for its work on self-help housing initiatives, which promote personal stability and financial responsibility for low-income housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again I want to thank my colleagues for acknowledging the Housing Assistance Council's important contribution to affordable housing for rural communities, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400179" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to yield 5 minutes to my good friend the gentleman from New Hampshire, Congressman Paul Hodes, who has already made a mark in Congress during his first year in office.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412220" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1980">H.R. 1980</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rural poverty is a particularly harsh brand of indigence. It tends to be more extreme than urban poverty, and because it develops in areas far from television cameras and daily newspapers, to most people in this country, rural poverty is faceless. But its presence and its consequences are very real, and they present formidable challenges to both our country and our conscience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my own home State of New Hampshire, we have largely a rural State. Our cities by some measures are hardly cities. They are large towns. And while we are known for the beauty of our mountains and our lakes and our tourist economy as well as our high tech economy, there are pockets of intransigent rural poverty throughout our State. In the far north the rate of poverty is much higher than it is in most other places in the State, and generally the poverty rate in rural areas of the country is  14.6 percent, which tops that of most urban areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People who are living in rural poverty face numerous challenges. Inaccessibility of housing with high rents. In New Hampshire the average price for an apartment for a family of four is now $1,000, and this is at a time when folks who are living in rural areas are facing a softer economy and gas prices which are rising, and the challenge of finding a decent place to live for people who live in rural areas is a powerful challenge. People who live in rural areas are farther from basic services.  They are less likely to take advantage of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a desperate need in parts of our country, including my own State. And as the people's House, we have a moral imperative to help children and parents trapped in destitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1980">H.R. 1980</bill> and <bill type="h" number="1982">H.R. 1982</bill>, which will come to the floor later, are compassionate, responsible bills which encourage the development of low- and moderate-income housing in our most stricken areas. There is no doubt, because I have seen it with my own eyes on numerous occasions at home, that a clean, safe place to live is often the first step on the road to self-sufficiency. We are not talking about handouts. Encouraging economic development in poor areas helps creates jobs and a solid tax base,  which build toward self-sustaining prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="1980">H.R. 1980</bill> and its companion 1982 are wise, compassionate investments in our country's future. I urge my colleagues to support their passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400313" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400179" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is very important to many parts of Texas. As you know, when they redrew the lines of the Congressmen in Texas, I was given a 375-mile-long geographic area that had 90 communities. The greatest majority, 90 percent, were small rural communities who were asking when is Congress going to recognize the great need that we have for housing assistance?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to give you just one example of the route that I mentioned, Proyecto Azteca, which is one where people build their own homes. They provide the labor to build those homes with the supervision of some professional supervisors in construction of residential homes. The only assistance that we give them is the purchasing of the materials, the building materials, which amounts to about $30,000. And I wish you could see these homes. I wish you could see the fine work that is done in these  three-bedroom, one-bath homes that many have been built in our area with this type of assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I give this example because there are many serving in Congress who have never visited colonias like those that are in some parts of the southwestern part of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I say that this type of legislation is something that is going to go a long ways in helping provide many, many more affordable homes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1980">H.R. 1980</bill>, the Housing Assistance Council Authorization Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill authorizes $10 million for the Housing Assistance Council, HAC, in Fiscal Year 2008 and $15 million in Fiscal Years 2009-2014. HAC, a nonprofit corporation, is the only national intermediary focused solely on the tremendous affordable housing needs of rural areas and small towns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HAC assists in the development of both single-family homes and multi-family housing, and promotes homeownership for working low-income rural families. HAC maintains a special focus on high-need groups and regions: Indian country, the Mississippi Delta, farm workers, the Southwest border colonias, and Appalachia. In just the past 8 years, HAC has provided over $105 million in aid to hundreds of organizations in 160 Congressional districts. Since inception in 1971, HAC has helped build 60,000 affordable  homes in 49 states and 2 territories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The funds authorized by <bill type="h" number="1980">H.R. 1980</bill> will allow HAC to continue successfully assisting a national network of rural nonprofit, public and for profit builders. Specifically, HAC could continue providing grants, loans, technical assistance, training, and other support to build the capacity of rural community-based housing development organizations to create and sustain safe affordable housing. The bill also enables HAC to offer vital help to specific housing projects and initiatives these groups undertake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am especially pleased that this funding will enable HAC to bring its expertise to bear on the problem of rural homelessness. While my District does not encompass rural areas, it does have as many as 10,000 persons on any given night. And though it may not seem so at first blush, homelessness in central Los Angeles is related to rural homelessness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, in the absence of an adequately resourced network of housing and service providers in their home communities, poor rural folks who fall into homelessness often leave their family and social networks and move to larger urban areas in the hope of finding jobs, housing, and social services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While migrating from the countryside to the city, and vice versa, is an important and time-honored American tradition, these vulnerable households--often with few skills and suffering from disabilities or chronic health problems--too often experience homelessness again in the destination city. There, they enter public and private systems of care already stressed to the breaking point--as tragically exemplified by a recent "60 Minutes" story on so-called "hospital patient-dumping" in Los Angeles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1980">H.R. 1980</bill> will enable HAC to help interrupt this tragic cycle, by building the capacity of their network of housing developers and social service providers to care for the homeless and at-risk in their own hometowns--where they are most likely to escape homelessness and re-enter the economic mainstream.</paragraph>
