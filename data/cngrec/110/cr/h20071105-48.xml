    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the testimony and words as spoken by the gentleman from Illinois. I rise tonight to speak to congratulate Ross and Marianna Beach and the Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art on the occasion of the museum's grand reopening. Located in Manhattan, on the campus of Kansas State University, the Beach Museum of Art has become a cherished cultural center in the Flint Hills of my home State. Over the years, the museum has nearly tripled the number of their  works of art and has enhanced the lives of thousands of patrons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Originally opening on October 16, 1996, the museum offers a wide array of services to the area. While continually adding to the collection of regionally inspired art, the museum contributors have also made educational programs, lectures, tours, and workshops available. The new 15,000 square-foot addition of the Mary and Morgan Jarvis Wing is evidence of the museum's continuing success and benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Believing in art appreciation and education, the Beach Museum is poised to contribute to the culture in Kansas for generations to come. The impact the museum has on Kansas is immeasurable. Located on the campus of a nationally ranked university and in close proximity to Fort Riley, the Beach Museum serves a highly diverse population. Students, along with military personnel and their families, come from all over the globe to live, work, and learn. This oftentimes short-term community is always  pleased to discover an art museum of such fine quality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the efforts of Kansas State University president Dr. Jon Wefald and his wife, Ruth Ann, the museum has gained national notoriety. Mrs. Wefald's leadership on the museum advisory board has proven to be a major factor in the museum's rapid growth and expansion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The university, the City of Manhattan and the State of Kansas have benefited tremendously from the Wefalds' dedication. Gratitude is owed for their committed devotion to the museum. Museum director Lorne Render should be commended for guiding the museum into the 21st century. Through Lorne's service to the arts, the Beach Museum continues to offer exhibits and programs that enhance the quality of life of all Kansans and, in fact, many Americans. As the museum continues to contribute to the appreciation  of the arts, appreciation should be extended to Lorne for the museum and the museum's knowledgeable staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The museum would not have been possible but for the generous philanthropic ideals exhibited by the lead donors, Ross and Marianna Beach. The Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art was named by Mr. Beach for his wife in commemoration of their 50th wedding anniversary. Mr. And Mrs. Beach are longtime donors of talent and treasure to the State of Kansas. Their commitments to the arts extend beyond the Beach Museum in Manhattan. They were instrumental in establishing the Beach/Schmidt Performing Arts  Center on the campus of Fort Hays State University in Hays, Kansas. This center has been providing a venue for plays, speeches, debates, and concerts for more than 20 years. The Beachs' commitment to the arts extends across the State and is appreciated by Kansans from all walks of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife and I are proud to serve on the museum's board of visitors. We have witnessed, firsthand, the results Ross and Marianna Beach have attained. It is certain that the Beach legacy will be experienced by thousands of people for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to join me in acknowledging the Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art along with Ross and Marianna Kistler Beach for their contributions to our society. Kansas is proud to have the museum for our enlightenment and enjoyment. And I am also proud to call Ross and Marianna Beach my friends and fellow Kansans.</paragraph>
