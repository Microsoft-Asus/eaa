  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, some years ago, the distinguished and late great Senator from the State of Minnesota, Hubert H. Humphrey, said the following when he was talking about how we should evaluate budgets in government. He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The moral test of a government is how it treats those in the dawn of life, those in the shadows of life, and those in the twilight of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to speak of those in the dawn of their lives--children across America and especially the children of working families, working families who have no health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, despite good intentions and despite a good program I will be speaking about this morning, there are 9 million American children with no health insurance at all--9 million children. That is a blot on the American conscience--or should be--that there are 9 million children who have no health insurance at all. Justice cannot abide 9 million children in America with no health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the bad news. The good news is that we have a way to bring some relief to those children, to their families, and to the American economy. It is called the State Children's Health Insurance Program, known by the acronym SCHIP. So when I refer to SCHIP by that acronym, I am speaking of that program, the State Children's Health Insurance Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what this program does, and it bears repeating because of the broad coverage that important program provides to children across America. It provides comprehensive health insurance coverage to up to 6 million American children. It is financed jointly by State governments and the Federal Government. Currently, that program  costs the Federal Government just over $5 billion per year--a very small price to pay in a huge Federal budget with all the  return you get from that investment for our children. Remember what this program is: It is a program that covers the children of working families, those families whose incomes are too high to be covered by Medicaid and whose incomes are too low to have the coverage that is provided in the private market. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about families who are squeezed in between and who cannot afford coverage in the private market but also don't qualify for Medicaid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Pennsylvania, my home State, I am honored and proud to say that my father, Governor Casey, when he was the Governor of Pennsylvania, signed into law one of the first children's health insurance programs in the Nation in 1992. Since that time, not only in Pennsylvania but especially in our State, we have had broad bipartisan support for this program from Republican Governors and Democratic Governors. Currently, Governor Rendell is trying to expand the Children's Health Insurance Program in  Pennsylvania. That is a good thing because even though it covers as many as 150,000 Pennsylvania children, there are still over 130,000 children in the State of Pennsylvania who have no coverage. The Governor wants to attack that problem and reduce that number. Unfortunately, this Governor of Pennsylvania, Governor Rendell, as well as Governors across the country, in both parties, are unable to expand their programs if the budget proposal set forth by the President becomes the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what the Bush budget does when it comes to the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and I am quoting from a report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities: "The Bush budget provides less than half"--less than half--"of the funding needed for States to maintain existing caseloads." What we are talking about there is, going forward in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, in those budget years, the President's budget provides less than half the money to maintain the coverage  for those approximately 6 million children who have coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This doesn't even address the problem I started with this morning, the 9 million children who don't have any health care coverage at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to do two things. We have to make sure we maintain the coverage for the 6 million children who have it in America across the country in almost every State in the country. They are not divided by Democrat and Republican; they are children and their families, and they are part of the family of America. We have to make sure we maintain their coverage. At the same time, we have to expand coverage to begin to cover the 9 million who have no health insurance coverage at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is the effect of this budget on these families? The Bush budget has a funding shortfall over 5 years of $7 billion. That is a big number, but let us talk about that in terms of children. That is the most important thing here. That $7 billion shortfall equates, by 2012, to 1.4 million children losing their coverage. We are still on problem No. 1, those who have coverage who will lose it--1.4 million of them--if this budget goes through. That is what we are talking about when we talk about  this budget and this important program. But we have to make sure we do more than just maintain coverage; we have to make sure we expand it for the millions of children who don't have health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to conclude this morning with a couple of basic questions for the President, for the Senate, and for the House. This is what every elected official in Washington has to answer when they vote on this budget and when they vote on the question of the State Children's Health Insurance Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Question No. 1 for the President and for the Congress: Does the administration and the Congress want 1.4 million children to lose their health insurance coverage? You can't have it both ways. If you vote for the President's proposal, you are voting to cut 1.4 million kids from the insurance rolls. That is question No. 1, and it is a "yes" or "no" answer. There is no dodging that question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Question No. 2: Are tax breaks for millionaires and multimillionaires and billionaires more important than the State Children's Health Insurance Program? Do they have a higher priority? Do their needs come ahead of the children of working parents?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is another question we have to answer because there will be people in this town who will talk about the cost of expanding health insurance coverage or even maintaining the coverage that is there. They will say: Oh, that is going to cost lots of money. Well, I have to ask them a basic question: Are the millionaires and billionaires who have benefited year after year to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars--is their tax cut more important than children? It is a "yes" or "no" answer,  and that is what the Congress and the President have to answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, No. 3, the basic question for today, tomorrow, but especially for many years from now: Do you want the gross domestic product to grow? Do you want the American economy to grow? Because if you answer that question "yes," you cannot oppose the expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. You cannot. We know the benefits of providing health insurance to children. We know they will go to school ready to learn. We know they will be healthier in school, they will get higher  test scores, and they will have the benefit of higher education, hopefully, for many of them, and they will go on to achieve their full potential in the job market and help grow the American economy. So if you care about the economy today, tomorrow, and into the future, and you care about growing jobs, you must vote, in my judgment, to expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, it is about coverage. It is about maintaining that coverage, and it is about making sure 9 million kids have health insurance in the future. It is also making sure we do everything possible to reach every child and make sure that child's family is utilizing the great services of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. If we meet this obligation to cover the kids who are covered now, to make sure their coverage is maintained, and to cover the 9 million children, we will have gone  a long way toward meeting Hubert H. Humphrey's moral test of government: to make sure we are taking care and helping children in the dawn of their lives.</paragraph>
