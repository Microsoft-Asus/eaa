  <narrative>DRUG SAFETY -- (Senate - January 30, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="486">S486</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, last May, Senator Baucus and I began investigating GlaxoSmithKline regarding their diabetes drug, Avandia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We began this investigation when Dr. Steve Nissen at the Cleveland Clinic published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine. That study found a link between Avandia and heart attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shortly after we began our investigation, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former Deputy Commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration, wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. In that article, he insinuated that congressional investigators had obtained a copy of the Nissen study before it was published. Dr. Gottlieb suggested that this action called into question the integrity of both congressional investigators and Dr. Nissen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, congressional investigators did not get a copy of the Nissen study until it became public. But you can imagine my surprise when I learned that one of GlaxoSmithKline's own consultants leaked a copy of the study to GlaxoSmithKline weeks before it was published. The man who did this is Dr. Steven Haffner. He confirmed to my investigators that he faxed a draft of the study to GlaxoSmithKline weeks before it was published.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The New England Journal of Medicine picked Dr. Haffner to peer review the study submitted by Dr. Nissen. That means that Dr. Haffner was supposed to check the study for quality. He was not supposed to pass it back to GlaxoSmithKline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only did Dr. Haffner breach his agreement with the New England Journal of Medicine to properly peer review the Nissen study, but he violated practically every tenet of independence and integrity held sacred by the major medical journals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Haffner told my investigators that GlaxoSmithKline did not ask for an early copy of the Avandia study. But the question still remains about what the company did once they had the study. Maybe GlaxoSmithKline's executives returned the study to Dr. Haffner or maybe they contacted the New England Journal of Medicine to report this violation of publishing ethics. I don't know, but I have sent GlaxoSmithKline a letter asking how they behaved after Dr. Haffner leaked the study to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the most troubling aspect of this situation is that the integrity of another aspect of the scientific process is called into question--scientific peer review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This process ensures that other scientists will judge a study's quality before it is made public and becomes used as a marketing tool.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is only good quality science that separates modern pharmaceuticals from old-fashioned snake oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last few years, my investigations have found that the Food and Drug Administration has a very cozy relationship with drug companies. I have also discovered that drug companies spend big bucks to influence which drugs doctors prescribe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I have shown that some drug companies intimidate scientists who speak up about bad drugs. Now it appears that even peer-reviewed science is not completely without its own problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I close, I would like to ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record my letter to GlaxoSmithKline.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>U.S. SENATE,</narrative>
  <narrative>COMMITTEE ON FINANCE,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, January 30, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR MR. VIEHBACHER: As the Ranking Member of the United States Senate Committee on Finance (Committee), I have an obligation to the more than 80 million Americans who receive health care coverage under Medicare and Medicaid to ensure that taxpayer and beneficiary dollars are appropriately spent on safe and effective drugs and devices. This includes the responsibility to conduct oversight of the medical and pharmaceutical industries that provide products and services to Medicare and Medicaid  beneficiaries.</narrative>
  <narrative>The purpose of this letter is to determine what action, if any, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)  took after receiving a leaked manuscript of a study prior to its publication on May 21, 2007 in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). This study reported a link between heart attacks and Avandia, a drug GSK sells to control glucose levels in diabetics.</narrative>
  <narrative>GSK representatives informed the Committee last summer that a peer reviewer leaked the study to them weeks before it was published. GSK later acknowledged to the Committee that the peer reviewer was Dr. Haffner. Dr. Haffner confirmed this fact noting also that he was peer reviewing the study for NEJM when he faxed the study to GSK. According to documents filed at the FDA, GSK has paid Dr. Haffner around $75,000 in consulting fees and speaking honoraria since 1999.</narrative>
  <narrative>Dr. Haffner told Committee investigators that no one at GSK asked him to send them this study about Avandia. Nonetheless, I am interested in what GSK did after receiving the study. Did GSK return the study to Dr. Haffner? Did GSK contact the NEJM to report this violation of publishing ethics? I would appreciate a detailed description of what GSK did after receiving the unpublished study regarding one of their leading drugs. Accordingly, please respond to the following questions and request for  documents:</narrative>
  <narrative>1. Please provide a list of all GSK employees who received and/or learned of the results contained in the leaked copy of the manuscript prior to publication by NEJM.</narrative>
  <narrative>2. Please provide copies of all documents, records, and recordings of telephone messages regarding the NEJM manuscript that was leaked to GSK before publication.</narrative>
  <narrative>3. Please provide the following dates: a. When did GSK first contact the data safety monitoring board of the RECORD trial to begin publication of interim results?</narrative>
  <narrative>b. When did GSK begin pulling together the interim data of the RECORD trial? c. When did GSK submit the interim results of the RECORD trial to NEJM for possible publication?</narrative>
  <narrative>4. Please provide copies of all documents, records, communications, and recordings of telephone messages regarding the publication of the interim results of the RECORD trial.</narrative>
  <narrative>5. Please provide copies of any other pre-publication study drafts that GSK received about one of its products. Please do not include these drafts if a GSK employee was an author on the study. This request covers the period of January 1, 2000 to the present.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you again for your continued assistance in this matter. I would appreciate receiving the documents and information requested by no later than February 15, 2008. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Paul Thacker or Emilia DiSanto of my Committee.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Charles E. Grassley,</narrative>
