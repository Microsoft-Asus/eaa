    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I had a constituent come up to me over the weekend and say Congress has no energy plan. I corrected that person. The Democrats' leadership is no energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just in the last few months, Congress has voted under their leadership to take shale from Colorado and Wyoming off limits for extracting the oil. Last week coal-to-liquid for aviation fuel was banned. The Air Force is not allowed to enter into a long-term contract to buy that type of synthetic fuel. We are going backwards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reality is if we bring all of our resources together, yes, conservation, yes, alternative fuels, and open up the resources that we have right here in America offshore where there is a moratorium that Congress can lift, a moratorium that was imposed by Congress on shale oil that can be lifted by Congress, and in Alaska where Congress can lift that moratorium, if we combine all of those resources, we can be free of OPEC. It is time for a real energy policy where we free our resources for American-made  energy.</paragraph>
