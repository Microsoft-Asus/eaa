    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on the week of November 18 we begin to celebrate in this Nation National Bible Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National Bible Week is the National Bible Association's signature event which is celebrated the week before Thanksgiving every year since it began in 1941.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this week, we encourage the citizens of this Nation to read the Bible. Mr. Speaker, I must admit that I was not always an ardent Bible reader. I was always in and around the church, but as so many of us who belong to church, I was in the church, but church wasn't in me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I came to this Congress in 1993 and almost immediately upon my presence here I received a Bible similar to this given by Rev. Dr. D. James Kennedy. And, Mr. Speaker, I found my evenings alone, my wife and my family back in Chicago, and somehow I had a prompting to pick up the Bible and to read the Bible. I must admit, Mr. Speaker, that although I wasn't an ardent reader, now I'm a ferocious reader of the Bible, avaricious in my interests in terms of the words recorded in God's living  book.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I must say that I have been renewed as a man by the renewing of my mind according to the dictates and the Spirit that's incorporated in the reading of the Bible. I am a changed man; I am a new man. I don't have the same friends I used to have. I don't walk the same way; I don't talk the same way, and it's all because of this Bible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am an activist, and for years I had shunned this Bible because it didn't speak to my activism. And then the Holy Spirit spoke to me through my conversations and through my interests in reading the Bible. And, Mr. Speaker, I came across a Scripture that really moved me, two, as a matter of fact. One is taken from the Old Testament, Micah 6:6-8: "With what shall I come before the Lord and bow myself before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a  year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of ram, 10,000 rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Lord answers, "He has shown you, O man, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? But to do justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in those words, it encapsulated all that I had attempted to be, my activism, my love for humanity and my love for the Lord. Mr. Speaker, Luke 4 and 4:18: "The spirit of the Lord is upon Me. Because He has anointed me to preach the Gospel to the poor. He has sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my life had been, and continues today, to be a reflection of the spirit that is within me, the Holy Spirit that is within me. I call on all good citizens, Christians and non-Christians alike, during this week and every week of the year, pick up your Bible. Read the Bible. You have no better friend. You have no better solution than what is recorded in these words.</paragraph>
