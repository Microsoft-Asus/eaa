  <speaking speaker="300098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor the musical genius of fellow Ohioan Vincenzo Antonio Manno, a renowned opera singer and devoted professor of music.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Manno was born and raised in my great hometown of Cleveland, OH. In fact, he grew up right down the street from my family in the Collinwood neighborhood--the same neighborhood I live in still today. But his musical gift eventually took him far beyond Collinwood to some of the finest music institutions in Europe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cleveland's rich cultural environment and outstanding music tradition prepared Mr. Manno for his world-renowned career. Before completing his studies at Oberlin College under the tutelage of Professor Richard Mill, Mr. Manno was trained at the Cleveland Music School Settlement under Burton Garlinghouse and John Shurtleff; at summer sessions in Chautauqua, NY, under Josephine Antoine; and at the Cleveland Institute of Music under Eleonor Steber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After receiving his degree from Oberlin, Mr. Manno continued his studies on a Fulbright Fellowship in Italy at Santa Ceclia in Rome with Ettore Campogalliani. His private studies in Milan continued with Dr. Otto Mueller, who was affiliated for years with the Metropolitan Opera House of New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After Dr. Mueller's death, Mr. Manno was accepted into the prestigious private singing school directed by Professor Dennis Hall in Bern, Switzerland. As a result of his studies with Professor Hall, Mr. Manno was encouraged to open a voice studio in Milan, which has become a mecca for singers from around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Manno's singing career embraces a wide repertory--from the baroque to the modern--and he has sung with opera companies around the world. His radio performances within Europe have been admired by the public and critics alike. And, he is currently a permanent member of the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, Italy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not all accomplished musicians make good teachers, but Mr. Manno's teaching career has taken great strides in the past 10 years. He has been recognized for teaching and helping emerging singers on many continents. He also holds seminars and master classes on singing style.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Manno is regularly invited to teach singing technique at the world-renowned Accademia dei Giovani Cantanti--Academy of Young Singers--under the artistic direction of Leyla Gencer, affiliated with the Teotro alla Scala and the Accademia Internazionale della Musica--International Music Academy--in Milan. The students of Vincenzo Manno can be heard regularly around the world in opera houses, recording studios, concerts halls, and radio and television stations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Manno also lends his expertise in pop music, broadway and operetta. He has guided many Italian pop singers through recording sessions and is regularly contacted by Italian television to help arrange songs for singers and give advice on new compositions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all he has accomplished, Mr. Manno has received several awards. He received the "Grand Prix du Disque" for baroque music recorded with the great Swiss conductor Edwin Loehrer, and the "Best Recording of the Year" from Gramophone Magazine for his second CD solo recording of tenor music of the 17th century, "Strana Armonia d'Amore" with Roberto Gini.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on the 40th anniversary of his career, it is my pleasure to honor Vincenzo Antonio Manno for his great success and significant contributions to the world of music.</paragraph>
