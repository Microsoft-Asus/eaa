    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, even after losing 3,200 American lives and spending billions of taxpayer dollars since declaring "Mission Accomplished" 4 years ago, the Bush administration continues to demand an open-ended commitment of American troops in Iraq. Yesterday President Bush refused to change the course when he vetoed a bill that was supported by Congress, retired military generals and the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Democratic Congress put forth a plan for a responsible end to the war consistent with our national security needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even Secretary of Defense Gates himself reiterated last month that congressional debate was helpful. He delivered the message to the Iraqi Government that the clock is ticking on U.S. operations there. President Bush's veto yesterday lets the Iraqi Government off the hook and shows the President plans to keep our troops there indefinitely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the days of rubber-stamping the President's war proposals are long over. The President is going to have to learn to work with the Democratic leadership on this Congress so that we can find a way out of Iraq soon, and so we can provide our troops with the resources they need.</paragraph>
