  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the Homeland Security appropriations bill, <bill type="h" number="2638">H.R. 2638</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is my understanding that the majority leader plans to take up this bill next week, not this week; is that right?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would really like to take it up now. That is why I asked this consent. I am sorry if there was some confusion in that regard.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>It was my understanding the majority leader was planning to go to a reconciliation bill next and then try to get unanimous consent to go to this next week.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>The only reason I was doing that, of course, is that there was an inkling from your floor staff you would object to us going to this immediately.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am going to object in the short term, and we can discuss it privately because I think there is a chance we can do that shortly. But for the moment I will object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
  <chair>The majority leader is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am hopeful and confident we can work something out in this regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to protect our country, and all of us, I move to proceed to the consideration of <bill type="h" number="2638">H.R. 2638</bill> and send a cloture motion to the desk.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The cloture motion having been presented under rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:</chair>
  <chair>Cloture Motion</chair>
  <chair>We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 206, <bill type="h" number="2638">H.R. 2638</bill>, the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2008.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would also say, and hopefully we won't have to do this, I am cautiously optimistic we can avoid this, but I will ask unanimous consent that in case we can't, the mandatory quorum call under rule XXII be waived.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I now withdraw the motion.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The motion is withdrawn.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me just say a few more words. We have been prevented from acting on the 9/11 recommendations. I should say that now we are in conference, and I am so appreciative of that. I understand Chairman Lieberman is going to hold his first meeting tomorrow. It took a while  to get there, but that is important. But we also need to change the course in Iraq, and that didn't happen, and so now we have this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have all seen and heard reports that our intelligence community has concluded that al-Qaida's strength has grown to its 9/11 levels, and the statement of the Secretary of Homeland Security that he has a gut feeling we are at greater risk of being attacked this summer by terrorists. In spite of all this, we have just seen an example of obstructionism that has slowed down and prevented the Senate from consideration of this bill today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The latest obstruction would delay important investments. This Homeland Security bill does lots of things. We just finished the immigration debate. This is not as good for border security as the immigration bill would have been--I don't expect we will do that debate today--but it does do some good things. This bill hires 3,000 more Border Patrol agents and provides 4,000 more detention beds. When someone is picked up, they will have a place to put them. This provides $400 million for port security  grants. This bill provides $1.83 billion for State and local first responders. And one other example is that this bill provides monies for the purchase and installation of explosive detection equipment at airports.</paragraph>
