  <narrative>(Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400206" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, to help families dealing with the high price of gas, the White House ended the ban on deep ocean energy exploration. Now it's up to the Congress to give this commonsense move the final green light.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must pursue increasing production of American-made energy in an environmentally conscious manner off the coast of the Atlantic, the Gulf, and the Pacific. We have the technology to access fuels right here in America while still protecting our natural resources for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should and must develop our own oil and natural gas resources in the deep waters offshore, on Federal lands, and in oil shale if we want to revive America's independence. It's past time Congress got off the dime and approved deep ocean energy exploration today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans, the future of America is at stake.</paragraph>
