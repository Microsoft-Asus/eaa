  <narrative>COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HYPOCRISY -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10907]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. PITTS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Columbia University defended the Iranian President's speech by invoking the right to free speech and speaking about open exchange of ideas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>None of what he said on Monday could be construed as such. He dodged questions about his Holocaust denial. He ignored questions about his country's role in the death of American soldiers in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This same university does not allow our military's ROTC program on campus because they believe the military's "don't ask, don't tell policy" is discriminatory toward homosexuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if Columbia is that concerned about defending homosexuals, why did they let this dictator on campus? His regime doesn't discriminate against gays; it executes them. More than 400 homosexuals so far executed like this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Columbia University provided Mr. Ahmadinejad a sense of legitimacy and a forum that he will no doubt use to his advantage at home and abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unfortunate they don't provide the same to the fine young men and women of our armed services.</paragraph>
