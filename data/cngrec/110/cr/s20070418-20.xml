    <paragraph>Mr. President, Sunday is the 37th anniversary of Earth Day. I have been pleased to read reports that people across the country are planning to come together to celebrate our environmental accomplishments and to renew their environmental commitment to future and current generations. Everyone should celebrate the major steps forward we have taken to achieve clean air and water, to reduce pollution, and to clean up hazardous waste sites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earth Day is celebrated because of the great work of former Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin. In 1970, he founded Earth Day to celebrate the environment and to bring attention to the legislative challenges facing those who want to want to protect the environment. Senator Nelson also cosponsored the Wilderness Act of 1964, a law that has been amazingly important to protecting Nevada's beauty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevada is one of the many States that has greatly benefited from the increased environmental awareness that former Senator Nelson helped to cultivate. Nevada's dramatic landscapes from the high alpine lakes of the Ruby Mountains to the stark open spaces of the Black Rock Desert to the incredible Joshua tree forests in the Piute Valley have provided inspiration to generations of Nevadans. Protecting Nevada's wild lands ensured that those who follow us will have the same opportunity to find and  experience these incredible places as we had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Wilderness Act of 1964, which was cosponsored by former Senator Nelson, has done tremendous things in Nevada. I have been proud to help designate nearly 2 million acres of wilderness across Nevada, in addition to creating the Sloan Canyon, Red Rock Canyon, and Black Rock Desert-High Rock Canyon National Conservation Areas and Great Basin National Park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Protecting and serving our environment has always been one of my passions, and I have twice had the privilege to chair the Environment and  Public Works Committee. During that time, I had the chance to write the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996, to revise the Clean Air Act, and to improve the Endangered Species Act, Superfund, and the Clean Water Act. In each case, I advocated for laws that not only protect the environment but that are flexible,  take advantage of market mechanisms, and reflect the unique needs and circumstances of the West.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was always pleased that I was able to work in a bipartisan manner with my colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee. Republicans, Democrats, and Independents all understood that protecting the environment did not have to be a partisan issue, and I was glad that various presidents joined in our efforts. That is why it is so distressing today to see the current administration's policies pursued in such a manner because environmental issues could and should be bipartisan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, our understanding grows about how important it is to conserve and protect our land and its rich resources. While the current administration's environmental rollbacks are far too numerous to count, it started with attempts to loosen arsenic standards for drinking water and centers today around their total unwillingness to work together on a plan that will first stabilize and then reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Global warming and climate change is the single greatest environmental challenge that will confront current and future generations. We have a moral obligation to address this issue and choosing to ignore this problem is madness and a luxury we do not have the time for. I once again urge my colleagues not to fall for the temptation of the administration's voluntary "technology-only" strategy. That strategy has only increased emissions and the risks associated with global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The negative impacts that have been linked to global warming and climate change are also far too numerous to mention, but I am continually concerned about the impacts that climate change will have on water in Nevada. Most recently, the National Resources Conservation Service recorded that snowpack throughout the Sierra Nevada Mountains is only at 40 to 50 percent or normal. In eastern Nevada, due to decreases in the snowpack, the stream flow for the Humboldt River is expected to only be at 34  percent and the lower Colorado River at 19 percent of its average. A recent study published in Science said all but one of the 19 major climate models project that the Southwest is at the beginning of a deepening drought largely due to greenhouse gas concentration increases and global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The challenge of eliminating our Nation's overdependence on oil and other greenhouse gas emitting fossil fuels will be a great test for our country and for the world. I believe that America can lead the way in developing new technologies to meet and pass this test. We can and must become more energy independent through the rapid development and diversification of clean, alternative, and renewable sources of energy. They will provide a steady, reliable energy supply, bolster our national security,  protect the environment, and create new jobs and whole new industries. We must tap into our Nation's spirit of innovation and bring a new environmental ethic to our energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every day, not just on Earth Day, we have to work together to protect our environment from threats so our children and our grandchildren and so on can drink clean water, breath clean air, and enjoy the vast open spaces and the natural beauty of Nevada, America, and the world. That much is for certain, and I look forward to bringing that commitment to everything that I and this Senate undertake.</paragraph>
