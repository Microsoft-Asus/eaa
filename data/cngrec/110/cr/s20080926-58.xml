  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in honor of a very special event--the 110th birthday celebration of my hometown, Searchlight, NV. My colleagues have heard me speak often of Searchlight, and they all know how proud I am to call it home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On July 20, 1898, Searchlight was established like many towns across the West were--as a mining district. George Frederick Colton had struck gold the year before, bringing a rush of miners to the area. Over the next 10 years, Searchlight provided millions of dollars of gold to the world and grew to be one of the most populated areas in southern Nevada. During the mines' most prosperous years, Searchlight was one of the most modern, well-appointed towns in the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Searchlight's mining boom may have ended 100 years ago, the pioneering spirit lives on in our small community. And on Saturday, October 4, 2008, the residents of Searchlight will commemorate the passing of the town's 110th year with a BBQ dinner and various activities. I join the community in thanking the Searchlight Museum Guild for organizing this celebration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, I would like to recognize my friend Jane Overy, curator of the Searchlight Historic Museum. Jane was instrumental in the founding of the museum, and she continues her work as Searchlight's resident historian in the planning of this year's birthday celebration program, "Sharing Searchlight's Historic Memories." In addition to her work with the museum, Jane is involved with many town activities and is a well-known and well-loved figure in our community. She is a Navy veteran and  she and her husband Carl, an Air Force veteran, have been very active members of Nevada's proud military community. Jane currently serves as the Department Commander for Nevada Disabled American Veterans. She has been a dedicated collector and preserver of Searchlight's history, and I am grateful for her contributions to the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my office in the Capitol, I keep a picture of my childhood home in Searchlight. It serves as a reminder of how my hometown has shaped my work on behalf of Nevada throughout my career in Congress. I am proud to recognize the historic occasion of Searchlight's 110th birthday, and I wish its residents a successful and enjoyable event.</paragraph>
