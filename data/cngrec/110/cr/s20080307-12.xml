  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today to call again upon our colleagues in this chamber to move forward with a package that addresses housing challenges we face here in America today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The dream of American home ownership is very much at risk today. We are seeing a housing crisis and a financial crisis here in America that is unparalleled in recent times. In fact, when you speak to the home mortgage industry as well as the homebuilders, as well as the homeowners, they will all tell you we have not seen anything like this in America since the Great Depression. The statistics and the facts are there to demonstrate this, as well as the reality of people who are losing their homes,  and more than even those who are losing their homes, who have to go through the pain and heartache of losing their homes because they cannot afford to pay the adjusted rate mortgages which are putting them in a position where they cannot afford to stay</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This chart is a chart that was prepared by Moody's, a group of economists that came up essentially to give us the facts and the statistics that demonstrate, without equivocation, that this is an unprecedented housing downturn we are seeing. This is a worse downturn than anything we saw in the 1990s and the 1980s, and, in fact, their conclusion is that we have never seen such a downturn since the Great Depression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to point out two things on this chart. The first is that the housing prices are projected to decline overall across the Nation by nearly 16 percent. We know that most Americans, most middle-class Americans in this country who are in a home have most of their equity, their value in life, tied up in their home. So when you have a decline in their home values by 16 percent, you are impacting the American homeowners in a very significant way. That is why, when we talk about the foreclosure  crisis which is facing America, it is not about those who are on the verge of losing their homes; it is about all American homeowners because of the kind of price decline we are seeing in values in homes all across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A 16-percent decline in home values, I would suspect, is something that is of grave concern to most Americans. I would think this Chamber, as well as our colleagues in the House of Representatives, as well as the White House, should be saying that as part of an economic stimulus package, we ought to pivot over to the housing issues that face America and do something to restore confidence in the housing markets of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another indicator from Moody's, as you see in this chart, is with respect to housing starts. You look at the trough in housing starts in the 1980s, where housing starts declined to about 58 percent. Well, the economists are telling us now that given the high rates of foreclosure, what is happening is there is no end in sight. This red line has no end in sight, where you have a 60-percent decline in housing starts. We do not know how far that is going to go. When you have that kind of decline  in housing starts, you are going to be affecting several hundred thousand Americans who are in the job market as part of the housing industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So these statistics, which are national statistics out of Moody's, should be telling us all that we should be doing something about the housing crisis here in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am certain the Presiding Officer from Ohio can paint a similar picture about the housing problems in Ohio because there is a problem in the Presiding Officer's State as well as Florida and Nevada and California and many other States around the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I look at what the housing crisis means for the 5 million people in Colorado, it tells me we have a severe problem in my State as well. Today in Colorado, 1 out of every 376 homes is in foreclosure. That is the highest rate of foreclosure we have seen in the history of the State. It is unprecedented. We are not yet at the point where we have hit bottom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you look at foreclosures that are expected to occur between 2008 and 2009 in Colorado, projections are that nearly 50,000 homes--49,923--will go into foreclosure. For a State with 5 million people, that is a significant number. What will that mean in terms of the impact on other homeowners around the State? About 748,000 homes are going to suffer a significant decline in value. That is about half of all the homes in the State of Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Majority Leader Reid, now more than a week ago, came to the Chamber and said what we ought to do is pivot off of the economic stimulus package, which we worked out with the President, and move forward to address some other ailments in the economy--and he said the first of those ailments is the housing crisis--he was right. This Chamber should have moved forward and started to address the housing crisis. Instead, we ended up in 1 of the now 73 filibusters we have had to address.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues, Republican and Democratic, come back and say: No, this is too serious an issue. It is something we have to address with the 2008 Foreclosure Prevention Act which Majority Leader Reid had filed at the desk and, with amendments, we can try to make sure we have an effective remedy for this ailment we are facing in America today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you pick up the newspapers of today, they show this is a problem that continues to be at the highest level of attention for our people. USA Today, in its headline, talks about how home equity is below the 50-percent level. That is a figure that came out of the Federal Reserve Board yesterday. It is the lowest home equity level since 1945. To me that is another clarion call for this Congress to do something about the housing issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pick up the Wall Street Journal from today. It reads: "Housing and Bank  Troubles Deepen." The statistics are all there. We know we have a huge problem on our hands in terms of this pillar of the economy ailing. We also know this is causing pain to American homeowners, and the dream of American home ownership is in jeopardy today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I call on my colleagues in the Senate to move forward and address this issue in a robust way. I am hopeful in succeeding weeks we are able to put together a coalition of Democrats and Republicans who say that this housing crisis must be addressed now for the sake of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
