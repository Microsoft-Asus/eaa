  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="SPECIALIST CHAD D. GROEPPER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an American hero who was killed on February 17, 2008, in Diyala Province, Iraq, while supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom. His bravery and selflessness will not be forgotten. I extend my thoughts and prayers to his wife Stephanie, his daughter Clarissa, and all his family and friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chad Groepper was raised in Kingsley, IA, and graduated from Kingsley-Pierson Community High School in 2004. He enlisted shortly after his graduation. Chad was known for his ability to put smiles on faces, make people laugh, and for being involved with outside sports such as dirt biking and  four-wheeling. He met his wife while stationed at Fort Lewis, WA, and their daughter is only 4 months old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Groepper was assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division out of Fort Lewis, WA. He will be remembered for his courageous sacrifice and energetic personality. Kingsley mayor Wayne Plendl describes Groepper as "a nice, nice young man who was highly thought of." He will be greatly missed. I ask my colleagues here in the Senate and all Americans to remember with gratitude and appreciation a heroic soldier, SPC Chad D.  Groepper.</paragraph>
