  <speaking speaker="400257" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of National Bullying Prevention Awareness Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bullying among children is aggressive behavior that is intentional and often repeated over time. It is estimated that 3.2 million students are bullied each year. These children that are victims of bullying often have a hard time defending themselves. They are the target of hitting, teasing, name-calling, intimidation and social exclusion. With the arrival of the digital age, bullying is taking place over e-mail in online communities such as MySpace and Facebook.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no single cause of bullying among school children. Several factors can make a child the target of aggressive bullying. What we do know is that students with disabilities and special needs are more often targeted by bullies. Overweight and obese children are also far more likely to be the victims of bullying. This weight-based teasing often causes body image issues with the children, sometimes leading to depression and even suicide. Bullying can often be a sign of serious antisocial behavior,  and many children who bully are often dealing with issues in their home life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have all seen the horrors that can occur when bullying does go unchecked. The students at Columbine High School were the subjects of constant bullying. We are all aware of what happened when they reached their breaking point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress cannot sit and wait for another tragedy to occur before we act. That is why I have introduced, with my colleague, today's resolution. The resolution recognizes this week as National Bullying Prevention Awareness Week, and commends the many programs and organizations that do great work in preventing the cycle of bullying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 762, supporting the goals of National Bullying Prevention Awareness Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Health Resources and Services Administration of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, bullying is aggressive behavior that is intentional, repeated over time, and involves an imbalance of power or strength.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In practical terms, bullying happens when one child purposely hurts, scares or intimidates another. Bullying can seriously affect the mental and physical health as well as the academic work of children who are targeted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bullying can take place face to face, online or through other types of technology, such as text messaging over cell phones. The person being bullied has a difficult time defending himself or herself and feels victimized or abused. Usually bullying happens repeatedly, and studies show that between 15 and 25 percent of U.S. students are bullied with some frequency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bullying is prevalent, and children are concerned about it. In a 2003 Harris poll of 8- to 17-year-old girls commissioned by the Girl Scouts of America, bullying topped girls' lists of concerns regarding their safety. When asked what they worried most about, the common response was being socially ostracized, being made fun of, or being teased. To protect kids who are bullied, parents and adults must understand what bullying is, how harmful it can be, and the best ways to stop bullying behaviors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the American Psychological Association, the most effective prevention strategies are comprehensive in nature, involving the entire school as a community working to change the climate of the school and norms of behavior. It's crucial that parents, educators and administrators, health care professionals and researchers work together to reduce bullying. Campaigns are taking place in the U.S. and abroad to teach children that they play an important role in the prevention of bullying  and to raise awareness of the problem among adults. Children should feel comfortable in their communities and in their schools. They should not have to fear harassment, abuse or exclusion. We must continue to support efforts to combat bullying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. McCarthy) for introducing this resolution. I ask for my colleagues' support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from New York (Mr. Kuhl) for his work in working on this bipartisan agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to Congresswoman Linda S&#xE1;nchez from California, who has been working on this issue for many, many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="T, LINDA" of="">
    <paragraph>S&#xC1;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this resolution, supporting the goals of National Bullying Prevention Week. It is time that we recognize that bullying is a serious problem and support our local communities in their attempts to address it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Contrary to what is sadly still popular belief, bullying is neither a minor nuisance nor something to be laughed off. It is not a rite of passage, but instead an aggressive interference with a child's right to go to school, to learn, and to play in safety. Although any child may be bullied, some children face much greater risks than others. Children whom others perceive to be gay or lesbian are especially at risk, as are children who are obese.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just what kind of dangers do these children face? Here are just two stories of students bullied on the basis of their sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One California student was recently subjected to verbal harassment and name-calling by students and teachers, spit on in school hallways, subjected to sexually suggestive touching, and even referred to an independent study program, as if the bullying and harassment were the victim's fault.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Kentucky student received death threats, repeated unwanted sexual contact, offensive and hostile verbal abuse, and sexual intimidation and humiliation, including sexually explicit graffiti on the school parking lot depicting two male figures engaged in a sexual act with the student's name above the picture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is regrettable that not all my colleagues agree that all adults should be treated equally regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. But surely we can agree that all children deserve to be protected from abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many as three-quarters of school shooting incidents have been linked to bullying and harassment. We know that the shooters in the Columbine High School and Virginia Tech tragedies were bullying victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, even in the face of this evidence, many communities have still failed to take action against bullying. It is time for us to stop making excuses for aggressive behavior. Instead of letting our most vulnerable young people fend for themselves, we, as adults, must help schools address this problem. We must get the word out that bullying is never okay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kids can't succeed in school if they're being bullied and harassed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm pleased to be able to honor today a wide variety of groups that are working to help parents, schools, and communities combat bullying and harassment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also honor those that teach children how to nonviolently defend themselves against bullying, whether in person or via electronic means such as e- mail, telephone, or text message. For example, nonprofit groups like i-SAFE, TeenAngels, and TweenAngels have developed curricula that help children and youth stay safe online. And the National PTA and the American Psychological Association have provided instrumental support for efforts to assist local schools  in their attempts to create a safer, bullying-free environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am so pleased that Congress is working in a bipartisan way to advance this resolution, which recognizes that bullying and harassment are violent and damaging behaviors that we can and must address.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, I am pleased that Chairman George Miller and Ranking Member BUCK MCKEON of the Education and Labor Committee have already gone a step farther. In their No Child Left Behind reauthorization discussion draft, they have included language that will ensure that schools can use their Safe and Drug Free Schools funding to reduce bullying and harassment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me, not only in supporting this resolution, but also in supporting other legislation that would protect our children and youth from bullying and harassment. No student should be denied full access to education as a result of the fear and intimidation that stems from instances of bullying and harassment. All our children deserve to be safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend again the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. McCarthy) for her work on this resolution. Thank you.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I might inquire as to whether or not the gentlewoman from New York has any additional speakers.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400257" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we have no more speakers.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would thank the gentlewoman for bringing this resolution to the floor once again, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400257" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we have heard some points about bullying in our schools across America. Recently, the Girl Scouts of America had actually done a survey. In my home district, they asked their Girl Scouts and their Brownies on addressing bullying and asked if any of them had participated in it. They were actually shocked at how many of their girls, Girl Scouts, actually participated in bullying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that when we look at bullying today, it is an issue that teachers, parents, students themselves need to be educated on. With that, I am hoping that this resolution will go forward so people are aware. Bullying cannot be tolerated. It does hurt our young people. It certainly hurts their self-image. It is something that we need to face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
