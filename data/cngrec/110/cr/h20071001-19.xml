    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in supporting <bill type="h" number="2276">H.R. 2276</bill>, which names a postal facility in Vassar, Michigan, after Corporal Christopher E. Esckelson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2276">H.R. 2276</bill>, which was introduced by Representative Kildee of Michigan on May 10, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on September 20, 2007, by a voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire Michigan congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Marine Corporal Christopher E. Esckelson was killed on December 28, 2006, while conducting combat operations in al Anbar Province, Iraq. He was assigned to 1st Battalion, 24th Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division, Lansing, Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In October of 2002, Corporal Esckelson joined the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve and attended Delta College. His desire was to become a doctor, but he was called to active duty in April 2006. Corporal Esckelson was extremely proud to be a marine and committed to serve his country with distinction and courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I commend Representative Kildee for introducing this legislation and urge swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="2276">H.R. 2276</bill> honors the life of a young man who fought bravely for his country and made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. Corporal Christopher Esckelson was killed during combat action in Fallujah, Iraq on December 28, 2006. He was less than 1 week shy of reaching his 23rd birthday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Christopher Esckelson felt personal anger after September 11, 2001, when his country was brutally attacked, and he knew immediately he wanted to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps. In addition to defending his country, it was a way to earn money for college. His plans included attending medical school. His dream of becoming a doctor, however, was cut short on a 5-day mission fighting insurgents in a war-torn Fallujah.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal Esckelson was a squad leader of 12 men and suffered a direct hit during a mission. His leadership skills were proven day in and day out while in Iraq. He knew the risks involved and experienced the horrors of war. But his determination to fight and win was evident. He was fearless on the battlefield.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Christopher never had the chance to return home safely from the war or attend medical school as he planned, but he will surely be remembered in his community by the naming of this post office in his hometown of Vassar, Michigan. I am pleased to support <bill type="h" number="2276">H.R. 2276</bill> in naming of the post office for this valiant soldier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to Representative Kildee from Michigan.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am proud to be the sponsor of <bill type="h" number="2276">H.R. 2276</bill>. <bill type="h" number="2276">H.R. 2276</bill> will designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 203 North Main Street in Vassar, Michigan, as the "Corporal Christopher E. Esckelson Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal Esckelson of Vassar, Michigan, heroically gave his life fighting for our country in Fallujah, Iraq, on December 28, 2006, 2 days shy of his 23rd birthday. Corporal Esckelson, the squad leader of 12 men, suffered a direct hit while inspecting a truck in war-torn Fallujah, Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal Esckelson's leadership qualities came to fruition long before he began to serve our country. An outstanding athlete at Vassar High School, Christopher Esckelson played the game of football like he did life, with great passion. That same passion is what drove the aspiring doctor to join the Marines shortly after the September 11 attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He once told his mother, Michelle Hill, that whatever life might bring, he still would have been a marine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His early time in the Marine Corps Reserve allowed him to earn money to pay for classes at Delta College, where he studied premedicine. Other activities Corporal Esckelson enjoyed were hunting with his father, David, and brother, Craig, as well as spending time with his girlfriend, Samantha Reasner, who last saw him when she drove him to the airport when he left for basic training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His last contact with his family came 2 days before Christmas 2006 when he left on a 5-day mission which would ultimately be his last.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For his heroism, Corporal Christopher E. Esckelson deserves our recognition and thanks. Designating this postal facility in Vassar, Michigan, where his mother works will allow all who enter the post office the unique opportunity to be mindful of the sacrifices brave young soldiers like Christopher have made and continue to make today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the entire Michigan delegation for their support on this legislation, and urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing this legislation.</paragraph>
