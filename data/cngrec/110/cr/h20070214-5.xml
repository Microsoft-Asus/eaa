  <speaking speaker="400441" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have Pastor Carl Toti with us today delivering the opening invocation for the United States House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pastor Toti currently serves as the senior pastor of Trinity Church in my hometown of Lubbock, Texas. He is a graduate of Rhema Bible Training Center. He has also earned a master's degree in theological studies from Vision University in Ramona, California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as Pastor Toti speaks to diverse audiences through his ministry, so does he today speak to a diverse audience here in our Congress. Although Members of this body come from different parts of the country and varying beliefs, I hope his words will unite and guide us all today as we conduct the business of the people of the United States of America.</paragraph>
