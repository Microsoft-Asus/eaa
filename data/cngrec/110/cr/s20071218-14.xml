  <speaking speaker="400357" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me begin by thanking my good friend, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason I rise is to deal with a very important issue that impacts millions of our fellow Americans, and that is all over this country, with the price of home heating oil soaring, people are wondering about how they are going to stay warm this winter. My very fervent hope is that the Congress, both the Senate and the House, will address this issue before we adjourn for the Christmas holidays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, Chairman Harkin, and others for, in fact, adding a significant sum of money--over $400  million--to the Omnibus appropriations bill. This is important, and I appreciate that. I think people all over this country appreciate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, however, this total of $2.6 billion in funding for LIHEAP, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, that so many people, so many elderly people depend upon in order to stay warm in the wintertime, while it is an 18-percent increase from last year, it is still 23 percent below what was provided for LIHEAP just 2 years ago in nominal dollars. Meanwhile, as everybody knows, the cost of home heating fuels has soared. Compared to 2 years ago, heating oil prices are projected to  be 50 percent higher this winter. The price of propane will be 38 percent higher, and electricity prices will be 14 percent higher. These high prices, coupled with the reduction in LIHEAP assistance compared to 2 years ago, mean States will be forced to either reduce the number of people</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two years ago, thanks to the leadership of Senator Snowe and many other Senators, LIHEAP funding was increased by $1 billion above the appropriated level because it was then the belief that we faced a home heating emergency. Well, if we faced a home heating emergency at that point, let me tell my colleagues we face one today that is even more severe. In the State of Vermont and all over this country, we are having elderly people living on fixed incomes who are looking at the soaring  prices of home heating fuels. They are scared to death. It seems to me that we have the moral responsibility as the Senate of the United States of America to do something for those people before we adjourn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague, Senator Leahy from Vermont, as well as Senators COLEMAN, KLOBUCHAR, SNOWE, OBAMA, DOLE, BAUCUS, SUNUNU, CANTWELL, COLLINS, CASEY, LIEBERMAN, LANDRIEU, KERRY, KENNEDY, and CLINTON for supporting an amendment that will essentially increase LIHEAP funding by $800 million, half of which will go into the normal LIHEAP formula, half will go into emergency funding to be used at the discretion of the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While those Senators are already onboard, I know there are many other Senators--Republicans, Democrats, and Independents--who are also wanting a vote to show the people back home that we have not forgotten them and that we do not want any Americans to go cold this winter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me simply conclude by suggesting to you that the people of our country all over America are losing faith in the U.S. Government. That is no secret. Polling for the President, polling for Congress is at an almost all-time low. They think we are concerned about a whole lot of issues, but we are not concerned about them. It seems to me that before we go home to our well-heated homes, before we go home to our vacation time, that we not turn our backs on some of those who are most in need. I think  we have to act boldly to restore faith in the U.S. Government, and I hope that before we leave, we can get a vote on this floor with bipartisan support, and that we can move this process forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, with that, I thank my good friend, Senator Byrd, the outstanding leader of our Appropriations Committee, for yielding, and I yield back the remainder of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia has the floor, but would he yield me at least a couple minutes in reference to what my colleague from Vermont just spoke about?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes, Mr. President. I am glad to do so.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. I agree with what the Senator from Vermont has just said. In our State, cold weather is not a rarity, it is a fact of life, especially this time of the year. The thermometer on my front steps goes down to 20 below zero. Many times there is no mercury showing because it has gone below that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, that is not theoretical cold, that is cold you die from. I know what it has cost us in filling the tank for my own furnace this year, and I wonder how many people who are not privileged to have the kind of salaries all of us do, how they possibly do it. It is not a matter of just help; this is a matter of life or death. It is not a matter of just comfort. We are not talking about the weather being in the fifties and perhaps you can just put on more sweaters or more coats; we are talking  about it being 5 or 10 and 15 and 20 degrees below zero, or even today in Burlington, VT, it began at zero. The temperature was at zero, and then it warmed up from last night. In those situations you die if you don't have heat. It is not a question of being comfortable; you die. It is as simple as that. You die. There are a lot of people who cannot afford this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will work with the distinguished Senator from Vermont, as I have with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, in trying to get more money after this bill is passed for LIHEAP. I know the distinguished Senator from West Virginia has supported us every single time on LIHEAP. He also knows what it is like in those rural areas of West Virginia where people barely eke out a living and what happens to them when the snow is falling and it is cold outside and the children are crying because they  are cold and the parents are doing everything possible to keep them warm. We will work on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator from West Virginia for yielding me the time.</paragraph>
