  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (<bill type="hr" number="126">H. Res. 126</bill>) commending the University of Southern California Trojan football team for its victory in the 2007 Rose Bowl.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) and the gentleman from California (Mr. McKeon) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to congratulate the University of Southern California for their victory in the 2007 Rose Bowl.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On New Year's Day, college football fans, student athletes and the Nation were treated to an exceptional college bowl game. And no matter what team you support, it is always a thrill to watch the Rose Bowl.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Southern California made history by appearing in its fifth consecutive Bowl Championship Series game and defeated the Michigan Wolverines by a score of 32-18.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to extend my congratulations to the coaching staff, administration, and most of all to the student athletes and fans for winning the Rose Bowl.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to extend my congratulations to the Michigan Wolverines and their student athletes for a great season. Winning the Rose Bowl has brought national acclaim to a university that already has a rich history as the oldest private research university in the West. USC also lays claim as the birthplace of important Internet technologies and has the only marching band in the United States of America that has earned a platinum record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, once again, I congratulate the University of Southern California for their success in winning the Rose Bowl, and also for their great educational tradition. I urge passage of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 126. This resolution recognizes the University of Southern California football team for yet another great season, winning the PAC-10 conference as well as their dominating 32-18 victory over the University of Michigan in the granddaddy of them all, the Rose Bowl.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>USC has put together one of the best coaching staffs in the country, and this game was proof. Early in the second half, Michigan had made it clear to USC that they could not establish the run. Now, former USC offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin said, "We're not running the ball for another play." And for the next 30 plays USC took to the air, rushing the ball only twice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ability of Coach Carroll and his coaching staff to change the game plan mid-game and make personnel adjustments is what separates USC from the rest of the country every year, and led them to their Rose Bowl victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, when you hear about USC winning the Rose Bowl and finishing the season as the fourth best team in the country, it doesn't sound like too much of an accomplishment, that is until you look at this team and see that they lost two Heisman trophy winners, six key pieces in their offense in the first three rounds of the NFL draft, and lost 11 players overall to the NFL before the season began.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my congratulations to Head Coach Pete Carroll, his coaching staff, and every one of the dedicated players, the fans, and to the University of Southern California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am happy to join in honoring this exceptional team and also of its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as she might consume to the gentlelady from California, Representative DIANE WATSON. </paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise today to commend the University of Southern California, located in my district, Trojan football team for its victory in the 2007 Rose Bowl. The Trojans' Rose Bowl victory puts an exclamation mark on a successful 2006-2007 season as well as years of unparalleled Trojan football excellence. Let me cite just a few examples of the football team's long list of accomplishments:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The USC Trojan football team achieved its fifth consecutive AP top 4 finish. Its appearance in the 2007 Rose Bowl marked an unprecedented fifth consecutive Bowl Championship Series bid. The team won an unprecedented fifth consecutive PAC-10 Conference championship. It maintained a top 10 ranking in the AP College Football Poll for the past 56 editions. And the football team won 56 of its last 60 games.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is noteworthy that the USC Trojan football team accomplished these feats while playing the second most difficult schedule in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The victory of the USC Trojan football team also exemplifies the excellence of the University of Southern California as not only an athletic powerhouse but also an academic institution of higher learning. USC has established itself as a leader in the fields of communications, media, the sciences, as well as the arts. It is home to one of the best, if not the best, schools of film in the United States. It also boasts a world-renowned school of music.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>USC is the oldest private research university in the West and is a critical part of the 33rd Congressional District of California. It is home to 33,000 students, 3,100 faculty, and 7,900 employees. It is the largest private employer in the City of Los Angeles. Its physicians serve more than 1 million patients a year. Its Educational Opportunity Programs Center has provided academic enrichment and support services to thousands of neighborhood residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, Mr. Speaker, I commend both the University of Southern California's football team for its victory in the 2007 Rose Bowl; its coach, Pete Carroll; its athletic director, Mike Garrett; as well as the coaches, students, alumni, and staff who were instrumental in USC's Rose Bowl victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I just need to add this: I want to also commend the University of Southern California and its president, Steven B. Sample, for taking in 130 students from New Orleans when their university had flooded. And they not only allowed them to come there and admitted them, but they gave them room and board at a time of great need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So USC and its president have played a major role in the continuous success of the University of Southern California; the City of Los Angeles; and the people of the Golden State, California.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am happy that Ms. Watson talked about all the other accomplishments of SC while I just talked about the football team. The football team was great, but it is nice to see that they are doing all of these other wonderful things, and I commend them for it. I urge our colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I agree with the ranking member. It does sound like Ms. Watson is quite proud of the University of Southern California. As a matter of fact, I want to take this opportunity also to thank her and the University of Southern California for hosting one of our State of the African American Male conferences that I had the opportunity to attend with her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is indeed a great institution, not only in terms of its athletic prowess but also in terms of its scholarship and academic tradition. I urge support for this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="126">H. Res. 126</bill>, as authored by my fellow Californian, Mrs. Watson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an alumnus of the University of Southern California, I've had the pleasure of watching our football teams compete against some of the best teams in the country over the years. The recent record of success is undeniable, which is why I'm happy to offer my support of my alma matter and this Resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year's Rose Bowl included USC playing against a University of Michigan football team that was nationally ranked at number three in the country. The Wolverines, though laden with their own star-power, were simply unable to match the combined efforts of the Trojans on New Year's Day in January.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The players on offense for USC displayed one reason why the Trojans were ranked so highly at the end of the season, even while playing what was one of the most difficult schedules of any collegiate team in the country. Our offense was led by the tandem of John Booty and Dwayne Jarrett, who helped the Trojans to a second-half burst that was exciting for any USC supporter, young or old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But they were not the only reason for an impressive 32-18 victory; the Trojans defense held the University of Michigan offense to just 14 yards of total rushing, which is no simple feat given the running backs for the Wolverines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Trojans' win in January was part of a recent string of impressive marks, from winning a fifth consecutive Pac-10 Conference Championship to the team winning 56 of its last 60 games. Winning the 2007 Rose Bowl was an excellent way to end the team's season and should remain a motivating factor when this fall rolls around.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm hopeful all of our Members, and yes, even those who attended the University of Michigan, can offer their support of today's resolution that commends USC on its victory. And here's to hoping we can support a similar such Resolution next year.</paragraph>
