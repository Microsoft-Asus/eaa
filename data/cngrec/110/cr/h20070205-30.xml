  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the budget the President unveiled today fails to restore fiscal responsibility and meet the budget priorities of a majority of Americans. Critical to my district is county and rural school funding. We have a half-hearted proposal, the same one rejected out of hand by the Senate last year. Not only half-hearted, but half-funded. It would be only half the money needed to meet the obligations of the Federal Government over the next 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, it is speculatively funded with controversial land sales, while he diverts a stable force of funding from oil and gas revenues to pet projects and tax cuts for rich people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite all that, he fails to deliver on his promise of a balanced budget, and he borrows $1.5 trillion from Social Security and Medicare, jeopardizing those programs. His budget is full of holes like Swiss cheese, but it smells like Limburger.</paragraph>
