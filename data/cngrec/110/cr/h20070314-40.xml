    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman will state it.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am sure you would like to join me in noting that clause 2(a) of rule XX provides that a recorded vote by electronic device shall not be held open for the sole purpose of reversing the outcome of such vote. On the previous question vote, Rollcall Vote No. 145, I would hope that you would agree that at the expiration of time for this vote the noes were prevailing. Is that true?</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is correct that that particular clause says that a vote may not be held open for the sole purpose of changing an outcome.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Further parliamentary inquiry.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman may state his inquiry.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Could the Speaker tell me when an instance of the vote being held open would reverse the outcome if it is not when the "nays" are prevailing against the "yeas," or the "yeas" prevailing against the "nays," and the majority wants the outcome to be the exact opposite?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair is not going to respond to a hypothetical question.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Sir, that is not a hypothetical.</paragraph>
