    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today we have the opportunity to right a wrong, the President's wrong in vetoing SCHIP reauthorization. Rather than admit that this veto is in error, the Bush administration has embarked on this misinformation campaign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation does not expand SCHIP eligibility. It does not extend coverage to households with incomes up to $83,000 a year. It does not promote government-run health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather, this legislation has targeted uninsured American children living in poverty, children who already qualify for SCHIP but that don't have health care due to a lack of funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most important reforms in this legislation is the creation of an incentive fund, a fund for States to enroll the 4 million children who currently are eligible for the program but are not enrolled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, this legislation phases out the use of SCHIP funds to cover adults. Let's not forget it was the administration who allowed States to put adults into this program. Please, let's get this right. Override this veto.</paragraph>
