  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, refugees come to America fleeing persecution, injustice, torture and even death. During a hearing before the Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support, we heard from one of those refugees. His name was K'Keng, and he fought alongside American forces during the Vietnam war. In fact, he was recruited and trained by our Special Forces. After the U.S. pulled out of Vietnam, he was imprisoned for 6 years as a political prisoner, after which he eventually  made it to the United States as a refugee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He tried working, but the wounds he suffered during the war made that difficult. Based on his disability and the fact that he had almost no other source of income, he began receiving Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, benefits. But those benefits were terminated when he reached a 7-year time limit on SSI on refugees. He is now 75, partially blind, and lives on only a few hundred dollars worth of food stamps every month, as well as assistance from his young son.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 7,000 elderly and disabled refugees have lost their SSI benefits. The Social Security Administration projects another 16,000 will do so over the next few years unless the Congress acts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the beacon of freedom around the world, America can do better than this. While it is true that a refugee may continue to receive SSI if he or she becomes a citizen, a series of obstacles make that transition to citizenship difficult within the 7-year limit of SSI benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, a refugee must live in the United States for at least 5 years before they are eligible to submit an application for citizenship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>A refugee must then confront a lengthy application process which can take up to 3 to 4 years. Backlogs in processing citizenship applications have been caused by a variety of issues, including protracted background checks put in place after September 11 terrorist attacks. There are other barriers to citizenship, such as the continuing impact of the recent annual cap on the number of asylees who may become legal permanent residents, a status which asylees must maintain for 4 years before they  may submit an application for citizenship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, some disabled and elderly refugees encounter difficulties navigating the application process, which includes both an English language and a U.S. civics test.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm pleased to say there is bipartisan support for addressing this issue. The last several budget proposals from the Bush administration have called for an extension in SSI benefits for refugees, and there is a bipartisan bill pending in the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like especially to thank Mr. Weller, the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support, for working with me to forge the bipartisan bill we are now considering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, <bill type="h" number="2608">H.R. 2608</bill>, would generally extend SSI benefits for an additional 2 years for disabled and elderly refugees, asylees and other qualified humanitarian immigrants, including those whose benefits have expired in the recent past. Benefits could be extended for an additional period for those awaiting a decision on pending application for citizenship. These policies would be in effect till 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation completely offsets the cost of the SSI extension for refugees within a provision that will reduce Federal tax refunds to recover unemployment insurance debts due to fraud. The Federal tax refund offset authority already exists to collect unpaid child support, unpaid State taxes and debts owed to the Federal agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill simply says that if a State concludes that a worker has fraudulently received unemployment benefits or a business owner has failed to pay UI taxes based on fraud, the State can seek to receive a portion of any Federal tax refund that the individual may be owed. Before pursuing a tax offset, the State would be required to notify the individual and provide them with at least 60 days to contest the amount being recovered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By catching and reducing fraud in the unemployment insurance system, this provision not only offsets the cost of the SSI extension for refugees, but it also will reduce unemployment taxes on employers. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the legislation will cut payroll taxes by $326 million over the next 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, refugees come to our country fleeing persecution. They reside in our country legally, and those eligible for SSI are disabled, elderly or both. This legislation extends a modest benefit to help them provide for their most basic essentials. The bill will not add one dime to the Federal deficit, and it will even provide a tax cut. Such a combination should ensure broad support for this vital effort to help those most in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400429" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan legislation that we are considering today, the SSI Extension for Elderly and Disabled Refugees Act, increases the amount of time that certain low-income disabled and aged immigrants can continue to receive Supplemental Security Income, SSI benefits, from 7 to 9 years. These are individuals legally allowed in the United States for humanitarian reasons after fleeing persecution and suffering in their own countries. The approximately 28,000 individuals assisted by this legislation  include refugees, asylees and Cuban/Haitian entrants from around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To gain access to permanent eligibility for SSI and all other benefits and freedoms afforded to Americans, legal refugees and asylees are eligible to become U.S. citizens through the naturalization process now administered by the Department of Homeland Security. However, as many Members have heard from constituents, this process does not always move forward in a timely manner for a number of reasons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For instance, a letter I recently received from the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law in Illinois outlines a case in which an elderly Jewish refugee couple from the former Soviet Union working to become citizens encountered problems of lost paperwork and the need to have fingerprints retaken time and time again. A recent Washington Post story noted that as of March of 2007, this spring, nearly 1.3 million individuals were in the Department of Homeland Security citizenship application  backlog, and 330,000 cases were in the FBI background check backlog.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recognizing the likelihood of ongoing issues in the naturalization process, this legislation provides up to one extra year of eligibility, for a total of up to 10 years, for those refugees and asylees needing more time to complete the naturalization process. This is an important provision as it emphasizes the relative temporary nature of SSI eligibility for newly arrived legal refugees and asylees, while encouraging them to pursue citizenship so that they may fully participate in our Nation's  democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As with the other features of this legislation that relate to eligibility for SSI benefits, this provision is effective from fiscal year 2008 through 2010. So a future Congress must reexamine whether these provisions are working as intended, including providing refugees and related individuals who are playing by the rules and applying for citizenship, sufficient time to go through that process without losing access to these important benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These additional SSI benefits are paid for through a provision that will reduce Federal income tax refunds to better recover unemployment benefit overpayments that resulted from fraud. Tax refund offsets already occur for delinquent child support payments and certain other debts owed to the Federal Government, and this simply allows the current process to work in recovering unemployment benefit overpayments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congressional Budget Office estimates this permanent change will more than pay for the additional SSI benefits provided in this bill. This is sound policy and builds on proposals included in recent Bush administration budget proposals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ways and Means Committee, and in particular the Income Security and Family Support Subcommittee, on which I serve as ranking member, has  long been active in developing legislation to combat fraud and abuse involving unemployment and other benefits. I'm pleased to see we are continuing that effort with this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, in 2004, under the leadership of former chairman Wally Herger, we passed provisions to stop the illegal manipulation of State unemployment taxes. We also allowed State unemployment plans to use information in the National Directory of New Hires to help prevent unemployment benefit overpayments. Today's legislation builds on those efforts, and I am proud to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also note that this legislation is supported by a long list of faith-based and other community groups, including many who assist refugees in their efforts to become citizens. That list includes the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, Lutheran Social Services of America, and Catholic Charities USA, among many, many other groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also note I received a letter of support from the Social Security Administration endorsing this bipartisan bill, and I will include the letters of support in the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would also like to recognize the efforts of my friend and colleague, Representative Phil English of Pennsylvania who, among many others, has worked diligently to see that these sorts of changes occur, including by introducing bills to this same goal and effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage all Members to join me in supporting this bipartisan legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>June 28, 2007. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR REPRESENTATIVE, Representing a diverse cross-section of organizations from across the country, we write to you today to ask that you support <bill type="h" number="2608">H.R. 2608</bill>--the "SSI Extension for Elderly and Disabled Refugees Act." This bipartisan bill is a critical lifeline to thousands of elderly and disabled refugees who are about to lose, or have already lost, their Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits due to the arbitrary seven-year time limit to which their eligibility is limited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, introduced by Representatives Jim McDermott (D-7th WA) and Jerry Weller (R-11th IL), Chair and Ranking Member, respectively, of the Ways &amp; Means Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support, will provide a two-year extension of SSI eligibility for elderly and disabled refugees, as well as a provision to cover those who lost benefits prior to enactment of the legislation. The bill will also ensure that refugees who are making efforts to become citizens, but are caught up in the  processing backlogs through no fault of their own, are given additional time to naturalize. <bill type="h" number="2608">H.R. 2608</bill> will provide vital relief to thousands of refugees who have already fallen into extreme destitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The number of people who are losing their life-sustaining SSI benefits, in large part due to delays in the immigration system beyond their control, is climbing. The Social Security Administration currently projects that 50,000 elderly and disabled refugees will face extreme hardship and destitution by 2012 due to the suspension of their SSI benefits. These individuals fled persecution or torture in countries such as Iran, Russia, Iraq, Vietnam and Somalia, and now are too elderly or disabled  to support themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As more and more people begin to reach the end of their seven-year eligibility period, the human impact of this restrictive time limit has become increasingly dire and all the more intolerable. Some will lose health insurance as well, because SSI and Medicaid eligibility are typically linked. Among those who have already lost SSI benefits is a Jewish elderly couple from the former Soviet Union; the husband is deaf and the wife suffers from heart disease. However, this restriction does not affect  only the elderly, as illustrated by the case of a 16-year-old Iranian boy with mental retardation, autism, seizures, and severe macrocephaly who lost his SSI benefits and Medicaid health insurance due to the seven-year time limit. These are only but two of the thousands of heartbreaking stories that we will continue to be confronted with unless Congress acts now to lengthen the insufficient eligibility period for this extremely vulnerable population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The crisis is already upon us. Each and every month, elderly and disabled refugees are losing their lifeline of support. With the exception of West Virginia, no state is left untouched by this arbitrary time limit. Some 4,500 people will lose their SSI benefits in fiscal year 2007 alone. This bill enjoys bipartisan support, builds on similar proposals in recent Bush Administration budgets, and contains a savings provision that will cover the modest cost of the extension. Given the urgency of  the situation and the life-threatening consequences that these individuals face, we strongly urge you to support the passage of <bill type="h" number="2608">H.R. 2608</bill> this year. We are hopeful that Congress will act quickly and decisively to prevent the unnecessary hardship that this already-victimized population stands to suffer. Thank you for your consideration.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>CENTER ON POVERTY LAW,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chicago, IL, June 19, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear Rep. Weller: I write to thank you for the compassionate leadership you have shown in being a chief cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="2608">HR 2608</bill>. This legislation provides relief to elderly and disabled residents of our nation who, having already endured great suffering, hardship and persecution in their native lands, are now, through no fault of their own, faced with destitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been working on this issue for several years, ever since the plight of these elderly and disabled refugees came to light in stories like those of Iosif and Polina Katz, Jewish refugees from the former Soviet Union in their late 60s who fled the Nazi invasion and lived through iron-fisted Soviet rule. ("Older refugees on verge of losing Federal benefits," Chicago Tribune, page A1, Dec. 27, 2003). The Katzes needed to become U.S. citizens by July 1, 2004 or they would he terminated from  SSI. Iosif, whose green card had been delayed for years after immigration officials lost his application, had no chance of meeting this deadline. His wife Polina, whose fingerprints had to be retaken three times, was also representative of the types of government delays over which these vulnerable residents of our nation have no control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks again for your leadership, Rep. Weller, and please let me know if we can be of any assistance in your efforts to address this compelling situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dan Lesser,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington DC, July 10, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear Mr. McCrery: I am writing to provide the Social Security Administration's (SSA) views on <bill type="h" number="2608">H.R. 2608</bill>, the SSI Extension for Elderly and Disabled Refugees Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SSA fully supports an extension of the time period in which refugees, asylees, and certain other humanitarian categories of noncitizens may remain eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) while seeking U.S. citizenship. The current time limit is 7 years, and some aged, blind and disabled individuals have been unable to obtain U.S. citizenship within this time period. The Administration recognizes the daunting challenges refugees have faced in fleeing tyranny, the adjustments they must  make in their resettlement, and their need for additional help in their quest for U.S. citizenship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 2 of <bill type="h" number="2608">H.R. 2608</bill> would amend the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 to permit a 9-year period for SSI eligibility, provide retroactive eligibility for refugees and asylees who previously became ineligible after 7 years, and exempt the general SSI prohibition for refugees and asylees with pending naturalization applications. These changes would be in effect from 2008-2010. This provision is similar to the Administration's proposal for an extension to  8 years that was in the President's budget in FY 2005, FY 2006, FY 2007 and FY 2008. One difference between <bill type="h" number="2608">H.R. 2608</bill> and the Administration's proposal is that the retroactive effect of <bill type="h" number="2608">H.R. 2608</bill> could require SSA to reinstate SSI payments for individuals who have been off</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A similar letter has been sent to the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael J. Astrue,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="SARGENT SHRIVER NATIONAL">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Becerra).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400021" topic="SARGENT SHRIVER NATIONAL">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to join in this bipartisan effort to try to move forward legislation which is not only important but precious to many people in this country who are keen to be American citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2608">H.R. 2608</bill>, the SSI Extension for Elderly and Disabled Refugees Act, is something that won't affect most Americans because most of us don't have to worry about this. But if you are a Russian Jew who was escaping persecution in the former Soviet Union, if you're one of the minority populations in Somalia that escaped the persecution going on there, or if you're a former Yugoslav who was trying to leave the devastation that was occurring in the former Yugoslavian countries that now have become part  of the Balkans and the war that we saw in the Balkans, or if you're an Iraqi Kurd who is trying to escape the ill effects of what was going on during the Saddam Hussein era, then perhaps you'd understand why this is so important, because these are individuals who, because of the good graces of the American people, have an opportunity to start a life here, even at their late stage in life, and have an opportunity to recognize and appreciate our freedoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But for too many of these refugees, that might all come to an end if we don't come to their rescue, because they did not expect that, all of a sudden, because of the massive waiting line there is for people who are applying for citizenship, legal immigrants who are applying for citizenship, that all of a sudden their cut off of SSI benefits would imperil their ability to pay their rent. Or they didn't expect that, all of a sudden, because of the fact that the paperwork was more difficult than  they thought to fill out, or the fee was more expensive than they could afford to pay to be able to become U.S. citizens, that all of a sudden they run out of time with their SSI benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan legislation strikes the right chord. It says, we recognize that you came to this country fleeing persecution, fleeing threats of death, and you're elderly or disabled, or perhaps both, and we need to do something to try to show you that we meant what we said when we were taking you in as refugees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this is legislation that really brings us together, not as Democrats or Republicans, not as urban Members or rural Members, but it brings us together as Americans who recognize there are many people around the world who still look at America as the beacon for the rest of the world. And I hope that what we are able to do here, at no taxpayer expense, no taxpayer expense, is to continue to show the rest of the world that we do extend a hand to those who are facing persecution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to applaud Chairman McDermott and Ranking Member Weller for their great work in putting together a bipartisan bill that should receive the unanimous support of this House.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400429" topic="SARGENT SHRIVER NATIONAL">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. English), a member of the House Ways and Means Committee and someone who has led on this issue as a member of the Ways and Means Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400123" topic="SARGENT SHRIVER NATIONAL">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2608">H.R. 2608</bill>, the SSI Extension for Elderly and Disabled Refugees Act; and I was particularly pleased to cosponsor this legislation. And I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in supporting it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the United States has been a welcoming Nation to individuals and families fleeing oppression and tyranny in their own country. Repeatedly we've opened our doors to refugees  from places like Nazi Germany, Stalin's Soviet Union, Cuba, China and Vietnam. And more recently, we've taken in dissidents from African dictatorships, Islamic theocracies, the Balkans, Latin America's strongmen, and nations suffering from near total anarchy. We've not  discriminated at any time according to race, religion or politics. We have simply asked refugees to demonstrate that they would face violence or oppression at home for any of these reasons, and then made them welcome here in a new home. This is an important part of the American tradition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, refugees often arrive in this country with severe health problems or advanced age. Many of them have spent time in prison or in re-education camps. Some, like the Hmong tribesmen who testified before our subcommittee, have shed their own blood in defense of American values or foreign policy and have been severely punished by their own governments for doing so. Often these health problems leave refugees with limited job prospects or ability to gain the skills necessary to compete  for employment. This is particularly true of elderly refugees who may have difficulty learning English.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the chairman and ranking member have explained at length, under current law, these refugees lose their eligibility for SSI benefits, which is often their primary source of income, after they've lived in the United States for 7 years, unless they become citizens. Unfortunately, between the now infamous bureaucracy at the State Department, the difficulties of learning English, and a cap on green cards for refugees, many of these individuals are unable, through no fault of their own, to complete  the immigration process in the required 7 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we did not welcome these refugees to our shores only to see them starve in our streets, nor should we impose the burden of their support on local governments or private sector nonprofit organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I am extremely proud that many of these individuals have chosen to make their new homes in northwestern Pennsylvania, particularly my hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania, which enjoys a national reputation for welcoming refugees. But our local communities have very limited resources with which to assist large numbers of low-income refugees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2608">H.R. 2608</bill> wisely recognizes the Federal nature of our obligation to help these people build a new life. It is compassionate yet responsible legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in a "yes" vote.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="SARGENT SHRIVER NATIONAL">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, once again, I want to thank Mr. Weller.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will include in the Record documents relating to this legislation, including a letter from the Commissioner of Social Security articulating the need for this bill and an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office, which highlights the fact that this bill is completely paid for. In fact, it actually reduces the deficit by nearly $50 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, July 10, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing to provide the Social Security Administration's (SSA) views on <bill type="h" number="2608">H.R. 2608</bill>, the SSI Extension for Elderly and Disabled Refugees Act.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>A similar letter has been sent to Representative McCrery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael J. Astrue,</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400387" topic="SARGENT SHRIVER NATIONAL">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of assisting immigrants who Congress invited to live in the United States because they were being persecuted in their home countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Refugees arrive in this country with little more than the clothes on their backs. They often have no family in the United States. For those immigrants who are elderly or have disabilities and cannot work, their sole source of income is often the meager benefits--typically around $600 per month--provided by the SSI program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under draconian provisions of 1996's so-called "Welfare Reform" law, refugess and asylees can only receive SSI benefits for a maximum of 7 years. To date, this law has caused more than 12,000 elderly and disabled humanitarian immigrants to lose their benefits and face hunger and homelessness. The Social Security Administration has estimated that an additional 40,000 individuals will be terminated from assistance in the next 10 years if the law is not changed. Leaving immigrants, who have suffered  so much and come to the United States in search of protection, destitute with no means of support is unconscienable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Current law assumes that refugees and asylees can complete the lengthy and expensive citizenship process within 7 years and continue receiving benefits. For most refugees there is a mandatory 5-year waiting period before they can even apply for citizenship. With application backlogs that regularly near 1 million, becoming naturalized within 7 years is a longshot at best. Acquiring the skills needed to pass the citizenship test, such as English language proficiency, may be impossible for immigrants  with severe disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SSI Extension for Elderly and Disabled Refugees Act (<bill type="h" number="2608">H.R. 2608</bill>) takes the common sense and compassionate approach of temporarily extending the time limit by 2 years. This will provide relief to thousands of individuals facing the loss of their sole source of support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this bill is the best we can do given the present fiscal environment, we should move toward completely removing the time limits. Doing so would bring us into compliance with International Conventions requiring nations to accord lawful refugees the same access to public benefits that they allow their own citizens. In addition, it would build on our Nation's tradition of opening our borders to immigrants escaping persecution and suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important bill, but I hope everyone recognizes that this bill only represents a partial fix.</paragraph>
