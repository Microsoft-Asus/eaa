    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Domestic Violence Month. During the month of October, I urge my fellow colleagues and Americans to join me in committing to end violence in our homes. It is my hope that we can stand together this month and show abusers that we will not tolerate their actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must never forget that domestic violence is a wide spread ailment with devastating implications. Domestic violence affects not only the victims of abuse, but their families and communities as well. The consequences of domestic abuse do not end with the violence. Victims lucky enough to escape their abusers are sometimes left with no home, no money, and no means to support themselves. And most unfortunately, children are often caught in middle of this tragedy. With as many as three million  women experiencing abuse a year, it is clear we must do more to prevent these crimes and help those who are victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I would like to recognize several organizations that have done extraordinary work to protect the victims of domestic violence in Nevada. For almost 20 years, the Shade Tree has provided shelter to abused women, and their families. Now, Shade Tree has taken on another aspect of domestic violence. On October 9, 2007, Shade Tree opened Noah's Animal House, a shelter for the animals of battered women. Shade Tree realized that animal abuse occurs in 85 percent of homes from which battered  women arrive. Of those, 20 percent refuse to leave their abusers without their pets. Shade Tree's commitment to ending domestic violence knows no boundaries, and I know its impact on countless lives will continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Safe Nest is another important organization that has made tremendous strides in ending domestic violence in Nevada. Safe Nest recognizes the importance of addressing all sides of domestic violence and helps with a range of services from court advocacy to crisis intervention. Safe Nest also serves Nevada by sheltering victims and educating the public. On October 19, Safe Nest will hold its annual Domestic Violence Awareness Month luncheon. On this day, I hope that Nevada and our Nation will  recognize Safe Nest's years of success and hard work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would like to recognize the S.A.F.E--Stop Abuse in the Family Environment--House for their work. S.A.F.E. House is a community based organization that provides counseling, advocacy, and intervention for victims of domestic abuse. In addition, S.A.F.E. House collaborates with organizations across Nevada to search for ways to end domestic violence. For example, on October 25, S.A.F.E. House and the state chapter of National Organization for Women will team up to bring awareness to domestic  violence. I am pleased to commend S.A.F.E. House for motivating hundreds of Nevadans to take action in their community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also important to recognize thousands of other organizations in Nevada and our Nation that have committed time, labor, and financial resources to help victims of domestic abuse. Please join me in commending the dedicated efforts of those individuals who work each day to stop aggression in our homes. With their example in mind, I hope that Congress can reflect and take action during this important month. I urge all Americans to participate in Domestic Violence Month activities and pledge  to make this issue their own.</paragraph>
