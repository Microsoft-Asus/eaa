  <narrative>VETO OF SCHIP -- (Senate - October 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12696">S12696</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yesterday, the President vetoed the State Children's Health Insurance Program expansion that the Congress had sent to him, as he said he would. I would hope all of us would get down to work on the serious matter of trying to come up with a compromise which would achieve the original intent of Congress when we passed the legislation back in 1997 and when it was signed into law by President Clinton and which has served the Nation's children so well. Instead, it appears you can't take  the politics out of politics and you can't take the politics out of Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This matter has become a political football that is going to be used for partisan political gain. I think that is a shame. I say that not with a sense of anger but with a sense of disappointment that we would see something as important as providing health coverage to our Nation's children be used in political ads and that rather than have a veto-override vote in the House of Representatives forthwith, it has now been postponed by Speaker Pelosi to October 18 to give the Democratic Congressional  Campaign Committee time to run ads against those who would likely uphold the veto in their congressional districts over the next week or so. That is a shame. I wish they would reconsider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem, after all, with the bill Congress passed is that while the State Children's Health Insurance Program was designed to take up where Medicaid left off, this was fundamentally a welfare benefit, one which I believe the Congress wisely decided was necessary for our Nation's poor, low-income children, to make sure they got access to health coverage. But what we see is this vehicle was then used, with a 140-percent increase in Federal spending, to take this program not just from children  up to 200 percent of poverty but to then say this can be a wealth transfer from the pockets of the American taxpayers to the middle class because under the bill the President vetoed, up to 400 percent of poverty level could be covered by this welfare benefit. That translates to a family of four roughly making $80,000 a year. It is simply unacceptable, from my perspective, to say that you can take money from the pockets of the American taxpayer not for</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my own State, I wish we would redouble our efforts to focus our vision on the original intent of the SCHIP legislation because in my State, there are roughly 500,000 Medicaid-eligible children who are not covered by Medicaid. Why? Because their parents haven't signed them up for benefits they are entitled to under the law. There are an additional 200,000 SCHIP-eligible children, up to 200 percent of poverty level in Texas, who are not signed up for that benefit. So why in the world, when there  are still children in the target population we are trying to help who remain uncovered, are we going to be diverted by a huge expansion of this program beyond its original intent to cover adults in 14 States? In the State of Wisconsin, more adults than children are covered by the State Children's Health</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If possible, I would say this was the equivalent of mission creep for the U.S. military. It is clearly another example of trying to use a successful Government program, a welfare benefit for low-income kids, and to expand it beyond recognition--another example, I am afraid, of wasteful Washington spending run amok.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question is not whether the State Children's Health Insurance Program will continue. Even after the President's veto, as my colleagues know, we passed a continuing resolution which would continue the current program through November 16. I know today that if we had an opportunity to vote on a continuation of the current program as targeted, it would pass unanimously in the Senate. But rather than take care of business, rather than do our jobs, unfortunately this has degenerated into political  gamesmanship, where the House leadership, Speaker Pelosi and others, have decided that rather than have the vote on the override of the President's veto, which they know will be sustained, immediately they have decided to put it off until October 18 in order for the political games to continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obviously, this is another reason Congress's approval rating in most public opinion polls is well under 20 percent. The American people wonder why is it that Washington is not hearing what they are saying when it comes to being good stewards of the taxpayers' dollars, when it comes to making sure the money we do spend that they earn and which is transferred to the U.S. Treasury is spent efficiently and effectively on important programs we all support as opposed to these programs being used essentially  as a Trojan horse for other objectives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final concern I have about this vast expansion of the SCHIP program--a 140-percent increase over the current program--is it clearly represents another step toward a Washington-controlled health care system, something I think would be a tragedy for our country. Eventually, it would crowd out the private sector and the choice and the individual decisionmaking Americans can make with their own health care provider to determine what is in their best interest, what kind of treatment they want  to have for their health care needs, as opposed to turning that over to Government bureaucrats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are three things I can guarantee will happen when Washington makes all the health care decisions. No. 1 is, it will be expensive. It will not be free, or I should say you would be surprised at how expensive "free" health care turns out to be in terms of the tax payments that will be required to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, I will tell you that a Washington-controlled health care system will be excessively bureaucratic. It is just in the nature of Washington. With central Government control for 300 million people, there will be more red tape than anybody can imagine. It will make it harder to get access to the health care that right now is readily available for virtually all Americans. The question is, how are we going to deliver it the most efficiently, not whether they can get access to it. Because we  all agree they should have and do have access to health care today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third thing I will say is, I will guarantee once Washington makes all health care decisions, it will be controlled by rationing. The costs of health care delivery--when Washington makes all the decisions--will be controlled by rationing. What is the evidence of that? Well, if you look right now at the reimbursement rates Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP provide to  health care providers, who provide health care services under those programs, those reimbursement  rates are much lower than private health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where I live in Austin, TX, only 18 percent of physicians are accepting new Medicare patients. Why? It is because the reimbursement rates set by the Federal Government are so low that most doctors cannot treat new Medicare patients and keep their doors open for other business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So if we continue down this road to a single-payer, Government-run health care system out of Washington, DC, it will be expensive, it will be bureaucratic, and it will result in rationing such as citizens of Canada and the United Kingdom currently have with their single-payer system, where the kinds of access to health care we take for granted in this country--and we can get in a matter of hours or a matter of days, at most--they have to wait months and years because of the rationing resulting  from a single-payer, Government-run health care system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the wrong prescription for the American people. I believe once they begin to realize this radical expansion of this program--which has a very important target audience of 200 percent of poverty, poor kids--has now been blown up into something that hardly anybody would recognize, covering middle-class Americans, resulting in a vast wealth transfer from the taxpayers to the middle class--and that it is not just a welfare benefit, but an incremental step toward a single-payer, Washington-controlled  health care system--I think that would be the wrong prescription for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes talking about this issue of health care and children's health care, the issue about all the politics that are involved, and the issue about the next election and how you can make somebody look bad because they do not agree that we ought to transfer a large segment of our health care to the Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is most important that the American people ought to be asking some questions. Why is it we have a health care program that we are putting out that the President rightly vetoed that pays $4,000 to buy $2,300 worth of care? It is a simple question. We are going to pay $1,700 more than we should to run it through the Government--to buy $2,300 worth of care. That makes no sense. But whoever said Washington makes sense?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a matter of fact, this bill is more nonsensical than any bill we have passed this year. It assumes that 22 million Americans now have to start smoking to pay the taxes that will pay for this bill. Twenty-two million? Right now we have a problem with the cost of tobacco use in this country and long-term care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other situation which has not been characterized is, if you look at the CBO scoring, for any one new child who goes on SCHIP under this bill, one comes off of private insurance. It is one for one. That is what the CBO says. So what we are doing is, we are asking the American taxpayers--but, actually, we are not. We are asking the very children whom we are supposedly going to give care to, to allow us to borrow money now to pay for their care so they can pay a higher tax rate 25 years from  now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill lacks integrity in terms of the way it pays for itself. Everybody knows that. It is another little wink and nod from Washington: Yes, we have a pay-go rule. Yes, we are going to pay for it. But, oh, by the way, it costs $121 billion, but we are only going to tell you it costs $35 billion. And, by the way, we don't have the tax revenues to pay for it, so we are going to lie about the tax revenues on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that Washington start getting what America has already got; that is, how about some plain words that have to do with our health care situation? If we want to move to national health care, let's have a debate about national health care. Let's talk about the fact that in England the average length of time waiting for treatment for a cancer after it is diagnosed--they are trying to move from 10 months to 3 months. In this country it is 4 weeks. It is 4 weeks. The cure rates for cancers  in this country are 50 percent to 100 percent better than anywhere else that has a nationalized health care system. Why is that? Why is it that 80 percent of all the innovation in health care in terms of new medical products, new techniques, new devices, new diagnostics come out of this country's private sector?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's have a real debate about national health care. But let's quit lying to the American people that in the name of children we are going to spend their future money to create a segue to national health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the State of New Jersey, well over half the money for children's health care is spent on adults. In the State of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Florida, 750,000 kids under 200 percent of the poverty level are not on SCHIP right now. In the State of Texas, 700,000 are not. Yet we are going to create a system to raise--it is important the American people know what 200 percent of the poverty level is. It is $42,000 a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are saying under the present SCHIP bill--the one that has been extended with the CR--is if you as a family make less than that, we are going to help you out with your kids. But if you make more than that, you ought to be contributing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This body does not care about kids because it voted against a premium support amendment to allow kids in these higher income families a way to buy health insurance. What we have said is no, we cannot do that. But we can certainly be dishonest about what our intentions are in the rest of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as the American public hears all the criticism of those who say: We don't want more Government; we want less; we want the Government we have to be more efficient, more transparent, and more accountable--as they criticize us for those positions, they are going to say we don't care about children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do you care about children if you are going to steal their future by undermining their ability to have a future by not paying for and growing the Government and borrowing more and more money? It cannot happen. We cannot give our children a future if we continue to be dishonest with ourselves and dishonest with the American public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think President Bush is right on this issue. No. I don't think so. I know he is. One of the reasons we are having difficulty at this time in our country with health care is because 52 percent of the health care now is run by the Government. Why is it a large percentage of people who are now coming on to Medicare--and in 3 years the baby boomers start coming on to Medicare--why is it the vast majority of them cannot find a Medicare physician? Why is that? Could it be that we have promised something  we are not going to pay for, so we are going to reimburse at a lower level?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next thing to come out of this body will be: If you are a physician in this country, you have to take Medicare, just as in Massachusetts you have to take Medicaid. Our health care system ought to be about freedom and choice and personal responsibility, and, yes, it ought to be about helping those who need our help. But, quite frankly, if you are making $80,000 a year in this country, we ought to be about paying off debt rather than paying for your child's health insurance. That is what this  bill does. That is what this bill allows.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are going to have a debate. We are going to see the political games played out. This bill will not be overridden in the House, and then we are going to have to come back and address it. My hope is when we address it, we will add premium support for those who are on the edge so we can help those who are in private insurance stay in private insurance, we will be honest on how we pay for it. The most disappointing thing about this bill is the lack of integrity and honesty and character in  terms of the way it is paid for. It shows the depths of which we fool ourselves and play the game of politics rather than play the game of statesmanship. It is a disappointing aspect, and I would say our approval rating is well earned just on the basis of this bill.</paragraph>
