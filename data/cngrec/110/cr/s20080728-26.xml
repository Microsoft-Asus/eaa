  <speaking speaker="412251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the accomplishments of Jim Magagna, 2008 inductee into the Wyoming Agricultural Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim Magagna has spent much of his life fighting for Wyoming agriculture interests at the local, regional and national level. A third generation sheep rancher from southwest Wyoming, Jim is the president and manager of Magagna Bros, Inc.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim has a long history of service to Wyoming's ranchers and farmers. He has served as president for agricultural groups including the Wyoming Wool Growers Association and the National  Public Lands Council. He now serves as the executive vice president of the 135-year-old Wyoming Stock Growers Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of many noteworthy efforts, Jim directed the implementation of the Wyoming Stock Growers Agricultural Land Trust. The trust provides farmers and ranchers with conservation opportunities to remain productive and independent. Jim's dedication to the interests of Wyoming agriculture has created a legacy that will serve Wyoming well for decades to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to honor Jim Magagna, a true Wyoming cowboy. He continues to uphold one of the most trusted, respected, and revered ways of life in America.</paragraph>
