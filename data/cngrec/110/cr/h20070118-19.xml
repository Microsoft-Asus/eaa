    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would like to yield 1 minute to the distinguished chairwoman of the Rules Committee, Ms. Slaughter.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Thank you very much. I appreciate your yielding to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me confess off the top, it is true, I committed an act of honesty in the Rules Committee, something we hadn't seen in over 12 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also explained at the time that rules <bill type="h" number="5">H.R. 5</bill> and <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> were coming up under the point of privilege with which we started this session.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are working on an agenda that the minority would not or could not do and we are fulfilling our promise to the American people, and all the whining you can do and all that you can produce will not deter us from it. The majority is pleased and gratified by the minority votes on all of these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought I heard a faint chorus yesterday after the bill on student loans was passed, I thought I heard someone singing, Free at last. Free at last.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obviously, helping the majority to do these bills for the American people has not been any too painful for you. But these have not been addressed for 12 years. We said that we were going to. It was under the beginning rule of the personal privilege. There was nothing amiss there; we were simply being honest.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished Republican whip.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am here in opposition to this rule. I don't feel as strongly about the bill because I don't really think the bill is a serious piece of legislation. I don't think it addresses the issues that need to be addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the fact that this bill has come to the floor without going to committee, without any opportunity for debate, without the freshmen Members having any opportunity to ever be part of anything except one vote today is truly outrageous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This should be the premier issue for this Congress. Energy independence and all of that affects everything we are, everything we do as a people. It affects foreign policy, it affects our international situation in so many ways, it affects the economy, it affects the environment. And here we are with a bill today that hopefully is just checking off the list and we really get back to serious discussions of energy legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, energy independence is critically important, and it is not going to be achieved in this bill in this  way. This bill does take a problem, a problem that was created in 1998 and 1999, a problem that was created when the Secretary of the Interior failed to put in a contract, what the laws that we passed clearly allowed the Secretary of the Interior to do. It didn't happen later, it didn't happen in 2000, it never happened in the current administration.  It was a problem. It is a problem in a contract. Whether that is worth 3 hours of debate on the House floor or not, I don't know. I do know that contracts are normally dealt with in a court of law, not on the floor of the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a problem that was created by a past administration that needs to be clarified, but is so far off base from what we ought to be talking about today. We ought to be talking about energy independence for the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This rule doesn't allow us to have that kind of debate because the process didn't allow that kind of debate. I guess we are going to be told later today that we are at the end of the 100 hours, which is an interesting calculation in and of itself. And maybe when we will get to the end of the 100 hours, we can get this checklist. I wondered for some time why we didn't have an agenda that would last 100 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Since Franklin Roosevelt that has sort of been a mark of the work of the Congress. I have really decided there is not enough work here to do for 100 days, but these 100 hours are checking a list off that will not produce legislation that results in anything happening. At the end of the day today we hopefully can move on to the real business of this Congress, none of it more important than energy independence. This doesn't solve that problem, doesn't even take a significant step in solving that  problem.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400263" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me emphasize once again that Chairman Rahall, in his testimony before the Rules Committee 2 days ago, said that this was the first step, that there are a lot more issues that we need to address as a Congress to achieve our goal of energy independence, and we are going to do that. What we are doing today really is responding to the outcry of the American people who are outraged by the fact that in the midst of being gouged by Big Oil, the previous  Congress decided to pass a bill to provide billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks to those very companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with that, Mr. Speaker, let me yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Hall).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412222" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that I find it amusing to be lectured about energy independence and working hard to get things done from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who for the last 6 years could have solved these problems, but instead watched us sink further into dependence on foreign and polluting sources of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In April 2005, President Bush was quoted as saying, "With oil at more than $50 a barrel, energy companies do not need taxpayer incentives to explore for oil and gas." Then, even as prices went higher, he and the Republican Congress went ahead and gave them a goodie bag of taxpayer subsidies. Gas prices topped $3 per gallon, Big Oil made record profits of $97 billion, and record dependence on foreign oil still leaves us vulnerable to the whims of unfriendly regimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we are going to take back the tax giveaways to Big Oil so we can give the American people a break at the pump, a breath of fresh air, and a more secure nation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished ranking member of the Rules Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. DREIER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400115" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I obviously join my colleagues, rising in strong opposition to this closed rule, which did not allow for any kind of deliberation whatsoever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to begin by saying that I am somewhat troubled at the fact that we continue to see this pattern of name calling from the other side of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We recognize that we have begun a new Congress. I am very proud, as a Californian, that we have the first Californian and the first woman Speaker of the House of Representatives. I am very proud of that fact and I think it is a great thing. I am proud that our State has been able to do that. And she is the first Italian American Speaker of the House of Representative, and she always likes to state that, and I congratulate her for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we need to, as members of the minority, give the benefit of the doubt to this new majority. It has been 12 years since they have been in the majority, and I think we should provide an opportunity for people to understand their new roles in this institution. But I have to say that while we have continued to have name calling--and the distinguished chair of the Rules Committee has just said that for the last 12 years the Rules Committee was dishonest. I don't know exactly what that means.  I am very proud of the record that we have had the last 12 years in the majority in the Rules Committee, and I am proud of the fact that we have been able to put together strong policies to encourage economic growth in this country, we have been able to ensure that we have not had an attack on our soil since September 11. These kinds of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to say, Mr. Speaker, that we are at a point right now where it is important for us to recognize that it is not about what we did, it is about what the new majority promised they were going to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the distinguished Republican leader stood here and talked about the fact that we have, over the past several days, gone through this process right now; it has been under a closed rule. Yes, Speaker Pelosi announced there would be no opportunity for debate and discussion through the regular order process. So that was an announcement that was made. As the Republican leader said, the Chair of the Rules Committee announced before the process even began that we were going to have closed  rules on both the education bill and on this energy bill. I have to say that it is a troubling indication because it is 180 degrees from what was promised by the new majority when they were in the midst of their campaign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to also say, Mr. Speaker, I heard the gentleman from Massachusetts get up and congratulate our friend from Miami for having supported a couple of the items. I am proud that I have supported a number of these items. I think something important to note is that at least half of the items in the Six for `06 were voted on and passed by the Republican Congress. Stem cell research, in a bipartisan way, passed. It would not have come to the floor had the Republican leadership not seen fit to bring  it to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the issue of the minimum wage, we brought to the House floor, Mr. Speaker, the issue of increasing the minimum wage. We simply said that we should recognize that those who create jobs might want to have the wherewithal to pay those people the minimum wage. And so we had a vote on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earmark reform. We are very proud of the fact that last fall we passed very broad-sweeping earmark reform that enjoyed bipartisan support here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we are doing in many ways on this Six for `06, Mr. Speaker, is simply voting again on initiatives that passed in a Republican Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also have to say that we passed lots of energy legislation in the past, and we have been able to see a reduction in oil costs. Oil prices are dropping right now. We continue to see that, and that is because of the fact that we want to encourage alternative sources and attaining domestic energy self-sufficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think it is just important for us to take a moment to look at this issue of fairness and balance and recognize that we do want to work in a bipartisan way, but the issue of this name calling I think should come to an end, and let's try to look to the future rather than the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule, and the underlying legislation, H.R.  6, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007. I am a firm believer that Congress should do everything possible to address the Nation's energy needs and reduce our dependence on foreign oil while still protecting the environment and maintaining reasonable energy prices. I believe, however, that this bill falls short of fulfilling this responsibility. Not only that, the Democrats  have shut out any hope of fixing the bill's problems by reporting a closed rule for <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The basis of this bill is very simple--it raises taxes on domestic oil producers and then turns around and spends that money to subsidize ethanol, solar energy, and windmills. In the process, Democrats also want to tell the market how to work. Common sense would tell us that if you increase the cost of domestic oil production by $10 billion, you are ensuring that U.S. imports of foreign oil will rise and domestic production will fall. These are basic market principles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consumers want affordable gas prices, Mr. Speaker, and unfortunately this bill does nothing to lower them. Raising taxes on firms in the oil and gas industries does nothing to lower the price of a barrel of oil. We all know that numerous factors affect gas prices--Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and OPEC members in the Middle East, for example. These are complex domestic and international market factors that are hard if not impossible to control. The Democrats are apparently oblivious to this reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also understand that this bill would raise $5 to $6 billion in revenue by removing the tax breaks provided to the oil companies in the 2005 energy bill. But in fact, the Congressional Research Service has reported that the net impact of the 2005 energy bill was an increase in taxes to the oil and gas industry by some $300 million. So how will removing this provision help raise revenues? Furthermore, as Members of Congress, we want to enable companies to take every step forward in the exploration  of domestic sources of oil and natural gas. It is counterintuitive to take away incentives for companies to participate in this exploration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats talk about keeping America competitive, yet this legislation would impact a domestic company's eligibility to remain competitive with foreign manufacturers by repealing a 2004 tax provision that reduced the effective corporate income tax rate to 32 percent from 35 percent. Why would we deliberately put American producers at a disadvantage with their foreign competitors?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Included in this piece of legislation, which, I will remind my colleagues, did not receive any committee consideration in the 110th Congress, are provisions for a trust fund for alternative fuels. The Democrats say this trust fund money, created by funneling the revenue from abolishing crucial tax incentives and the tightening of royalty regulations, will accelerate the use of clean energy resources and alternative fuels and promote the research and development of renewable energy technologies.  This trust fund is an idea that's been heralded by Members on both sides of the aisle. And the objectives that I just mentioned are surely noble ones. However, this bill creates a trust fund and then ends there. There is no mention in the bill as to how this new revenue is to be spent, just suggestions. In this respect, this is a bill with good intentions but no teeth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we are not arguing that more time and money deserves to be spent on the development of alternative energy. It should. In fact, studies have shown that between 2004 and 2006, investment in alternative energy doubled to $63 billion. And the market is responding. Venture capital funding of green-energy technologies has quadrupled since 1998. Members of Congress have submitted numerous amendments to <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> mirroring these efforts. The Rules Committee received almost 20 amendments with  thoughtful suggestions as to how to direct trust fund money, and other productive approaches to solving our energy needs. Not one amendment, Mr. Speaker, was made in order. In fact, even before the Rules Committee had heard testimony from any of the amendment sponsors, Chairwoman SLAUGHTER announced that she would be granting a closed rule. The Democrats had already made up their minds and closed their ears before they even heard the first amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> was referred to four committees. In another instance in denying the due process and minority rights that Democrats promised the American people, those committees never once met on the bill at hand. Members on both sides of the aisle never had the chance to draft, review or amend the bill. The Democrats campaigned on honesty and openness, and heralded a new era in minority rights, but again have failed to live up to their promises. Again, they completely ignored regular order  and pushed this bill to the front of the line, and the deficiencies in the bill are evident because of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, once again, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have missed yet another opportunity today to craft comprehensive legislation that would address issues that are important to the energy debate. During the 109th Congress, we worked with Members on both sides of the aisle on legislation that increased refinery capacity. This legislation received strong bipartisan support, and yet is noticeably absent from this legislation we have before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is just like Proposition 87--the 2006 ballot initiative that would have taxed California's home-produced oil in order to subsidize "green technology" alternatives. Thankfully those in my home state were smart enough to defeat Proposition 87, knowing full well it would have damaged California's home oil and gas industry, increased foreign oil consumption, and raised the energy bills of the state's residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill raises taxes and raises prices at the pump. And all the American people are getting in return is a promise that we'll actually do something down the road. The new majority is well on its way to fulfilling another empty promise and at the expense of the American consumer. Let's vote down this rule, and force the majority to take this bill through committee where we can have a real energy bill with real solutions.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400263" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the distinguished former chairman of the Rules Committee and the distinguished minority whip have made it clear that they are not impressed with the first 100 hours of this Congress, but the American people are and, quite frankly, that is what counts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this point I would like to yield 1 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch), who is a member of the Rules Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the issue for us in this Congress is procedure, but it is really about substance. In the last Congress, what happened was something that you can't make up. Oil companies have enjoyed $125 billion in profits over 3 years, were the beneficiaries of legislation that lowered taxes for them by about $14 billion. You can't make it up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this legislation is about is addressing that and for the first time taking a step in the direction of providing incentives for what every American knows is long overdue, and that is to provide incentives for alternative energy opportunities. We need that to strengthen our economy and create good jobs; we need that to strengthen our position in foreign policy so that we are independent; and we also need it to begin addressing global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is the beginning, it is only a beginning. There is going to be an enormous amount of time for the committees to take up the large issues and for us together to take the broader steps that are required to become truly independent on energy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Nunes).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400297" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to go to the Rules Committee the other evening. Of course it was after the distinguished Rules Committee chairwoman said that they weren't going to accept any of our amendments or a substitute. I made a comment at that point that I was essentially wasting my time in the committee, which is unfortunate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we have an opportunity to debate in front of the American people what should be an important policy about energy independence, but this bill doesn't do anything like that, Mr. Speaker. All this bill does is get back at the oil companies. We had many members of the Rules Committee say essentially that it was vengeance. They didn't use the word "vengeance," but essentially I believe that that was the point that they were making because they are putting up a facade that this bill actually  does something to lower energy prices to the American people. In fact, all this does is roll back some tax cuts, specifically takes out oil and gas for domestic producers, does nothing to the Middle East producers, and now we are basically going to be left with a bill that isn't going to go anywhere. The majority knows it is not going to go anywhere, and that doesn't even include the process that we have gone through to get this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier one of the speakers--I forget who said it--for the majority side said that the Republicans crafted their energy bills in the backrooms. Well, I would ask the majority if the backrooms included the subcommittees and the full committees, like the normal process that this Congress is supposed to go through where we have full committee debate, we have a bill introduced, we have debate on the bills.  Maybe that was the backrooms that you guys were referring  to on the other side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this case, you essentially had a few staff people in the Speaker's office write up a bill. Then they put out a facade that this is going to lower the gas prices to Americans and lower energy costs and be the bridge to the next renewable energy trust fund that they are going to create.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is interesting in the last Congress we had a bipartisan bill that did put money into a trust fund, but you know what we did? We went out and I said, let's take our resources that we have, like in Alaska, let's go and drill in ANWR. Let's put those royalties into a trust fund, and then we can bridge ourselves into the next generation of energy. That is good energy policy. Taxing small domestic oil producers in America is only hurting American-made energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am frustrated not only by the policy that has been put out here as an end-all-be-all perfect solution to America's energy solutions, which it is not, but I am even more frustrated--and I normally don't come down here to speak on rules, but I had to come down here and speak on this rule because I was in the Rules Committee the other night and I wasted my time, and everyone in that committee wasted their time because the Rules Committee chairwoman said, before we even met, that she was not going  to accept any amendments or even a substitute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is frustrating. I hope that the majority will live up to their promise to the American people and will have full open and honest debate.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400263" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me just respond to the gentleman from California by saying to him that I appreciated him being in the Rules Committee. I thought his testimony was very thoughtful, and I look forward to his engagement in a lot of these issues as, again, the chairman of the Resources Committee said, this is the beginning, not the end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to point out one thing to him so he understands one thing, and that is, in the last year, when the Republicans were in control of the Congress, there were 34 rules provided to bills that were not reported out of committee. I point that out not to make a partisan point, but simply to kind of illuminate him on the fact that there were a lot of bills that no one ever saw before they came before the Rules Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlelady from Florida, a member of the Rules Committee, Ms. Castor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, instead of giving away billions of dollars to big oil companies which made multibillion-dollar profits last year, the new Congress intends to chart a course in a new direction by investing in alternatives for the American people. This will help America become energy independent and ultimately lower the utility cost for average Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Big Oil has held too much sway in the halls of Congress in past years. They even targeted drilling off of Florida's beautiful coastline, putting our tourism industry at risk. The Bush administration refused to get serious about a sensible and sustainable energy policy, even after President Bush proclaimed last year that our country is addicted to foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people understand that what we really need is a far-sighted plan for energy independence, and they did vote for change. The new Democratic Congress will plan for a more sustainable future, independent of foreign oil entanglements that interfere with our foreign policy. The new Democratic Congress will encourage conservation and development of alternative fuels which in turn will lessen our dependence on polluting fossil fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my own district, the University of South Florida has developed initiatives at its Clean Energy Research Center to develop and promote new sources of alternative energy, and we can do more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So let's take the first step together today and then commit to launching a broad new energy strategy for future generations.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding and, Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Energy Policy Act, or EPACT, the first comprehensive energy package enacted with bipartisan support in well over a decade. I supported it for one reason, because it made a much needed and sustained investment in the basic science and applied energy research that will end our reliance on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress and the Federal Government must make a steadfast commitment to support the development of advanced energy technologies and alternative fuels that will help end our addiction to oil and gasoline. That is why in the 109th Congress I introduced <bill type="h" number="6203">H.R. 6203</bill>, the Alternative Energy Research and Development Act. This bill reflected the latest research, the emergence of innovative technologies, and new ways of thinking about our power problems. Among other things, it supported the development  of biofuels, solar and wind power, and battery technologies. It also promoted energy conservation in a number of important ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill received bipartisan support from the Science Committee. It was approved unanimously by this body in September of last year, but the other body, on the other side of the rotunda, failed to act on it before Congress adjourned. So why aren't these widely supported provisions included in the bill we are considering today? Good question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I tried to offer an amendment to include provisions from <bill type="h" number="6203">H.R. 6203</bill> in this bill. I went to the Rules Committee to explain my amendment and how it might contribute to our energy independence. But before I could speak, a decision had already been made by the Democratic leadership not to allow any amendments to this bill, not even those whose provisions had been passed unanimously just 4 months ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So how does this bill contribute to our energy independence, Mr. Speaker? I supported fixing the Clinton administration oil and gas leasing errors, but I believe we are missing the opportunity to take the next step. We should know where the money will go. Instead of creating a slush fund, as this bill does, for some unknown use in the indefinite future, we should take the steps today to invest in the kind of research, development, and demonstration projects outlined in <bill type="h" number="6203">H.R. 6203</bill> that will ultimately  lead to advanced energy technologies. We need to start today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are serious about energy independence, we should put that money to work today as an incentive for consumers to become more energy efficient and use alternative fuels. This could be accomplished by extending and expanding the tax credits created in EPACT for the purchase of vehicles that run on alternative fuels. Let us lift the cap on the number of vehicles that can qualify for these credits. Let us expand incentives for the installation of alternative refueling infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I introduced another bill in the last Congress that would do just that by using the revenue generated from repealing certain tax credits for oil and gas production. These are the kind of concrete initiatives that will bring us measurably closer to achieving true energy independence. These are the kind of worthy initiatives we should consider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will have to support this bill, I guess, but I think it could be better, so much better, and that is why I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 1 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Hodes).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412220" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts, for yielding me time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and in strong support of the underlying bill, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my State, New Hampshire, is a State known for its pragmatism. The energy crisis that this country faces is no mystery to my constituents. They see our independence on foreign energy sources, they see our climate changing, and they see the tax breaks for Big Oil while their own resources are stretched thin. They have  seen roller-coaster high prices at the pumps, giveaways to Big Oil, and those same Big Oil companies reporting record profits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This should not be a Democratic or Republican issue because it is a common sense issue. And the bill we will consider today is a commonsense and much needed start to solving the problem. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> would repeal the billions of dollars in subsidies given to Big Oil in the ill-conceived 2005 energy bill and reinvest those funds in clean renewable energy and energy efficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would require oil companies to pay their fair share in royalties, and would close glaring loopholes in the Tax Code. More importantly, Mr. Speaker, this bill would create a Strategic Renewable Energy Reserve to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit in this country, to jump-start our investment in renewable and alternative energy resources, and to promote conservation and the development of critical new technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Energy independence is an issue of national security, it is an issue of jobs, and it is an environmental imperative. No issue is more important to our future or our children's future. Mr. Speaker, I am exceedingly proud of this new majority's 100-hour agenda, but I am perhaps most proud and most ardently supportive of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to invest in a new energy policy, and I encourage my colleagues to support this rule and support <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my distinguished friend from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400313" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding, and salute my colleagues for working at a concept really that we all agree on: Energy independence. I refer only to the second title in these comments, where I oppose the rule which says there will be no amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title II is the one where the Washington Post says "This House bill would break its deadlock by imposing heavy penalties on firms that do not renegotiate on terms imposed by the government." They go on to say, "This heavy handed attack on the stability of contracts would be welcomed in Russia and Bolivia."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's look at just a couple of things that have occurred recently. In 2005, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez mandated private oil firms to cooperate with new contractual changes, much as we are doing in section 2. The investment from foreign firms, which is vital for Chavez's economic plan to succeed, are already being curtailed due to the uncertain investment environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, Bolivia threatened to expel oil companies that refused to agree to new terms on existing contracts. These actions were done for short-term increases in revenue, yet they are leading to massive economic problems in the country through the oil and gas industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, in Russia, 2006, companies such as Shell, Exxon, and BP have held valid oil and gas leases for years, yet Putin has declared that the agencies are going to pull these leases for a number of suspect reasons. In section 2, title II, we have those same sorts of heavy handed approaches that the Washington Post editorial complains about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our colleagues have said that President Bush refused to get serious. If getting serious is undermining the full faith and credit of this government, then I will agree that President Bush failed to get serious.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had also heard a comment from one of my distinguished colleagues on the other side that this agenda includes things that the minority would not do, and I will agree the minority would not do those things which undermine the contractual basis of this government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this bill should be back in committee to have the hearing and the amendments that would occur, because you know that these things are not valid and will not promote more production from U.S. companies but less.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400438" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the Rules Committee for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of this rule. I am a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I watched 2 years ago as my Republican colleagues larded up the Energy Policy Act. While we were trying to talk about energy efficiency and we were trying to talk about energy conservation, they were giving over $8 billion in tax breaks to the oil and gas companies, the companies that are making huge profits right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this bill does is roll back that tax break as well as require the oil and gas companies to pay appropriate royalties to the government, appropriate royalties to the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is looking forward. I am afraid my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are looking backwards. They are still talking about oil and gas. We on the Democrat side, however, get it. We understand that, yes, we are using oil and gas today, but we are also running out of oil and gas in the world and in this country and that we must have alternative energy sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what do we do? We say, let's take this unnecessary tax break of $8 billion and let's collect our royalties and let's put that money in a trust fund to develop alternative energy, renewable energy that can last us well into the latter part of this century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, personally, I am very enthusiastic about hydrogen fuel cell development because hydrogen fuel cell development definitely leads us down the road to energy independence. Hydrogen fuel cells don't have any emissions; they don't leave any emissions. Hydrogen fuel cells aren't dependent on foreign countries. It is a technology we can develop here in this country that will really make us energy independent and will also address the problem of global warming. But we must invest in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let's not look backwards and give oil and gas companies more tax breaks. Let's look forward and invest in renewable energy, in hydrogen, in wind and solar, and the things we have in this country that can make us truly independent. I urge adoption of this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400655" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I appreciate the chairwoman's honesty earlier about the fact this was going to be a closed rule. We listened for 2 years about the whining on closed rules and the fact that it reflected a closed mind. So on our side, for the next 2 years, we will try to keep our whining to a minimum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Words are inflammatory. Title I to this act says "Ending Subsidies for Big Oil Act of 2007." I have a title I would like to put on title II of section 1, and that would be the "Congressional Abrogation of Contracts Using Blackmail Act of 2007." We can throw these wild words around at each other all we want to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I speak against the rule and the process. This is staff-developed underlying legislation. Not one Member of Congress had any input into it at a point in time where you could actually do something about it. There are flaws throughout it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offered an amendment yesterday, which turned out to be for no good reason, that would simply say if you are in fact going to hamper domestic production of crude oil, and clearly in the near term increased domestic production is a way to get us to the point where we are no longer as dependent on foreign oil, if this act works to hamper that, then it wouldn't take effect. In other words, get the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of the Interior to tell us this won't have a negative effect  on oil production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other amendment I offered would simply say if you are taking those profits, whether you consider them obscene or not, if you are taking those profits and putting them back in the ground to find additional sources of domestic crude oil and natural gas, then this act wouldn't apply. Evidence shows the small oil companies, to which the tax provisions affect, not just Big Oil but it affects the small companies, those small E&amp;P companies reinvest 617 percent of their profits back in the ground  finding additional supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is flawed in its mechanics, and I will speak later this afternoon against the underlying concepts, but one of the flaws is, if I am an owner of one of those covered leases and I sell it to somebody else and am no longer in the loop, I am still covered and tainted with that until everybody else in that loop subjugates themselves to this  American government and renegotiates those contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The price threshold mechanism is flawed. At 34.73 a barrel there is no threshold, yet at 34.75, I have a $9 pop, which means I am only really making $25 a barrel. These are the kind of things that, had it gone through committee, or I guess it did. Oh, it did not go through committee, that is right. This came straight to the floor without any input from anywhere else. Whether you agree with our positions or not, your closed mind on this issue is clearly evident in this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My only caution is, and we have heard we are coming to the end of this railroad train, that the other side has now become so intoxicated with the power and authority that they have being in the majority, that they do not continue to misuse that power and authority and continue to ignore open debate and honest ideas and an exchange of honest ideas that the committee process typically allows and that brings better legislation to this floor and helps us address these things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The consequence of the taint may be intended. I don't think it is, but we ought to know that. And there is no real way to know that without debate within the committee structure where there is adequate time to go at this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I urge my colleagues to vote against this closed-minded rule, a little bit of whining just to keep up appearances, to vote against this rule, and I will speak against the underlying bill later this afternoon.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400253" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill today is a historic bill. What it is going to do is to reclaim billions of dollars, the GAO says upwards of $10 billion, which will then be moved over from unnecessary tax breaks and royalty relief for oil and gas companies, and moved over to a Strategic Renewable and Energy Efficiency Reserve so that we can change the direction of energy in our country by just taking back that which is undeserved in tax breaks and royalty relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, what's the issue? Well, the issue is that back in 1998 and 1999 the oil industry received royalty breaks that didn't require them to pay any royalties back to the American people, the American taxpayer, as they drilled on the public lands of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this bill does is it gives a choice to the oil and gas industry: either renegotiate those leases or pay a fee going forward for the drilling on those lands. And that money will then go into a trust fund for renewables, for energy conservation, for ethanol, so that we can move in a new energy direction for the 21st century. It is a quite simple formula.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the royalty relief, the change in how royalties are collected, it has already passed here on the House floor. But it was then blocked by the Bush administration. The $9 fee was the Pombo amendment. That has already passed on the House floor. So we are not talking about things that haven't already been debated. We are not talking about things that have already passed. What we are talking about are things that the Bush administration then blocked from becoming law. And what the Democrats are  adding is just that it be put into a renewable and a conservation and ethanol trust fund so that we can move this country into a new energy direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that this rule passes, and then I hope that we have an overwhelming vote, as we have had twice before in the past, by the way, on this royalty issue by all Members of the House, so that we can finally move in a new direction for the 21st century in energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the bill that we will consider later today represents the important first step in charting a new direction for the Nation's energy policy. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007, which repeals the unnecessary and wasteful tax breaks and royalty-free drilling rights for big oil and gas companies, and instead creates a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve that would invest in clean, renewable energy sources and clean alternative fuels like ethanol, as well as energy efficiency  and conservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> will put an end to oil companies drilling for free on public land no matter how high oil prices climb. The Government Accountability Office has estimated that the American taxpayers stand to lose at least $10 billion from leases issued in the late '90s that do not suspend so-called royalty relief. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> would correct this problem by barring companies from purchasing new leases unless they had either renegotiated their existing faulty leases or agreed to pay a fee on the production of  oil and gas from those leases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House has already adopted the royalty relief fixes included in <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> by overwhelming, bipartisan votes. By a vote of 252-165, the House adopted the Markey-Hinchey amendment to the Interior appropriations bill to provide a strong incentive for these companies to renegotiate. The House also voted last year to impose a $9 per barrel fee on oil produced from these leases in a bill authored by former Resources Chairman Pombo. Both those provisions are in <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>. So two times this House has said  that we want to put real pressure to renegotiate on all the oil and gas companies holding those 1998-1999 leases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the Bush administration has consistently opposed our efforts to bring every oil company holding one of these leases back to the negotiating table and it continues to oppose the provisions in <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> that would do so. Instead, the Bush administration has argued that we should allow oil companies to "voluntarily" renegotiate with the Minerals Management Service. However, of the 56 companies holding these leases, only 5 have voluntarily agreed to renegotiate. When billions of taxpayer  dollars are at stake, that is simply not an acceptable rate of return. This bill says that it's time for the oil companies to stop playing Uncle Sam for Uncle Sucker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passage of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> will allow us to begin to move in a new, clean direction on energy and put an end to the free ride that big oil has had under the Bush administration. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> represents the beginning of a change in direction, away from subsidizing industries that don't need extra financial incentives, and towards the technologies that do need a helping hand and I urge its adoption.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>For 12 years, Mr. Speaker, I have engaged in an energy brain trust that would hopefully engage the industry but help to reform the industry. And so I say to my colleagues, today we are making that first step, not ignoring the industry, but opening our doors to engagement and discussion so that we can truly have a reformed energy industry that focuses on energy independence and security for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we realize in 1998 and 1999 the price per barrel for oil was very low. And the administration, at that time, reasonably addressed the question of royalty relief. Today we have a different economic structure, and the price per barrel is $50-plus and up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so what is this Congress and this leadership doing? It is doing the right thing. It is making a determination that we can now place some $14 billion in trust to support clean alternative energy and, of course, renewables, renewables and alternative energy that have been proposed by Members on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to an engagement of the energy industry so that it can diversify its own portfolio. It is necessary for our independence from foreign oil, and it is necessary for our homeland security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what we do not do in this bill is important. For example, we do not repeal refinery expansion expensing. We don't repeal the intangible drilling cost deduction, nor do we impose a windfall profits tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are balanced. We are respectful of this process of engagement, and we don't repeal the natural gas line depreciation or the foreign tax credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so we understand that the industry, one, has to work to ensure that it is productive and that it moves away from total dependence on foreign oil to give relief to the American people as they proceed to develop greater energy independence and conservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good bill that focuses, in a balanced way, to begin the march toward energy reformation and opens the door towards new ideas for the energy industry that will allow energy independence and security for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, which will create long-term energy alternatives for the Nation. The Creating Long-Term Energy Alternatives for the Nation, CLEAN, Act of 2007, includes two components that will roll back the unnecessary tax  benefits and costly federal oil and gas leasing provisions included in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The legislation would also help to correct the mistakes of the leases issued by the Interior Department  between 1998 and 1999--which, if left unchanged, could cost the Federal Treasury an estimated $60 billion over the next 25 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CLEAN Act calls for investing in clean, renewable energy by repealing $14 billion in subsidies given to Big Oil companies by requiring these companies which were awarded 1998 and 1999 leases for drilling without price thresholds to pay royalties or pay a fee. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> also eliminates unnecessary tax deductions which exist in the tax code and in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. In the first ten years, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that these fees will generate $6 billion in revenue  and the Joint Commission on Taxation estimates that the elimination of these deductions will result in $7.6 billion in revenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CLEAN Act also creates a Strategic Renewable Energy Reserve which would promote energy efficiency by investing in clean, renewable energy and alternative fuels, promote new energy technologies, develop greater efficiency, and improve energy conservation. We cannot justifiably continue to allow big oil companies to reap astronomical financial benefits while the citizens of this country continue to struggle to pay their living expenses due to the outrageous cost of oil and gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These high costs derive primarily from our overwhelming dependence on foreign oil. The Energy Information Administration estimates that the United States imports nearly 60 percent of the oil it consumes. Moreover, the world's greatest petroleum reserves reside in regions of high geopolitical risk, including 57 percent of which are in the Persian Gulf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we cannot even remotely begin to reduce the high price of oil and gas which has caused many of our citizens to change their standards of living, unless and until we find ways to create a more self-sufficient energy environment within the United States. Investing in clean, renewable energy is an important first step to achieving this goal. For example, an innovative solution to our national energy crisis is in the 21st Century Energy Independence Act, which I introduced in the 110th  Congress. This legislation alleviates our dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels by utilizing loan guarantees to promote the development of traditional and cellulosic ethanol technology. Investing in domestic alternatives such as traditional and cellulosic ethanol can not only help reduce the $180 billion that oil contributes to our annual trade deficit, but it can also end our addiction to foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Department of Agriculture, biomass can displace 30 percent of our Nation's petroleum consumption. In addition to ensuring access to more abundant sources of energy, replacing petroleum use with ethanol will help reduce U.S. carbon emissions, which are otherwise expected to increase by 80 percent by 2025. Cellulosic ethanol can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 87 percent. Thus, transitioning from foreign oil to ethanol will protect our environment from dangerous carbon  and greenhouse gas emissions. Cellulosic ethanol technology requires initial governmental</paragraph>
    <paragraph>investment and policy support to achieve the necessary scale to become self-sufficient and gain market-penetrating capacity. That is why I introduced the 21st Century Energy Independence Act since it ensures that America achieves energy independence and improves our environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to being from the energy capital of the world, for the past twelve years I have been the Co-Chair of the Energy Taskforce of the Congressional Black Caucus. During this time, I have hosted a variety of energy braintrusts, panels, conferences, and symposia designed to bring in all of the relevant players ranging from environmentalists to producers of energy from a variety of sectors including coal, electric, natural gas, nuclear, oil, and alternative energy sources as well as energy  producers from West Africa. Bringing together thoughtful yet disparate voices to engage each other on the issue of energy independence has resulted in the beginning of a transformative dialectic which can ultimately result in reforming our energy industry to the extent that we as a Nation achieve energy security and energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CLEAN Act strikes energy bill provisions suspending royalty fees from oil and gas companies operating in certain deep waters of Gulf of Mexico. The bill also repeals royalty relief for deep gas wells leased in shallow waters of the western and central areas of the Gulf. It includes a provision from the President's FY 2007 budget restoring drilling permit application cost recovery fees; fees which the 2005 Energy bill prohibited. The measure also strikes royalty relief for specific offshore  drilling in Alaska, and special treatment for leases in the National Petroleum Reserve--Alaska (NPR-A).</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> requires companies, which unfortunately have been able to escape paying royalties as a result of the 1998 and 1999 leases, to pay their fair share in order to be eligible for new federal leases for drilling. Specifically, the measure requires current offshore fuel producers who are not paying federal royalties to either: (1) Agree to pay royalties when fuel prices reach certain thresholds, $34.73 per barrel for oil and $4.34 per million Btu for natural gas, or (2) to pay new fees established  in the bill--in order to be eligible for new federal leases for drilling. Under the bill, a new conservation of resource fee would be based on the amount of oil produced and will apply to new and existing leases and shall be set at $9 per barrel for oil and $1.25 per million Btu for gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The changes regarding royalties offered under <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> are not entirely new. Similar royalty relief provisions have been debated and passed by the House as part of the OCS drilling bill, <bill type="h" number="4761">H.R. 4761</bill>, and in the Interior Appropriation bill with bipartisan support of 67 Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> would also close gaping loopholes and end gigantic giveaways for Big Oil in the tax code and in the 2005 Energy bill. The bill would eliminate a loophole written into the international tax bill, <bill type="h" number="4520">H.R. 4520</bill>, which allowed oil companies to qualify for a tax provision intended to encourage domestic manufacturing. According to the New York Times, this loophole provided ConocoPhillips $106 million in 2005, even though its profits totaled $13.5 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The benefits which ConocoPhillips reaped from the tax loophole, represents just a snapshot of the lopsided picture that overwhelmingly favors the financial well-being of big oil companies over average American families. While big oil companies continue to rake in millions and millions of dollars, American families see their budgets shrinking because of high costs of oil and gas. It is our responsibility to refocus our legislative lenses on solving this Nation's energy dependence problem so that  we may rescue American families from the recent oil and gas price hikes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because I represent the city of Houston, the energy capital of the world, I realize that many oil and gas companies provide many jobs for many of my constituents and serve a valuable need. That is why it is crucial that while seeking solutions to secure more energy independence within this country, we must strike a balance that will still support an environment for continued growth in the oil and gas industry, which I might add, creates millions of jobs across the entire country. We have many  more miles to go before we achieve energy independence. Consequently, I am willing, able,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>and eager to continue working with Houston's and our Nation's energy industry to ensure that we are moving expeditiously on the path to crafting an environmentally sound and economically viable energy policy. Furthermore, I think it is imperative that we involve small, minority and women owned, and independent energy companies in this process because they represent some of the hard working Americans and Houstonians who are on the forefront of energy efficient strategies to achieving energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> is a vehicle by which we can drive this country in the direction of energy independence. Under this bill, we can invest in clean, renewable energy resources through the creation of the Strategic Renewable Energy Reserve which would: Accelerate the use of clean domestic renewable energy resources and alternative fuels; promote the utilization of energy-efficient products, practices and conservation; and increase research, development, and deployment of clean renewable energy and energy  efficiency technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is critical that some of the additional funding created by this bill is invested in small, minority and women owned business and minority serving institutions. By investing in minority owned business and minority serving institutions, we are ensuring that sectors of our Nation and economy which are often overlooked are given an opportunity to compete against much larger businesses and institutions of higher learning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the changes we propose to the CLEAN Act will allow us to move this country in the right direction--the direction of becoming less dependent on foreign oil and in turn, more reliant on renewable energy. Because of these changes, we anticipate a win-win situation. These changes should stimulate the expansion of research into renewable energy because such changes positively impact oil companies that choose to reinvest in new and emerging technology. Thus, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> offers great incentives  for oil companies to contribute greatly to our efforts to create an energy-independent America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, the provisions that oil companies care about the most are preserved under the CLEAN Act. In part due to the concerted effort of the Houston/Harris County delegation, this bill WILL NOT include the following provisions: (1) Repeal of last-in-first-out (LIFO) accounting; (2) Refinery expansion expensing repeal; (3) Imposition of a windfall profits tax; (4) Repeal of intangible drilling costs deduction; (5)  Repeal of natural gas distribution lines  depreciation; and (6) Foreign tax credit repeal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all of the foregoing reasons, I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> to create long-term energy alternatives and to create a more energy-independent and secure America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we debate this rule and debate how we are going to debate this rule, an F-16 is burning 25 gallons of fuel every minute. A Stryker combat vehicle on which our troops travel is traveling at the rate of about 7 miles per gallon. I was on a C-17 recently. It is burning 3,000 gallons an hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Energy is a national security issue. It is a vital national security issue. And we can't afford to continue to debate the debate to adjourn this House. The decision before to ask this House to adjourn, I think, is emblematic of failed energy policies. There is no more debating or delaying. It is time to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year the Department of Defense spent $10.6 billion on basic energy costs. Of that, the Air Force spent $4.7 billion on one thing, buying fuel for its planes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I believe in a robust defense. We have got some significant challenges in the world. China is a significant challenge. Iran is a significant challenge. But the policies on energy that we have had for the past 6 years have put us in the position where we are borrowing money from China to fund our defense budgets, to fuel our military, which requires buying oil from the Persian Gulf to protect us from China and the Persian Gulf. How does that make sense? It makes no sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was in China just several weeks ago. They are going to reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent and keep growing, and increase their use of renewables, while we continue to rely on our adversaries to power our military to protect us from our adversaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This dependence on foreign oil, Mr. Speaker, is as glaring a threat to our national security as Sputnik was, as the Cold War was, as the space race was. And our answer to those threats was, we will research and develop and manufacture and engineer and land men on the Moon by the end of the decade. We confronted those threats and beat those threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to quit debating and quit delaying and quit stalling. It is time to put the protection of our troops ahead of the profits of the big oil companies.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons why we are so concerned about and opposed to this process of having closed out all of the Members from bringing forth their ideas to improve this legislation is because we seriously believe that this legislation, as drafted, if it were to become law, would increase our dependence on foreign oil. That is why we are so adamant in our opposition to the unfairness of the process, because of the product that this process has brought  forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will be asking for a "no" vote on the previous question so that we can amend this closed rule and allow the House to consider <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> under a fair and open process. If the previous question is defeated, I will offer an amendment to consider <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> under an open rule. This is the least we can do for the Members of this Congress who have had absolutely no input into this far-reaching piece of legislation, or any other piece of legislation that has been brought to the House floor  so far. By considering this bill under an open rule, Members will be finally afforded an opportunity, for the first time in the 110th Congress, to offer meaningful amendments to this bill. For the new majority it is a novel concept, I know. In fact, it is the very concept, though, on which they campaigned. This vote on the previous</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the official 100-hour clock, and I see the clock there, Mr. Speaker, we are only about 35 hours into the first 100 hours. That means we have approximately 65 hours left. If this is, as we are informed, the last item of the Six in '06, 100 hours in '06, agenda, it seems to me that we have plenty of time to consider this bill under an open and fair rule, rather than closing out all the Members and rushing it to the floor as they have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By defeating the previous question, we will give the Democrats the opportunity to live up to their campaign promises of a more open and transparent legislative process. Let's allow all Members, Mr. Speaker, the opportunity to create a real energy bill with real answers to diminish, not increase, our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Speaker, to insert the text of the amendment and extraneous materials immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400263" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me, first, begin by reiterating something that has been said many times here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the great features of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> is that it would create a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve. It could be used to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Everybody talks about wanting to become energy independent, but they don't want to do anything about it; and this would actually create a reserve to do that, to accelerate the use of clean domestic renewable energy resources and alternative fuels, to promote the utilization of energy-efficient products and practices and conservation,  and to increase research development and deployment of clean renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, this is the beginning of our dealing with this issue. There is a lot more to do. And I look forward to more debates and hearings and more ideas from Members from both sides of the aisle to figure out how we can achieve our goal of energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for participating in the debate today. Over the past 100 hours, this House has made tremendous progress in addressing the needs of the American people. We have strengthened the ethical rules of this House. We have made the homeland safer by adopting the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. We have given low-wage workers a much needed raise. We have embraced the promise of stem cell research. We have made student loans and  prescription drugs more affordable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with the passage of this rule and the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007, we will take our energy policy in a new direction, toward cleaner, renewable energy and away from tax giveaways to huge oil and gas companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you want the same old same old, vote against this rule and vote against the underlying bill. If you want a new direction, then support the rule and support the underlying bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me close with a word about process. I understand the concerns expressed by my friends on the other side of the aisle. I served in the minority party during the last Congress, and I suspect my friends are worried that they will be treated as poorly and disrespectfully as we were.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was here when the Republican majority passed exactly one open rule on a non appropriations bill. I was here when votes were held open for 3 hours to change people's votes. I was here when special interests provisions were tucked into conference reports after they were signed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This House is broken, Mr. Speaker, and the Democratic majority was elected to fix it, and that is what we are going to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All I can tell my friends on the other side of the aisle is what I believe. I believe that every Member of this House deserves to be respected. I believe that one party does not hold a monopoly on good ideas; and I believe that openness should be the rule, and not the exception. And all I can offer my friends is my word that I will work as hard as I possibly can to make sure that this  House runs in a more open, democratic fashion than was the norm over  the past 12 years. We will not be perfect, because human endeavors never are. But we will be better.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are here to take one small and bipartisan step toward making clean renewable energy a reality in America. And imagine my surprise, Big Oil doesn't think it is a good idea. But let's set the stage for this debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two years ago, Big Oil muscled their way into a corporate tax break they had never earned and didn't need. They are siphoning off $1 billion a year right out of the pockets of U.S. taxpayers, and they want it to last forever, right along with $10 billion in quarterly profits that they have been reporting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their answer to everything is more drilling and more money. The President completely agrees. He thinks it is unfair of us to expect Big Oil to actually earn money. He would actually just give it to them. That is what they think; that is what the American people face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a report by the Department of Energy, it is expected that 86 percent of our energy supply will come from oil, coal, and natural gas in the year 2030. That is the same proportion of our energy consumption that carbon provides today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That same report states that we should expect oil, gas, and coal prices to continually climb. In other words, if this country does not pursue a radically different approach to energy, we can expect dirty air, more pain at the pump, and more reliance on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us takes the vital first step in the pursuit of a new energy policy that looks to American innovation to provide renewable energy. This bill is a down payment, and only that, on a commitment to an energy policy that is fitting for the 21st century. The bill before us is fundamentally fair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, the Congress sought to help American manufacturers better compete in the global economy, but in doing so they provided a 10 percent reduction in the Federal taxes owed by Big Oil. That translates into a tax subsidy for over $1 billion a year, a real boondoggle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is more, the Congress gave this subsidy to oil at a time when the industry was enjoying recordbreaking  profits that were resulting from $60 a barrel oil. That is wrong. Today we take the first step back in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we're taking the taxpayer money and putting it to better use. Today the House of Representatives will decide that it's wiser to invest in renewable energy, innovation, and a future for our economy and our planet.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400123" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our friends on the other side of the aisle have proposed a so-called energy bill that they claim will promote America's energy independence. In reality, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats have presented the House Chamber with a placebo that will ultimately reduce domestic energy production, give American energy companies less of a reason to invest in exploration here at home, encourage greater dependence on foreign oil, and damage America's manufacturing base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> has become another political football for the Democratic Party. And, frankly, Mr. Speaker, as The Washington Post rightfully editorialized yesterday, energy policy deserves more serious treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats' solution to America's energy crisis is to single out oil and gas producers for a tax increase. The fact is, Mr. Speaker, this legislation is not likely to impact oil producers' profits in any way, shape, or form. This is energy policy by focus group, not a serious prescription for achieving America's energy future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The one thing that we can be assured that this bill will do is raise prices at the pump for America's consumers. Furthermore, it creates disincentives that will decrease the supply of domestic natural gas and oil and increase our country's energy imports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> not only forces our country to become more dependent on foreign oil, it will also force America's working families to bear the brunt of increased energy costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The $6.6 billion tax increase embedded in this bill will inevitably be borne entirely by consumers in the form of higher gasoline and home energy prices. The effects of high gas prices will ripple throughout the economy, increasing prices on everything from electronics to school supplies. Like the Keystone Kops, the House leadership aims at one target but ends up hitting the American public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In addition, the Democrats have yet to detail what exactly they will do with an additional $14 billion in revenue. In my view, such excess revenue will provide the Democratic leadership with a liberal slush fund to curry favor with one industry over another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Democrats want to invest in new energy technologies, they should debate and define their priorities openly. This, Mr. Speaker, is political pork barrel at its worst.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> is an assault against America's manufacturing base. Using nearly one-third of the Nation's energy, both as fuel and feed stock, energy production is the very heart of American manufacturing. With such an energy-intensive industry, raising energy prices will make domestic manufacturers less competitive in the world market. This is one reason why the National Association of Manufacturers has firmly opposed this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By making the oil and gas industries ineligible for the section 199 deduction for domestic manufacturing activities and changing current amortization rates for the geological and geophysical costs incurred in energy exploration, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> will further erode the U.S. comparative advantage, forcing more and more of our good-paying manufacturing jobs overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have long advocated for a comprehensive energy policy to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and increase America's access to clean, affordable and dependable energy for their cars, homes and businesses. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> is simply not the answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is bad energy policy and bad tax policy which explains why the Democratic leadership shoehorned it through the process without a committee markup or even a single public hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must stand up for American manufacturers, stand up for American consumers, and preserve our domestic energy supply. So I urge my colleagues to join me today in opposing <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> and supporting the Republican alternative.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>After I got done hearing my friend from Pennsylvania speak, I was reminded once again of a recurring theme in this town from Republicans: have they ever met a special interest they didn't love.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The struggles of Big Oil: profits last year of 117 percent. Remember as we heard these arguments just a couple of minutes ago from those champions of the average guy, as they would have you believe today, these are the people who in a craven moment in the closing days of the 109th Congress tied an increase in the minimum wage to repeal of the estate tax, conveniently forgetting about that individual who had to work one day a week at minimum wage just to fill their gasoline tanks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is good policy. It is sensible, and it speaks to the idea of returning $14 billion to the Treasury that will be redirected to renewable and energy-efficient programs resulting in a cleaner and more efficient America where both consumer and business reap the benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Advancing progressive energy will wean us off of foreign oil, which all Americans agree is needed. It has been said that American needs another Manhattan Project, not to create weapons of mass destruction, but to create masses of jobs by harnessing America's technological innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know how many jobs have been lost due to foreign competition, and we are going to continue to lose them if we fail to make the necessary investments in energy technology and the people who are behind the research and its development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Put the American people and their interests first here. The idea that we would drill on public land and not seek some sort of compensation for the Federal Government, relief for the taxpayer, is ridiculous.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today politics trumps policy. If regular order had been followed in this House, allowing this tax increase to go through the Ways and Means Committee, we would have a better understanding of the consequences of today's $14 billion tax increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, if the House of Representatives was subjected to the truth-in-labeling requirement, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> would be called the Ship Jobs Overseas Act because it imposes a $14 billion tax increase on investing in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have all heard the campaign rhetoric; both sides use it: you know, the Tax Code sends jobs overseas. Well today, this House may well do that if it votes to pass this $14 billion tax increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support replacing imported oil with home-grown biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel, as well as alternatives sources of energy like wind power and solar. And thanks to the energy bill we passed in the previous Congress, there are hundreds of millions of dollars in new wind investment in the district I represent, six new ethanol and biodiesel plants moving forward in our districts; and because I am concerned about climate change, I believe we need to do more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I believe 25 percent of our energy that we consume by 2025 should come from nonfossil fuel sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill doesn't do anything about that because <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> only raises taxes. I would note that one of the biggest refineries in America is in the district I represent, providing 600 jobs. That particular company is investing $1 billion right now to expand. They chose to expand in America, creating American jobs. They could have expanded in Venezuela, making Hugo Chavez happy; but they chose to invest here. And what is their reward? Higher taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why this legislation, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, should be called the Ship Jobs Overseas  Act. Think about it, if you invest in energy in America, you invest in oil and natural gas development in America, my friends on the other side of the aisle want you to pay higher taxes. I urge a "no" vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the Creating Long-Term Energy Alternatives for the Nation Act of 2007. I rise in opposition because this bill before us today will make our country more dependent on foreign oil and less secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's pretty safe to say that every Member here supports the goal of reducing our dependence on foreign oil. It's a national security issue and it hits home every single day when people go to the pumps to fill up their vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I agree with the concept of this bill that our Nation must invest in renewable sources of energy like ethanol, biodiesel, wind and solar. In the upcoming weeks I will be introducing multiple pieces of legislation that will increase our use of renewable energy and I look forward to working in a bipartisan way with those in the majority to make some of these ideas a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What really doesn't make sense to me is that, in this bill, the majority do the complete opposite of achieving the goal of reducing our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are going to raise the taxes of oil companies that produce oil here domestically and make it more difficult to produce oil here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district, ExxonMobil has one of the largest domestic refineries in the country, employing approximately 509 people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last 5 years, they have invested more than $500 million in the Joliet Refinery of which about $300 million was for equipment to produce low sulfur gasoline and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2007 and 2008 they plan to invest more than $400 million to install additional control equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, by passing this bill, we are going to be sending the message to companies like Exxon who by 2008 will have invested close to a billion dollars in central Illinois, saying "Thanks for investing in America, now we are going to raise your taxes."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bills just like this here before us today should be labeled "the send jobs overseas act" because that is exactly what it will do. Close to a thousand energy related jobs in my district and the approximately 1.8 million jobs in the U.S. are put in jeopardy now because of this policy that discourages investment in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And who are the big winners of this bill? Leaders like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and OPEC who are watching this and loving the fact that we are passing punitive tax policy on domestic energy producers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the Energy Policy Act of 2005, we took steps forward in reducing our dependence on foreign oil by creating policy that increased the use of renewable energy in tandem with increasing our domestic production of energy sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Due to the Energy bill, we have seen hundreds of millions invested in wind energy and four to five new ethanol and biodiesel plants in my district. In total, we saw investment in renewable energy double in the United States to $68 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to go back to those roots of encouraging investment here in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill makes us less secure and more dependent on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vote against this send jobs overseas act that will raise taxes and discourage investment here in America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Dr. McDermott, the gentleman from Washington, for yielding me this time and bringing this piece of legislation to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the CLEAN Energy Act. More than ever, we need to get our priorities straight. We need to stop helping big oil companies and start helping American families. We need to stop dancing while Rome burns and reverse the damage we have done to our environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oil companies are making record profits. They do not need our help. They are not begging for our help. They made more than $96 billion in profit in 2006. It is time to end the massive giveaway to the big oil companies. It is time to end corporate welfare. It is time to take taxpayer dollars back from the oil companies and use them to solve our energy problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is our moral duty to use other forms of energy, and <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> starts us on this process. Global warming can no longer be ignored. 2006 was one of the hottest years on record. The weather in Washington during the last 2 weeks has felt more like the warm weather I am used to in my home State of Georgia. We need to act now. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> will start to address global warming and turn back the damage we are doing to our environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also need to reduce our reliance on Middle Eastern oil. It is our duty to help inspire the next generation of energy technology: hydrogen, ethanol, wind and other sources of energy that will not harm our little planet, our little spaceship we call Earth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people need relief from energy costs. By improving our energy efficiency, we can all spend less to light and heat our homes and fuel our cars with gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do the oil companies really deserve tax breaks while they earn billions of dollars in profits? It is time to end this waste. It is not right. It is time to start improving our quality of life. The people have a right to know what is in the air we breathe and what is in the water we drink.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege now to yield 3 minutes to a strong advocate of a strong American energy policy, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400077" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the so-called CLEAN Energy Act of 2007. I oppose this bill because in it our Democratic friends are putting America's security and economic vitality at risk. This bill is fundamentally a tax-increasing and job-destroying piece of legislation that will result in less energy independence, not more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are several provisions within this bill that I take exception to. As one of the Representatives from Oklahoma, I would focus on a particularly onerous provision that will assist in the destruction of small American producers in the domestic oil and gas industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, the Republicans worked for and passed legislation with substantial Democratic support creating clear incentives for domestic production of oil. That policy contributes directly to our efforts to achieve energy independence in America. Today, the Democratic Party claims the oil and gas industry has become too profitable and believes this industry needs to be reined in by burdening it with increased taxes. This conclusion is wrong, and the end result will be increased reliance on foreign  oil production, less energy independence here in America, and higher prices for every American consumer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is based on the false premise that the oil and gas industry is too profitable. In fact, according to the Census Bureau and the American Petroleum Institute: "The oil and gas industry earned 8.5 cents on every dollar of sales compared to 7.4 cents for all U.S. manufacturing, mining and wholesale trade." The API further states: "For the last 5 years, the oil and gas industry has earned 5.9 cents compared to an average for all U.S. industry of 5.2 cents for every dollar of sales."  This is hardly greedy or out of line with other U.S. businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the negative ripple effects of this tax on one of the most basic industries in America are dire; and this will affect the whole oil and gas industry, both large and small. Eliminating this tax break is certain to increase the price of gasoline, natural gas and heating oil, as the extra costs will be passed on to consumers. Consumers should oppose it for the same reasons they oppose taxes on imported oil and gas production: it will raise prices. Moreover, it will discourage domestic  energy exploration, extraction, production, and refining, thereby making America more dependent on foreign sources of oil and gas. And it will harm State and local economies as smaller producers are forced to shut down marginal wells. Oklahoma has roughly 70,000 wells producing less than 10 barrels of oil a day, and these will be among the first wells to close down due to unsustainable costs in this tax increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> will have profound and long-lasting harmful effects on our economy and our security. Overall, this bill takes our country in the opposite direction than the one in which we need to go. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> is nothing more than a ploy by the Democratic Party to create political sound bites at  the expense of sound energy policy. Frankly, I hope my Democratic friends from energy-producing States do not feel compelled out of blind partisan loyalty to  vote for this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This bill creates a very important reserve, a reserve that will serve as a funding base for our efforts to significantly expand critical research in order to develop greater energy independence for our country while continuing those tax credits that have been absolutely essential to the growth of renewable fuels in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We face the promise of not looking to the Middle East, but looking to the Middle West for our energy future, and we are seeing across the plains of this country wonderful developments. A 10-fold increase of ethanol production alone in my State is under construction at the present time due essentially to these tax credits that continue to fuel this revolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What about the issues of a new tax, something that will crack people right at the pump. The reality is we are addressing something that was slipped into a massive bill dealing with the tax needs of manufacturers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>As we restructured the tax base on the Nation's manufacturers, in light of international trade pressures, we constructed a bill, moved the bill forward, and at no point in the debate in the Ways and Means Committee or on the floor of the House was there notice provided that a similar tax treatment was slipped in for the oil companies. This is something they did not have before; it is something that has not been long critical to their operations. This was an ill-gotten windfall amounting to $700  million a year, and it is time it be withdrawn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the withdrawing, however, it is not going to the General Treasury. We are dedicating it, dedicating it to the energy picture. So as we try to move from big oil into renewables, we will have the wherewithal to do it. I urge passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is an important step for our growing renewable energy industry. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> will set up a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve, which will allow this Congress to begin to get serious about developing America's renewable energy industries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through enhanced investment in renewable energy we will not only build a sustainable industry for our State but we will also be helping make America more energy independent and more secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be many new proposals made in the coming months regarding how we should use this reserve, but we must make sure that while we place significant funds into research and development we also continue to place importance on policies and tax credits that have an immediate impact on the creation of renewable energy. These tax credits include those for ethanol, biodiesel and the production tax credit for wind and other renewables.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tax credits for biodiesel and ethanol are set to expire in the next few years. These credits must be extended to ensure that the biofuels industry is able to continue its expansion and meet more and more of our transportation fuel needs. These credits helped spur the development of 350 million gallons of ethanol and over 100 million gallons of biodiesel in my State, North Dakota, over the last 2 years alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006 over 1 billion gallons of ethanol production capacity came online with another 5.4 billion expected to become operational in the next 18 months easily surpassing the 7.5 billion gallon Renewable Fuels Standard set for 2012. Meanwhile the biodiesel industry has tripled its production capacity each year since 2004. Expansion of these credits will have a direct effect on the volume of biofuels produced, encouraging the development that we need to lower our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the biofuels incentives, the production tax credit, which expires at the end of next year, must be extended for 5 years to allow industries such as the wind industry to operate under stabile conditions. Without stabilizing the tax credit, companies like DMI Industries in West Fargo and LM Glassfiber in Grand Forks are in constant limbo. DMI manufactures wind turbine towers and had furloughed over 100 employees in late 2003 after the expiration of the wind production tax credit.  LM Glassfiber, which manufactures wind turbine blades, had previously idled all production due to the delay in extending the wind tax credit and was forced to furlough 60 to 70 employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America has great potential for meeting our energy needs domestically. In order to achieve energy independence we must enact policies that will take full advantage of our renewable fuel potential but at the same time we must also continue to invest in traditional sources of energy such as clean coal and domestic oil production. Technologies such as coal-to-liquids, enhanced oil recovery through carbon sequestration and clean coal technologies hold great potential for increasing the efficiency  of these industries while at the same time making them more environmentally friendly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reliance on foreign sources for our energy supply and the volatility of the Middle East create a national security risk that cannot be ignored. We must work to harness our own Nation's energy resources while also bolstering new and inventive methods of meeting our growing energy needs. We are taking an important first step today and I look forward to the debate on renewable energy that will occur in the coming months.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400190" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Before my friend from North Dakota leaves the floor, the bill to which he referenced, he, in fact, along with 72 of his colleagues, voted for. The FSC/ETI bill that actually we are now pulling back that tax reduction. We are repealing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been an interesting 2 weeks, Mr. Speaker. We have now forced small businesses to take on additional labor costs, yet we have done nothing to cushion the blow for the mom and pop stores across the country. Last week, the majority wanted to stick it to those drug companies that develop life-saving miracle drugs, while we all have family members who actually live longer and healthier lives because of those miracle drug therapies. Today, we are considering a tax increase on the domestic energy  companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, how many Members have come to the floor and made speeches and beat their breasts and lamented the loss of the manufacturing base in this country? And it is something we agree with, except that the majority's response then is to tax those very domestic energy producing companies?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me make a prediction, not a bold one, but as we are wrapping up this 6 in 2006, I suspect that the newly elected Speaker will actually be in the Chair as the vote is called, and as the votes are there to pass this measure there will be thunderous applause from one side of the Chamber, with handshakes and back claps all around.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know who else is going to be applauding today's measure? The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Companies, upon whom we are already so dependent. You know who else is going to applaud today's efforts? Another big fan. The dictator from Venezuela.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, of course, there are some on the majority side who have actually called upon Mr. Chavez in Venezuela, visited him during the last Congress, and came back to this country speaking of his benevolence?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Research Service has reported that the net impact of the 2005 energy bill was to actually raise revenue from the domestic oil and gas industry by $300 million. But let not the facts get in the way of good bumper sticker politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge a "no" vote on <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the majority for making it a whole 2 weeks before deciding to raise taxes--34 hours if you are keeping track by the clock on the Speaker's website. It must have been tough to wait this long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've been around here long enough to follow the twists and turns of the FSC/ETI case, and I'm somewhat puzzled by what we are doing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is true that oil and gas companies were not able to claim the previous FSC benefit. It is also true that Chairman RANGEL championed an approach to replace FSC  with a broad benefit targeted at domestic manufacturing. The JOBS bill ultimately provided a broad definition of manufacturing activity to avoid arbitrarily creating winners and losers. Yet today, we find ourselves here picking and choosing among domestic activities, without concern for  the broader policy implications, based solely on the need for the majority's Leadership to put out a splashy press release about getting tough on big oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us provides an insight into the governing philosophy of the new majority. The concern of people in my district--and across the country for that matter--is that we need to maintain an affordable supply of energy by breaking our dependence on foreign oil. By any common-sense measure, domestic exploration must be part of a multi-faceted solution to this problem. So in that regard, it is counter-intuitive to think that tax hikes on U.S. exploration activities will help provide an  affordable, steady supply of gasoline to consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Put another way--most of us took Econ 101 in college. I must admit, it was a few years ago when I took this class, but the way I remember it, if an added cost is put on an industry--in this case a tax--those costs will eventually get passed on to the consumer. And in that regard, I guess the majority's desired policy aim is to make gasoline more expensive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone agrees that we must break our dependence on foreign oil, and I take a backseat to no one when it comes to promoting homegrown renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel as a way to reduce our consumption of petroleum. In fact, had the Rules Committee made my amendments in order, the House could have voted to extend these important incentives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the majority's answer to this problem--tax hikes--is simply misguided, and I urge &#xD0;my colleagues to join me in voting "no" on &#xD0;H.R. 6.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise as a proud conservative and Republican, as well as a cosponsor, to urge support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oil and natural gas are not forever. When we burn them, they are gone. The U.S. has only 2 percent of known oil reserves. We use 25 percent of the world's oil and import two-thirds of what we are using. We pump our reserves four times faster than the rest of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just returned from a trip to China. China is preparing for a post-oil world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are three reasons to pursue renewable alternatives to fossil fuels. One is climate change. A second reason is preparing for peak oil. A third reason is for national security risk of our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As predicted by M. King Hubbert, and ratified by a recent SAIC report, the world either has or will shortly reach peak oil. As a cofounder and cochairman of the Congressional Peak Oil Caucus, I can assure you that halfway through the age of oil, there is an urgent need for the U.S. to pursue conservation efficiency and alternative renewable sources of domestic energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a moral obligation to leave younger generations some oil. I urge support of this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400297" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, would it be correct if I asked about the long title of this bill? Is the long title of this bill, to reduce our Nation's dependency on foreign oil by investing in clean, renewable, and alternative energy resources, promoting new emerging energy technologies, developing greater efficiency, and creating a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve to invest in alternative energy?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> It is a long title, but that is the title of the bill, yes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400297" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to confirm the long title, because it appears today that we are talking about this bill being about energy independence. And earlier, during the rule debate, it was brought up by the distinguished chairwoman of the Rules Committee, who referred to the process that was used under the last Congress, referring to Mr. Dreier's process, as being dishonest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this whole process that we are going through today is about dishonesty, and I want to be clear that I am talking about the process. This is unacceptable to me. Because if this is about energy independence, this bill we are going to pass today, then why is there this quote this morning in the Wall Street Journal, and I will read the quote. "Tomorrow we finish our 100 hours and I will talk about what comes next. And included in that is energy independence."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Pelosi made this statement in the Wall Street Journal this morning. So are we debating today about energy independence? We are going to pass this bill about energy independence, or is this going to be something that we are going to do after this? If so, then something about this process is dishonest. I don't know if this bill is about energy independence or, as the Speaker said, in the future we are going to talk about energy independence. I thought this bill was about energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope for the rest of this debate that the majority will clarify this, because I don't understand what this is about. And we have had a lot of strong words stated during the rules debate about dishonesty in the process, and I am thoroughly confused as to who is right. Are we doing energy independence today or are we going to do that tomorrow, as the Speaker said?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400111" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me assure the gentleman that after 12 years of Republican misrule here in the House, it will take much more than 100 hours to undo the damage. Today is a first step toward energy independence. It is certainly not the conclusion of what will be a long process that will involve all Members of this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We began this 100-hour legislative agenda with ethics laws to clean up this Congress--and it sure needed cleaning up--and we conclude it today with this effort to clean up our environment and clean up our tax code. Although modest, the CLEAN bill is truly a breath of fresh air.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our oil and gas giants are experts at drilling holes. They drill holes into our earth to get the resources that we need, but they have also been pretty fortunate in drilling holes into our tax code and comingup with tax break after billion dollar tax break.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Allowing Big Oil to convert valuable public assets to private gain also exploits public resources, but we should not also exploit the American taxpayer. Leases should be set at a fair market rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the former Republican Leadership, Big Oil's best prospecting was not in Texas, not in the Gulf of Mexico, it was right here on the floor of the House and in secret meetings with Vice President Cheney. They prospected in Washington and they never came up with a dry well. It was one gusher of tax benefits and special privileges after another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we finally have an opportunity to rewrite a genuine energy policy. We don't just end unreasonable tax breaks in this bill--tax breaks that I think even most of my Republican colleagues, will admit were unjustified--but we use the proceeds of those tax breaks to focus on renewable energy, on energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We now begin moving toward using our all-American ingenuity for what could be a job creation program of new leadership in energy technology, in clean energy. That is our objective. This CLEAN bill is an important start to restoring fiscal discipline and embarking on genuine energy independence.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my opposition to <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> and encourage my  colleagues to vote against this bill, because one of its consequences is to raise revenue for some of America's most adamant and ardent enemies, such as Mr. Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Mr. Ahmadinejad in Iran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I travel my district, my constituents have a consistent message for me: Find a way to achieve energy independence and end our reliance on foreign oil from unstable regions of the world. I am extremely disappointed that the Democrat leadership has chosen to pursue an energy bill that does nothing to achieve this goal and is simply a ruse perpetrated on the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past, I have worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to promote alternative energy legislation. In previous Congresses, I have sponsored bills to offer incentives for the development of biodiesel and ethanol, to encourage investment in coal-to-liquid technology, and increase the use of renewable fuels. Each of these received bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I attempted to offer an amendment to this bill on an issue that has received bipartisan support, but it was refused. This is the sole piece of energy legislation in the 100-hour agenda, yet our party was not allowed even a single amendment. Why has this legislation not been an opportunity to discuss real solutions to our Nation's energy crisis? Why does this bill include no provisions to move our Nation away from oil use at all?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why, Mr. Speaker? Because the majority doesn't want a real solution. They only want to stand here today and play politics with our Nation's future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I truly wish this debate could have been about the virtues of developing alternative energies. Instead, this is a veiled tax hike to create what some may say is a slush fund for future use. This is unconscionable, and I urge my colleagues to vote "no" on this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400120" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let's review the score. Big Oil, one; taxpayers, zero. But today we are about to even the score.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he took office, President Bush said this country was in need of a comprehensive energy policy. He was right, and unfortunately we are still waiting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are still waiting because rather than a solution we got a $14 billion taxpayer handout to oil and gas companies. Taxpayers were forced to pay twice, once at the pump and then again on April 15. At the same time, the five big oil companies made record profits of $97 billion in 2006, and the taxpayers were asked to subsidize their industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where are gas prices today? Almost double where they were when George Bush took office. Today, as we complete our first 100 hours, it is the beginning of clean energy and the end of dirty politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last week, my colleagues on the other side were saying that we were subsidizing; that the private sector was working in the prescription drug area, and today they argue in favor of a $14 billion taxpayer handout for big oil companies. I am proud the inconsistency doesn't seem to get in the way of a good argument.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this serves a fitting end to our first 100 hours agenda and the 6 in '06. Two weeks ago, we began the 100 hours by enacting the most comprehensive ethics reform since the Watergate era, and we end the culture of corruption where the special interests had a free rein in determining national policy. Nowhere was that corruption of the system more apparent than the handouts to the energy companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for the past 4 years, I have come to this podium and said that that gavel was supposed to open up the people's House, not the auction house. Today, I proudly can say that we have given the people a voice, stood up to the special interests, and fought for hardworking families. The score is tied, and we are just getting warmed up.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400046" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I agree completely with our Democrat friends: we need to invest more in renewable energy. It is the right thing to do, and it is long overdue. But doing it by taxing American energy companies more for exploring and creating jobs here at home makes no sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's be clear. This bill says, foreign oil and foreign jobs are good; American oil and American jobs are bad. And that is crazy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new House leadership may believe it scores in political points to target Texas energy companies and refiners, many of whom are union workers. But our communities don't think it is so funny and our union workers don't think it is so funny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill punishes energy companies for doing the research that leads to successful wells. The old Tax Code had a perverse disincentive. If you failed in finding a successful well, you could write off expenses. If you are successful, though, we punished you for it. We changed that, because we think companies ought to do more research, not less, drill accurate wells, drill fewer of them, and have smaller footprints.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision is an anti-research and an anti-environmental provision. This bill declares energy jobs in America aren't manufacturing jobs. Under this bill, we treat energy workers, including high-paying union workers, as foreign workers. We treat our people as foreign workers. And farmers are manufacturers under this bill. Cartoonists are manufacturers under this bill. But those who work on oil rigs and refineries in Texas are foreign workers, and we don't touch the foreign oil companies at  all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen, this bill will not lower gas prices one penny. It won't lessen our dependence on foreign oil one barrel. This bill does not strengthen our energy security. Just the opposite. It does not deserve our support.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412230" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time today. This bill today is a disappointment to those of us who care about the goal of energy independence. This legislation sabotages the incentives with American energy companies to expand their drilling operations and undermines the opportunities to take advantage of our Nation's untapped resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American energy reserves are very real. The Bureau of Land Management recently estimated the United States territory contains over 2 trillion barrels of oil shale, 100 billion barrels of energy just alone on the North American slopes of Alaska, enough oil to trump Saudi oil by 10-fold. And it is our U.S. policies that keep us from accessing the U.S. reserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen, when we import over 63 percent of our foreign energy supplies from foreign energy sources, who are, many times, not friendly to the United States, and spend almost $300 billion of revenue in buying those foreign energy sources, it is both a national security threat and an economic threat to this Nation. That is why it is important that we  carefully review this legislation, that we look at all the ramifications of it, and that we  work carefully together towards a process that will move us towards energy independence and also towards the exploration of renewable energy sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation that will undermine the goal of energy independence in the United States and, in doing so, also drains the resources of the average American. The solution to America's energy crisis lies in expanding our oil production capacity in the short term, while investing in the alternative energy sources in the long-term solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To subject new exploration to punitive taxes would surrender our role and our goal as an energy-independent Nation to the Middle East. And, Mr. Speaker, this logic is not an option for us at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no doubt that meeting America's energy needs is one of the most daunting challenge we face as a nation. It is not, however, an impossible challenge I believe as most Americans believe that this Congress can and must take steps towards making our Nation energy independent, so that America is not held hostage by the oil reserves of the world's most volatile regions. The path forward is clear--we must move towards energy independence by increasing domestic production of oil in he short  term while we invest in alternative sources of energy in the long term. I agree with the concept of this bill but believe this path is the wrong answer. Instead of moving towards energy independence, this bill tightens the noose around our neck by making us even more dependent on foreign oil. Never before has it been clearer that we should not and cannot depend on the Middle East for our resources, and yet that is exactly what this bill proposes we do at the expense of our own national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Slowing down the production of American oil by instating an irresponsible tax increase also represents a grave economic threat to my State. Oklahoma oil and gas producers--large and small--will be hit hard by this. Make no mistake this legislation will cost Oklahoma jobs. This tax increase will mean less money for new production and ultimately less money in State revenue. We cannot today impose a tax increase which American workers will pay tomorrow at the gas pumps.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, begins the process of weaning off of corporate welfare. This is the beginning of it, so you had better get used to it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Why isn't this welfare looked at as our tax money that we provide for these corporations?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They don't need it. You know it, and I know it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will ultimately repeal approximately $14 billion in oil subsidies given to big oil companies and, most importantly, invest those funds, because the question has been asked on the other side, will this wind up in a slush fund. They cavalierly talk about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, if you read the bill, these funds will go to clean renewable energy and energy-efficient programs. This is critical.

    <paragraph>Please pass this bill. Create a clean energy trust fund and free the resourceful minds of the most resourceful people on Earth today to do what Americans do best, to create and innovate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can kick our addiction to foreign oil, and the first step in this is to pass <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think we can appropriately dub this the Hold on to Your Wallet Congress. And today, the tax increase that is being passed is one that is being put on the energy that runs our cars and heats our homes; and tomorrow, who knows? But hold on to your wallet, America, because they are coming for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the previous speakers have said that they are trying to depict this bill as something that would be repealing subsidies to Big Oil and redirecting money to alternative energy. Both are false. Those are false premises. Even The Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Times don't agree with this bill. They know it is going to raise prices at the pump, punish domestic production, run up the cost of energy on manufactured goods, all of it being done at a time when we  are supposed to be weaning off foreign sources of oil. And this bill is going to do exactly the opposite.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is nothing in the bill that would guarantee that the increased revenues would be spent on alternative energy. While a new reserve is created, it does not have one single enforcement mechanism. In other words, the increased revenues could, in reality, be directed to any Federal discretionary expenditure without penalty, growing the government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the classic bait and switch. It is an energy tax on hardworking Americans with no guarantees for alternative energy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the CLEAN Energy Act. This plan will lead the Nation in a new direction on energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States imports 65 percent of the oil we consume. We spend $800 million every day on foreign oil-producing countries. This threatens our economic stability, our environmental security, and our national security. And today we say, enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we roll back the Republican-led Congress's giveaways to the oil industry. We stop rewarding the oil companies with taxpayer dollars; and, instead, we start to turn our attention to energy independence in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will invest the revenues, $14 billion, to put this Nation on the path to energy independence and environmental security. We will reduce our energy consumption by encouraging the development and construction of energy-efficient buildings and consumer appliances and motor vehicles; and, most importantly, we will advance our energy independence by using these revenues to research. We are going to use this money to research and develop and bring to market the alternative sources of energy for  a safer, cleaner, cheaper and American-made energy alternatives.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon this debate can sound a bit technical to people, so let me put it in very plain English. We are saving $14 billion in United States taxpayer dollars. That is an important change in values in this institution because the last Congress, when they wanted to save money, here is how they did it. They decided we will save $8 billion by going to young adults in this country and saying, you know what, we are going to change the rate of  interest on your student loan and you have got to pay more money every month. They decided at one point they will save $3 billion by saying to working class families who struggle to have health care, you have to pay more premiums now to go to the doctor. That is how they saved money in the old Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of issues at stake today, Mr. Speaker, but this is the most important one. There is now a new set of values that runs this institution. We no longer ask the least of us to sacrifice, because guess where we are getting this $14 billion from? From companies who at their best average around $15 billion a year in profit after their liabilities. That is a much more equitable way to do it. That is, in major measure, why this side of the aisle sits in the Speaker's chair today and not our opposition.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>To those that propose this bill, I want to tell you I support a large fund for renewables. I am for all renewables. But why did you choose to tax American-produced oil and gas and not tax foreign oil and gas? When you tax our production, you will have less of it, when you tax their production, you would have less foreign. You have stacked the deck. It is already cheaper to produce foreign energy than it is American energy. We have locked up so many of our fields,  and where in old tired fields the cost of producing has increased, the incentive to go in deep water because it cost so much companies wouldn't go there, and we couldn't even get there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 10 years since I have been here, we have increased foreign oil from 46 percent to 66 percent. Why is foreign energy taking over? Ninety percent of the land in this country available for oil production is government land, and this Congress has been locking so much of it up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I totally agree with a large renewable energy fund, but instead of increasing the cost of producing energy in America, open up new fields. The Outer Continental Shelf is our greatest untouched area. We are the only civilized country in the world that doesn't produce there. Everybody produces there. It makes no sense for us not to be there. We haven't even allowed seismic testing to find out what is there because we might produce it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Locking up supply by this Congress in the past, by Congress and by those proposing this bill, is why four of the oil companies are making huge profits. When energy usage is increasing more than renewables can increase, you need more oil and gas. And when you need more oil and gas and you lock it up, you give those who have purchased the rights to it all over the world, their $30 oil becomes $60 oil becomes $70 oil, that is where their huge profits are. It is the Congress of the United States  that has rewarded Big Oil with increased profits.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it was just about a year ago that the President of the United States came before this Congress and told the country that America is addicted to oil. He was right then and many of us were pleased to hear him acknowledge that very real fact. However, even as we all acknowledge the seriousness of the energy challenge we face as a Nation, the President and the last Congress failed to actually do something about it. We heard great words, but didn't see good deeds. In fact, rather than  invest adequately in renewable energy and energy efficiency, we took the opposite approach. We gave greater breaks in taxes to the oil and gas industry even as prices at the pump went up and profits soared. That policy only served to feed the addiction to oil, not break that addiction. It made us more dependent, not less dependent on oil and gas and the volatile regions of the world that control the greatest reserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a time to change direction, to set a new course on energy policy, to say to the country: We're not just talking rhetoric. We mean what we say.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I have been listening to this debate. It is, like all debates, interesting. Yesterday we had a debate, a relatively extended debate, in which Republican after Republican rose and said, This bill does not do enough. In this instance, it does not bring us full energy independence. That is obvious. But person after person got up and said, We're not doing enough for students, we're not doing enough for college aid, and then, lo and behold, the vote was taken and 356 people out of 435 voted for that  bill, including 124 Republicans. We are not doing enough in this bill, that is clear, but the journey of a thousand miles, as has been observed, starts with a step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another individual got up, and then I will go to my remarks, and talked about the Washington Post editorial. An interesting comment that she made. I don't think she had perhaps read all of the editorial because the editorial said this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The good part of the bill revokes tax breaks for oil and gas production in the United States that should never have been granted."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe in the free market system. What is the free market system? If you have a demand for a product and you can get a good price for it, you produce it. That's supply and demand. In point of fact, the price of the product has gone up and up and up. I do not criticize the oil companies for wanting a tax break. We all want tax breaks. What I criticize is the Congress of the United States for not making a judgment on behalf of the American people. That is who I criticize. The actions taken in  the ETI bill were wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, one of the lessons that most of us learn early on is to study history so that we can avoid making the same mistakes of the past. A generation ago, this Nation faced a series of crises born of an overreliance on foreign oil. Prices spiked and supplies were rationed. It took work, but Congress and the President acted to combat that dependence and ushered in a wave of new technologies, conservation and efficiency improvements that have saved untold billions of dollars and barrels of  oil and greatly enhanced the Nation's economic performance and national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, in recent years, however, we seem to have forgotten that time period. The economy grew, the price of oil waned and we forgot the lessons of the past and abandoned the progress toward a more fuel efficient existence. Mr. Speaker, crises at home and abroad have changed that, changed it dramatically, and we find ourselves once again increasingly reliant on foreign oil. And drilling for more oil and gas alone is not the solution. Mr. Bartlett said that earlier today. Oil is  a wasting resource. What wasting means is it is going to go away. I have a great-grandchild, unlike some of you who are much younger than I am. She may not use oil. It may not be available for her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we will pass the last of the bills that we promised the American people we would undertake at the beginning of this Congress. This legislation is but a first down payment on the promise of a new energy future for our country. This bill is not about punishing one sector of industry, nor does this bill represent the totality or even a substantial component of our energy policy, as evidenced by the Rural Caucus's biofuels energy package, Speaker Pelosi's innovation agenda, and the  PROGRESS Act, which I, along with 129-plus Members of this body in the last Congress, introduced. However, the CLEAN Act starts to move our Nation in a new direction. It is about the focus of precious taxpayer dollars and the future of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The oil and gas industry is extraordinarily well-established and well-off. I applaud it for being so. It does not need the American taxpayers' help to be successful or to make a dollar. There is not an American who goes to the gas pump that doesn't know that. Even President Bush, a former executive of an oil company, agrees that the industry does not need additional government subsidies when prices are this high. But our future energy resources do need help to get started. Renewable energy, alternative  fuels, conservation and efficiency programs are underutilized in our effort to wean our Nation off our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The money saved by this bill will be spent on our energy future and set aside to, among other things, accelerate the use of clean domestic renewable energy resources and alternative fuels; promote the use of energy efficiency practices and conservation; and increase research, development and deployment of clean renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By acting now to take this small but significant step to move toward making America energy independent, we have the opportunity, ladies and gentlemen of this House, to leave future generations a lasting legacy that makes our Nation and our world a better place. The legislation is a good first start in that effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400123" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in response may I yield myself 15 seconds, simply to point out to the majority leader that he is terribly mistaken if he thinks he is repealing a special tax break. In fact, oil and other energy production was treated the same way under the tax bill that was passed as all other manufacturers, and this differential treatment is one of the reasons why the National Association of Manufacturers so strongly opposes this bill. This does not fulfill any of their  commitments on energy any more than the underlying rule fulfills their commitment to an open process.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my constituents, like yours, paid over $3 a gallon for gas last year. Isn't that enough? Do they really need to be paying a second time with their tax dollars?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, Big Oil saw higher profits than any industry in the history of the world, yet we are writing them welfare checks. The United States is 65 percent dependent on foreign oil, worse than we have ever been before, sending $800 million a day to the Middle East. This situation creates conflicts of interest in crucial matters of security and diplomacy whereby we, the United States of America, are beholden to nations who do not represent our best interests. Still, we are cutting a welfare check  to Big Oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we embrace the wave of the future and dedicate ourselves to developing alternative, renewable, clean more-affordable energy sources, America will create more than a quarter million new jobs, generate $30 billion in new worker wages, and finally stop funding both sides of the war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite all that, we are still using taxpayer dollars to hand a huge welfare check to billionaire oil companies. The CLEAN Energy Act takes the crucial first steps to ending this policy, and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I had prepared remarks, but I am going to set them aside and submit them for the RECORD, because as I was listening to the debate, I couldn't believe my ears as speaker after speaker on the other side of the aisle came up and attacked this relatively simple piece of legislation, talking about how it doesn't go far enough and it doesn't do this and it doesn't do that, when they have had at least 6 years to actually do something about the energy crisis in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When they had the opportunity to do something, they came up with that god-awful 2005 energy bill, where 93 percent of the tax subsidies went to oil, gas and nuclear, and only 7 percent went to alternative energy sources, so that we could develop these alternative energy sources, harness the Sun, wind, Moon, not the Moon, although maybe if we had enough money, we could try that too, geothermal, all of these possible alternative energy sources. And what did they do? Seven measly percent of the  tax subsidies went to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would suggest that we have a golden opportunity to do something, and I  urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. It is a good first step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in 2005, Congress passed energy legislation intended to promote secure, affordable and reliable energy. This was an important goal, because many of us realized that to keep our Nation safe, we must break our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, instead of focusing on the promotion of clean, renewable energy sources, the 2005 energy bill gave substantial subsidies to the oil and gas industry. I voted against this bill because it made no sense to give incentives to an industry that was enjoying record profits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, oil and gas companies continue to rake in high profits while Congress fails to offer substantial incentives to alternative energy investors. In the absence of effective federal policy to promote investment in renewables, many states have passed their own incentives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home state of Nevada, the legislature has required that by 2015, 20 percent of power sold to Nevadans come from renewables. Nevadans are already seeing results from this mandate--last June, construction began in Las Vegas on the largest solar power installation in the country built by a public agency, and five other solar projects are planned for southern Nevada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am supporting <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> today because it is a great first step toward securing energy independence. In the last Congress, I introduced a bill to promote renewable energy production, and I reintroduce this bill in the 110th Congress. We are far from being energy independent, but today's bill is a good place to start, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we know, the House is considering a part of the 100-hours agenda, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the Creating Long-Term Energy Alternatives for the Nation Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation seeks to end the unwarranted tax breaks and subsidies which have been lavished on Big Oil over the last several years, and done so at a time of record prices at the gas pump and record oil industry profits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Big Oil is hitting the American taxpayer not once, not twice, but three times. They are hitting them at the pump, they are hitting them at the Treasury through the Tax Code, and they are hitting them with royalty holidays put into oil in 1995 and again in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, our people back home stand in their work boots pumping precious, costly gas into their tanks, while energy lobbyists have scuttled about in Armani suits wanting more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, over the last few years we have suffered an unprecedented assault on America's resources and on American taxpayer pockets under the guise of contributing to our energy security. It almost seems like Albert Fall's ghost walks the halls of the Interior Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as you remember, Fall was the Secretary of the Interior who embroiled the administration of Warren Harding in the infamous Teapot Dome scandal. Without competitive bidding, Fall leased the Federal oil reserves at Teapot Dome and the Naval oil reserves at Elk Hills in exchange for $404,000 in gifts from the oilmen. In those days, that was a hefty sum of money, but a princely sum back in 1992.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we have a situation at the Interior Department where the OCS oil and gas leasing program is hemorrhaging money as a result of unwarranted royalty relief, royalty underpayments, inadequate audits and potential fraud. The GAO and the Interior Department's Inspector General, Earl Devaney, in particular, have issued scathing reports on these matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, in testimony before the House Government Reform Committee hearing on the bureaucratic bungling of oil and gas leases, Devaney went so far as to say: "Simply stated, short of a crime, anything goes at the highest level of the Department of the Interior."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is no small matter. These are public resources. The names of every American are on the deeds to these public lands and waters where these drillings for oil and natural gas take place. Royalties from this production contribute a significant amount to the Treasury, nearly $8 billion in the last fiscal year, and it would be more if it were not for all the mismanagement at the Department of the Interior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The pending legislation represents the beginning of the exorcism of Albert's Fall's ghost from the Interior Department by dealing with one egregious aspect of the OCS leasing program. I can assure my colleagues that the Natural Resources Committee will follow up with aggressive hearings into other areas of this program in the near future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The situation that we seek to address in the pending bill, of course, harkens back to the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995, which Congress passed over the objections of many on this side of the aisle. That act sought to encourage oil companies to drill in the Gulf of Mexico by allowing them to avoid paying royalties on oil and gas production of publicly owned resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of us warned at the time, this was nothing but an unwarranted giveaway of public resources, paying the companies to do what they would do anyway, drill for oil. To make matters worse, the Interior Department botched the administration of the law. They failed to include provisions in leases issued between 1998 and 1999 to cut off royalty relief when market prices are high. In other words, these leases did not contain any threshold, any threshold, for when royalty relief would kick in.  According to GAO, the failure to include price cutoffs for royalty relief in the 1998-99 gulf leases could cost the Treasury up to $10 billion. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> would fix these abuses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would establish thresholds in the 1998-1999 leases for royalty relief. The holders of these royalty-free leases would be required to either agree to negotiate with the Interior Department to pay royalties when market prices reach those thresholds, or pay a new conservation resource fee established in the bill. In addition, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> would impose an annual per-acre fee on nonproducing OCS oil and gas leases. According to CBO, these provisions would raise $6.3 billion over 10 years, money  that could be used to finance renewable and alternative energy initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are two items that I would like to emphasize with respect to these provisions. First, this legislation is not violating any contractual arrangements. The leases in question were issued with a clause that allows the Federal Government to impose new requirements on them in the future, such  as the conservation resource fee being proposed in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the House is already on record as supporting provisions of this nature. Provisions of this legislation as they relate to the OCS leases have been addressed by amendments offered in the past by MAURICE HINCHEY, ED MARKEY, RON KIND, and RA&amp;#218;L GRIJALVA over the years. Further, the Jindal-Pombo OCS leasing bill that passed the House last year also included the imposition of a fee on the 1998 and 1999 royalty-free leases. So I would point out that none of the oil companies  complained about their contracts being violated at that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> would repeal the extension of the original 1995 royalty relief provision that was contained in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and also reform several other royalty relief and special benefit provisions in that law. Amendments offered in the past by RON KIND and RA&amp;#218;L GRIJALVA over the last two Congresses to various of our energy legislation attempted to strike these provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So now, as I conclude, Mr. Speaker, it is time to stand up and be counted: to vote for the integrity of America's resources, to vote for the end of corporate welfare, to vote for a new dawn, a new era, in the management of our public energy resources. And that is to vote for <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would say to my dear colleagues, just about 100 hours ago you stood in this House and raised your hand and you followed this quote with an "I do": "Do you solemnly swear you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, and I am wearing this red shirt today, is the color of the bill that we are debating, communist red. It is a taking. And regardless of what one says, it will go to court, and it should be decided in court. It should be decided there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My biggest concern, it is often said the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and this is a great example. The good intentions of this bill are a pursuit of new forms of energy to replace our dependency. We all support that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But even The Washington Post, which is not my favorite newspaper, says this is a low-wattage bill and it fits the realm of Russia and Putin, and it fits Bolivia and Venezuela. And if there is anything this bill will do, in fact it will increase the competitive edge of foreign oil imported to this country. That is what this bill does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues, if the problem is foreign oil, and it is, why increase taxes and make it harder to produce American oil and gas? That makes no sense to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had a motion to recommit and I cannot offer it, but I wanted to take and strike everything after the enacting clause and insert taxes on all foreign oil imported. That would raise your money for renewable resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what we are doing here today is taxing our domestic oil. We are raising dollars supposedly for renewable resources, yet we are still burning fossil fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is really a San Francisco energy policy, and America is not San Francisco.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My State gets 85 percent of its budget from oil production. I am proud of it and I hope we get more. The pipeline we want to build for gas to deliver the oil to the lower 48 will cost $20 billion, and this, by increasing taxes and taking away the incentives, which this bill does, raises the question of whether we can finance this pipeline, which we all need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We talk about Joe Blow and all the rest of these people in the smaller income brackets and get the big old oil companies. The reality is if this bill was to become law gas would go to $5 a gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everybody talks about Big Oil and how much profit they made. These international companies are making that profit overseas shipping the oil to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you want to do this right, then let us tax the foreign oil. Let us not tax the American oil. Let us not hurt our little companies, which this bill does. Let us not discourage what I call the frontier areas. Let us help American oil to deliver oil to the American people and quit paying the money to the foreign oil companies, and that is what you are doing.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in 2005, during the debate on the energy bill, I asked my colleagues to strike down provisions that amounted to more corporate welfare for oil companies. At that time the Republican majority voted down that amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as news reports continue to mount regarding the billions of dollars in profit oil and gas companies are reaping we have to look seriously at that policy. Why should the American taxpayer continue to shell out subsidies to oil companies when clearly they need no incentives to drill?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, why are we still allowing them to drill in our public lands and waters for free because of some mistakes made in the 1990s during the leasing process?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Had the President and his appointees acted when this was discovered, it would have saved taxpayers upwards of $1 billion that has already been lost. Instead, they have deliberately ignored and covered up this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must send a message that the American taxpayer will no longer be ripped off by Big Oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But ending this fiscally ridiculous practice of subsidies for megarich oil companies is not enough. We also need to make a clean break from the past and take a bold step into the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Global warming is upon us. We need clean renewable fuel, and we need it now. It will be a tough transition but we have to start right now. We are ready for this challenge. We have the know-how and a highly skilled workforce, and we will create millions of new jobs in the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the strongest way possible, I urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, a hometown American energy bill that helps and protects the American taxpayer.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Sullivan).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400392" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, legislation that puts America's independent energy producers at risk and increases America's dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill unfairly punishes offshore oil and natural gas companies who signed leases with the Federal Government in 1998 and 1999. These leases, due to a mistake by the Clinton administration, did not set price thresholds for royalty incentives. The bill requires all companies to renegotiate these leases, even though they were fairly signed in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The companies who entered into these agreements cannot be blamed for the Federal Government's mistakes. The contracts signed by the Federal Government and energy producers are legal and binding, regardless of the mistakes of the Federal Government in drafting them. In addition, a fair version of this provision was included in the Republican Outer Continental Shelf drilling bill that was adopted last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We talk about this and I think this is a national security issue. Right now we  should be encouraging domestic production here in the United States of America, and we are not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We get 60 percent of our oil from foreign sources, and a lot of that oil that we are getting is from areas that we are at conflict with or we have carpet bombed recently. I think it is asinine we are not doing all we can to spur domestic production here in the United States and not penalizing companies for doing such. It is absolutely ridiculous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only are gas prices low right now, in Tulsa where I am from it is below $2 a gallon when I left this past week, but also crude oil prices are as low as they were in 2005. They are going down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All this legislation will do is increase gasoline prices at the pump to upwards of $5 a barrel. What we need to be working on is a comprehensive energy policy in this country that will actually get prices down by not only spurring domestic production but also working on getting more refining capacity in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are operating at 100 percent capacity right now. We need to be expanding, building five or so additional refineries in this country. And we can do it in an environmentally sound way.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, well, who would have ever thought that the Republicans would be defending welfare queens on the floor of the House of Representatives, but they are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lee Raymond, just-retired CEO, ExxonMobil, $400 million, part of it in tax subsidies, part of it in royalty forgiveness, and part of it gouging consumers at the pump. But they are standing up here today to defend poor little ole Lee Raymond with his $400 million pension and ExxonMobil, his company, that only made $29.2 billion last year, the largest corporate profit in the history of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They need those subsidies or they will not go out and explore for oil, the Republicans will tell us. Here they are defending welfare queens, subsidies to the most profitable industry in the world. It is sad to see the Republicans come to this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, they laughably say this will lead to higher prices. Oh, higher prices, unlike the price gouging after Katrina where gasoline went over three bucks a gallon in Oregon and we do not even get any supply from the eastern United States? Or the price gouging that goes on day in, day out? The price fixing that goes on day in, day out in this industry? The collusion between the American companies, the foreign companies operating in America, and the OPEC cartel to drive down the supply, to drive  up the price, which gives them an excuse to go even higher at the pump?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What about a trade complaint to the WTO? No, the Republican administration does not support that, but George Bush does support two provisions of this bill, saying those are tax breaks that are not necessary to the oil industry. The oil man in the White House says the oil industry does not need this, and the Republicans are down here fighting hard to preserve it, to drain money from the taxpayer, to not take royalties. Unlike any other owner of public resources, the United States would be the  only one not to take royalty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, they talked about communism. That would be communism if we did not get a fair return for our taxpayers, if we did not get a fair return for depleting our resources.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400313" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring a couple of points up on this in response to the gentleman who was just making the points.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, we talk about the $440 million that the head of Exxon makes. If we divide out the numbers of millions and billions of dollars that Exxon pays out to shareholders and compare it to Tiger Woods, for instance, Tiger Woods made $25,181 a stroke. Shaquille O'Neal made $18,300 per minute that he played. A-Rod made $180,000 per run batted in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the people who provide gasoline and oil at the price, $3 for gasoline, you will pay more than $3 for this fingernail polish that comes out to $25,000 per bottle. This bottled water is over $400 per barrel, and it does not require an investment in an operation like this. These offshore platforms are over $1 billion investment, and you are saying that oil is overpriced and we are gouging the American consumers. Next, you should go after bottled water and after fingernail polish because this  is $25,000 per barrel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to understand that it takes a lot of investment to put gas in the pumps. It cannot be done. I have heard today that we are going to provide wave energy. Wave energy on our F-16s, I can just imagine it now. The investments to power this Nation are extraordinarily high, and we are not overcompensating the companies that do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green), a gentleman with whom we have worked with on this legislation in good faith and appreciate his leadership and input.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400160" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of our Natural Resources Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, most Americans believe that dependence on foreign oil is a problem and alternative energy sources deserve our support, particularly after 9/11. The recent election season saw such high consumer gas prices and high anxiety about energy security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let us look at another industry. Very cold weather in southern California is causing loss of fruits and vegetables, and ranchers in the Midwest are losing cattle because of the cold weather. The farmers and ranchers who still have crops and livestock stand to make a lot of money from the price spikes that we are seeing literally as we stand here on the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Are we blaming those farmers and ranchers for the high prices? Are we going to cut farm benefits and raise taxes on the farmers? No.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But for some reason when we have cold winters and hot summers and hurricanes in the gulf that raise gas prices, we all get mad at energy suppliers. It is the easy way out to get mad at the industry, since most of our country just uses energy and does not produce it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a budget deficit, and funds for new alternative energy programs are in short supply. So industry is being targeted for this purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand why my colleagues are choosing to do this, but this plan carries a significant risk of being counterproductive, especially in the near future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> exempts the oil and gas industry from a recent manufacturing tax benefit, cuts geological expense to major energy producers and requires new payments on 1998-1999 offshore leases to make up for serious government errors in the original contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These provisions raise $14 billion over 10 years for clean alternative energy programs that Congress will establish through regular order. That is why I support this bill. That $14 billion will be used for alternatives through the regular order of this Congress, through our committee process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These tax provisions reduce incentives for domestic production and could increase dependence on foreign oil and LNG which hurt national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With current high oil prices, we may not miss these incentives as much if prices were low, but the effects could be very real in the long term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the 100 hours energy bill is a compromise within the Democratic Caucus to promote alternative energy. For the first time in my years in Congress, the Democratic leadership included the Members from energy producing States in the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The section 199 tax provision is most unfair because it singles out oil and gas as ineligible, as compared to other manufacturing operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The main royalty provision is based on the Jindal-Pombo bill that House Republicans overwhelmingly supported a few months ago in June.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also very concerned about the effects of the provision on contract certainty in U.S. oil and gas leasing, but for better or worse, there is a consensus among both parties to address this 1998-1999 lease issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this bill is a far cry from my preferred energy policies, the Democratic leadership has been narrow and targeted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After extensive discussions between our office and other Members' offices  from oil and gas producing States, this bill does not include more punitive measures that seek to alter long-standing oil and gas tax or accounting treatment that could destabilize our Nation's gasoline supply even more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do not repeal the refinery tax provision or the deductions for intangible drilling costs. We also do not eliminate LIFO accounting, impose a windfall profits tax, or repeal of natural gas distribution line depreciation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a result and the good faith we have had in this 100 hours agenda, I am voting for the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I close, I have two messages. First, you cannot hit an industry for $14 billion and go back time and time again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And my second message is to the oil and gas industry. With the recent November elections, this bill should be a wake-up call to explain energy issues to Democratic Members who may have been ignored in recent years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also do not eliminate LIFO accounting, impose a windfall profits tax, or repeal of natural gas distribution line depreciation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, and as a show of good faith during this critical 100 hours period for our new majority, I am voting for this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I close I have two messages, and the first is for the Democratic Caucus--when you hit one industry for $14 billion, you cannot go back for more later and expect enough gasoline in your cars and fuel to heat and cool our homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My second message for the oil and gas industry--the recent November election and this bill should be a wake-up call to explain energy issues to Democratic members that they may have ignored in recent years. We are going to need those members to prevent additional legislation of this type.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is evident in the Democrats' energy bill, to gain and achieve energy independence they are not using any coal in this country. And I hope that the majority party from the Resources Committee can answer at some point during this debate why clean coal and coal-to-liquid technology is not included as a possibility to achieve energy independence.

  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time. The gentleman is inaccurate. The fund created would allow for the development of renewable and alternative fuels. And as far as the lack of clean coal technology in the past, it is because Congress in the past energy bills has never gotten serious about clean coal technology. Lip service, yes. Authorizations to go fish, yes. But hard-core appropriation dollars for clean coal technology, no. Thanks to my senior colleague in the other body, yes, we did  that, but not through any actions of energy policy acts of this Congress in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, besides, how can we get anything from coal when we are so addicted to the oil diet? Because we give tax incentives and royalty holidays and other grants to the oil industry without any mention of coal in these pieces of legislation.</paragraph>

And we did bring to the Rules Committee an amendment that would amend the language in this bill to allow some of this money to go to contract with the Department of Defense so they can move on coal-to-liquid provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know there are really three avenues to expand coal-to-liquid technology: one is forward contracting for the Department of Defense; one is a tax provision; and the other one is a collar provision that we are working on. And if we could have gotten some provision in this bill, because there is going to be money available to move directly, we have got to get that first coal-to-liquid plant built, then the others will come. And I think that is what our disappointment is.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I understand the point that the gentleman from California raises, and it is not one with which I disagree. If I might say, in due process, in due time that will be considered by this Congress. I have no question about it. This bill is not a comprehensive energy bill. Nobody is out here touting it as such. That is to be addressed later. This is part of our 6 for '06 agenda; it is to get us started in the right direction, and my agenda on the Natural Resources Committee will go much  further than this, not only hearings on our bills and legislation, but extensive oversight over the entire oil and gas leasing program both offshore and onshore.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we really do begin America's clean revolution in this bill. Every revolution has a beginning. The American Revolution began at Concord; the aerospace revolution began at Kittyhawk; and America's clean energy revolution begins today with this bill. And years from now when we have licked global warming and we have achieved energy independence, we will look back to this day as the first step on the road to clean energy for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we are going to break the shackles of oil and gas. We are going to free Americans to invent, to innovate, to create the clean technologies we need in energy. This is only common sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We pay once at the pump for gasoline already. We shouldn't have to pay again on tax day on April 15 to line the pockets of the oil and gas industry. It is common sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our national resources should be going to the innovators who will lead us in energy in the 21st century, rather than to those who have kept us in serfdom to the oil industry, an industry of the 19th century. Change is afoot starting today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we are going to unleash the talents of the Nanosolar Company in California. It is perfecting thin cell solar cells. We are going to empower the Ocean Power Technology Company that is perfecting wave energy, enough wave energy off the California coast to light the entire State. We will get loan guarantees to the Iogen Corporation, which is going to build the first cellulosic ethanol plant in the Western World in Idaho starting today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we recognize that the solution to our energy challenges is not below our feet in the ground. It is above our shoulders in our brains, and we are going to unleash the intellectual talents of America to see that that happens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be introducing again the New Apollo Energy Project bill, which will marshal our Nation's talents, just as John Kennedy marshaled our national resources in the original Apollo Project. Today is the first step of the new Apollo Energy Project. Tomorrow I will introduce the Plug-In Hybrid Bill, a bill that will hasten the day when our cars are powered on clean energy, clean electricity, and clean biofuels so we can get our energy from Midwestern farmers rather than Middle Eastern sheiks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are just two of the many steps on this long road of the clean energy revolution; and there is no silver bullet to our energy challenges, but there is a silver lining, and that is the genius of the American people. Today we are freeing the genius of the American people. It is long overdue.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400373" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, again, I enjoyed my comments with my colleague, but I know my colleague from Washington State who just left would not mention coal. My folks from the west coast will not mention the benefits of coal, and we have a lot of work to do. We are going to continue to move it forward, and this was our opportunity to be helpful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to talk about section 199. And I know my colleagues on the other side like to talk about the Big Oil guys, but let's talk about the Little Oil guys, the ones in southern Illinois. In southern Illinois, we produce about 30,000 barrels of crude oil per day amounting to $574 million minus about one-eighth of that to royalty owners. These are small mom and pop operations of marginal wells, you know, those wells that you have to put energy in to get the crude oil out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 199 has three primary purposes: exploration, that is a good thing. Production, that is a good thing. Refining, that is a good thing. Three good things to help address our reliance on imported crude oil from overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Illinois crude oil, being delivered from Illinois soil up to the surface area so that it can meet our fuel needs, the attack on section 199 in this bill to a small mom and pop oil producer in southern Illinois in 2008 will be a $200,000 tax increase. In 2009, it will be a $300,000 tax increase on this small marginal oil producer. This is money that she, a woman-owned business operation, cannot use to expand, employ, provide health care benefits to. This is all money that is going to come out  of the bottom line in her ability to expand and find new oil reserves and resources in southern Illinois, and that is why I am going to vote against this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if you want to decrease our reliance on foreign energy--exploiting our coal reserves is one way. I offered and amendment through the rules committee that would move some of the revenue from this tax increase to allow DOD to forward contract and purchase CTL fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this bill will make it more difficult to recover what oil we have left in Southern Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Southern Illinois--we produce around 30,000 barrels of crude per day amounting to $574 million minus about  1/8  of that to royalty owners. These are all small mom and pop operations and marginal wells.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The smaller oil and gas producers in my district rely on Section 199 deduction as it lowers the effective tax rate on manufacturing income that comes from exploration, production and refining.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One small producer in my district, for example, estimates that depending on the timing the Democratic repeal would go into effect, they would lose $200,000 in 2008 and around $300,000 in 2009. Now this is $500,000 that a small oil and gas producer in rural Southern Illinois cannot use to improve the efficiency of their business, buy new equipment, hire new employees or even use to pay health insurance cost of their current employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regular order would have allowed a committee to hear some of these concerns so that adjustments could have been made to eliminate the unintended consequences of this bill--or maybe they aren't unintended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amortization of Geological and Geophysical (G&amp;G) expenses, another provision that they are trying to repeal today--was passed in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, because it allows producers to affordably use a technology to examine, without drilling, the best spot to drill for oil or gas--this is also an environmentally friendly practice--without it they would have to revert to drilling all over an area to find an optimal drilling point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cost of this Geophysical exploration is around 20 to 30 thousand dollars per square mile of exploration--so simple math shows you that this is a significant investment that is being made by the industry, taking that away will lower production and efficiency, making the U.S. less competitive in the world market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to develop policies that make it easier to produce affordable domestic energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, again, we did that in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that is why expansion is starting to happen today. Expansion with petroleum refineries, with ethanol refineries, with clean coal generation, nuclear generation, expansion of the areas where we can explore for new energy sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here are some numbers: Over 500 million of new ethanol production and nearly 30 new plants; 500 million gallons of new annual ethanol production online; 25 new nuclear reactors planned; 2,000 megawatts of new wind power online; 120 new coal-based facilities in various stages of planning; and 2 million barrels of oil daily that can be replaced by clean, synthetic fuel from coal by 2025.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Raising taxes in this bill will in fact do more harm to the little guys--the guys that are spread across the U.S. diversifying where our domestic petroleum and gas come from. And will not help us reduce our dependence on foreign sources of gas and oil.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this week I received an e-mail message from a constituent of mine in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. She said: "Please help turn the tide by doing not a little but a lot to help solar, wind, hydrogen become the mainstream energy sources and turn oil into the alternative."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She is right. This legislation which will end the subsidies, renegotiate the leases, and use the revenues to develop sustainable energy technologies is a very good start.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are any number of things. Take wind energy. The United States does not lead the world in total production of wind energy. We fall behind Spain, Germany, Denmark. It is because these governments have made commitments that we have not. We have lost some technological leads that we have had, and we won't lessen our addiction to foreign oil in the United States without making investment in these sustainable energy sources. Wind is just one example. Generating power from the oceans is another.  This bill is not enough, but it is a good start.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the Creating Long-term Energy Alternatives for the Nation Act or the CLEAN Energy Act. This is an important step for our nation in reducing our dependence on foreign oil and I commend Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Rahall, and Chairman Rangel for including this legislation in the first 100 hours of legislative business in the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have already heard from our colleagues today about the three major tenets of this bill--ending subsidies for large oil companies, renegotiating leases for oil companies that have avoided paying royalties on leases they signed in 1998 and 1999, and creating the Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve. I would like to take some time to speak about the importance of the Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new sustainable energy reserve created in this legislation will be funded by repealing the tax breaks that have been provided to the large oil companies, who consistently reap excessive profits at the expense of the American consumer. There is a lot that is funding can be used for. It is my hope that we focus our attention on research and development of sustainable energy sources and invest in the technologies needed to wean ourselves from fossil fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One example of a real investment is the wind industry. It was once the case that the wind industry was based-only in California. Production across the country has increased, and I commend the industry for the progress they have made. There is, of course, still more we can do. The United States does not lead the world in total production of wind energy--we fall behind Spain and Germany. These countries have a greater commitment to wind energy than we. And Denmark has made a turnaround in the past  thirty years, moving away from relying solely on oil to relying a great deal on wind power for their electricity. This is because the government in Denmark made a real commitment to investing in this technology. The United States can and should be the leader on wind energy. With the proper investment from the government, it will be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the American Wind Energy Association, 46 of our states have the potential to produce significant wind energy. We must harness this potential across our country and make a real commitment to wind power. We can start by including a long term extension of the production tax credit. We can also adopt a renewable portfolio standard, which over twenty states have already done on their own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will not lessen our addiction on foreign oil in the United States without making the investment in alternative energy sources now. Wind energy is not the only solution to our energy needs. Neither is generating power from the ocean. But investing in research and development in a variety of different sustainable energy sources will lead us on our path to energy independence. But having a dedicated renewable energy reserve to fund this research and development is an important step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of my constituents have written to me over the past few years passionately urging us in Congress to reverse our energy policy. Just last Friday, I received an email from a constituent of mine in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. She said "Please help turn the tide by doing not a little, but a lot, to help solar, wind, and hydrogen [power] become the mainstream energy source[s]--and turn oil into the "alternative"." She is right. We must do something drastic to change our energy policy and put  our country back on a rational energy path. Making advancements in sustainable energy sources is a major component of where our energy policy should be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, this bill is not enough. But it is a start, and a very good start. Once we pass this bill, we will be able to consider other alternative energy legislation and I am confident that we will. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400317" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask again: Why did we start the new energy independence with taxing domestic production but not taxing foreign oil? We are going to lead us in the wrong direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In your anger against Big Oil, I understand that, but you are penalizing everybody. Eighty-two percent of natural gas is produced by independents; 68 percent of oil is produced by independents; 50 percent of refined products is from independents. My little refinery in Warren, Pennsylvania, will get taxed harder because of your new bill. And I have watched them struggle to fund clean diesel; I watched them struggle to fund clean gasoline units, very expensive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The use of foreign oil under your bill will continue at the same rate of increase, and I predict in 5 years will be 76 percent dependent. I am for all your renewables, I want to fund them all. But if we produce the energy, took the royalties from the new energy that keeps us alive in this country, we could fund them adequately. If we don't open new fields, we will not have a fertilizer industry, a petrochemical industry, a polymers and plastics industry, and we will make bricks and glass in South  America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to make three quick points. Sadly, this bill will increase our dependency on foreign oil, exactly the wrong public policy. It taxes the production of domestic oil and, therefore, encourages us to buy more foreign oil. The wrong policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, this bill will increase the cost of gasoline and fuel oil for every American. Make no mistake about it, when you increase the tax, the producers will pass that tax on and our prices are going up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I want to make a broader, more important point, and that is to discuss for the American people and for the record how this bill and the preceding five bills were brought to the floor. That procedure is a raw exercise of power, and I would like to ask my Democratic colleagues why they are afraid to allow discussion and dissent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill came to the floor allowing Republicans no amendments. Zero. This bill didn't go through committee. It couldn't be amended in committee and it can't be amended on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some people say this is a response to the Contract With America. I would like to make the point that in the Contract With America, we were allowed to set our agenda. You are entitled to set your agenda here. But in the Contract With America, for those bills we allowed Democrats to offer 154 floor amendments. To our Contract With America in 1995, you got to offer 154 amendments. We get to offer zero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In our Contract With America, in allowing you to offer 154 amendments in addition to the amendments in committee, 48 of the Democrat amendments to the Republican Contract With America were adopted and became a part of the bill. Zero Republican amendments will be adopted because you allow none.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not understand and I do not believe that beginning this debate by not allowing the minority to express itself shows any pride. Let the minority speak. What are you afraid of?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thought we had all learned in the aftermath of the Kelo decision that the American people are offended when the government grabs property without just compensation. Yet this bill does exactly that. This bill forces owners of certain oil and gas leases to renegotiate those leases and forces them to forgo all economic benefits from those leases until they do so. This is a clear violation of the fifth amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The word "integrity" in this bill has been used several times today. It is offensive in the extreme just because of what my colleague just mentioned. The lead-in sentence to section 202, which is the beginning of this wreck where we take money, confiscate money from otherwise good hardworking individuals for government purposes, says, "The Secretary of Interior shall agree to a request by any lessee," and I can assure you that no lessee that has negotiated in good faith leases is going to  request without some sort of a gun held to their head, and that gun is this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tax rates go up and tax rates go down. Everybody understands that. Every businessman understands that. What these businessmen don't understand is this Congress's attack on the sanctity of contracts. These leases were signed in 1998 and 1999. If mistakes were made by the Federal Government, fine, go find those lawyers and bring them up on malpractice suits. But those leases were signed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has delay rentals which were not in the original negotiation. This bill takes money away from those folks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line for this increase in taxes and these takings is that there will be less money reinvested in oil and gas domestic production. Every reduction in domestic production leads to a demand for foreign crude oil and foreign natural gas. I recommend a "no" vote on this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard complaints from across the aisle today alleging that oil and gas leases being addressed right now were negotiated in a culture of corruption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if the Democrats have evidence that the Clinton administration that negotiated these leases did so  corruptly, it needs to be brought forward. If that evidence is there, the Attorney General can go forward and rescind these leases and get damages. Maybe that is some of the evidence that Sandy Berger was stuffing in his socks to steal away. But if we don't have the evidence, then it is not right to go forward and break contractual words of  this country and this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once upon a time there was a king who broke his word regularly, like the Democrats are trying to do here, and our forefathers came forth with a document that said when in the course of human events it becomes necessary to dissolve the political bands which have connected one with another, that is what started this country when the king started being so arbitrary and capricious as this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now our forefathers tried to protect against that, so they inserted in the Bill of Rights a fifth amendment provision called the takings clause that says you shall not take private property for public use without just compensation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now this bill basically says if you don't renegotiate your lease, you can't get any more leases on your existing lease. You can't have economic benefit. That is one of the things. The Penn Central case from 1978 made clear what the test was, and this rises to the level of a regulatory taking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this bill, the Democrats are also going to try to change the Tax Code and deprive the oil and gas industry of a deduction that every other industry has. And what it will do is, in effect, prevent domestic drilling, drive us to more foreign oil and send money to our enemies. We should rename the bill the "Chavez Shelter Bill" or the "Terrorist Assistance Bill" or maybe the "National Insecurity Bill."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gas prices will skyrocket, and if that is what somebody here wants, they will be happy. Look, I am not happy with the deal that the Clinton administration cut. It was not a good deal, but a country cannot go about breaking its word. That is not the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the majority wants to do is what was done in "Animal House" after a freshman pledge's car was wrecked. He got an arm around his shoulders and the words, "Son, you messed up. You trusted me." That's not the way to run a government.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 1/2  minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are three titles in this bill. First deals with ways and means problems, those problems that have to do with taxes. We can have legitimate discussions on whether to tax or not tax corporations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third title deals with the renewable resources. Being from New Mexico, I think we should be exploring and investing in renewable resources. New Mexico is one of the few States that would be self-sufficient in wind and solar. We are making heavy investments in nuclear energy and in biomass, hydrogen, and geothermal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very committed to the section that the Democrats have on title III. The one I have deep reserves about is title II. In that title, page 10 says a lessee shall not be eligible to obtain the economic benefit of any covered lease, or any other lease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, what is occurring here is the piece that is referred to in yesterday's Washington Post editorial where the Democrats are described as being heavy handed. The stability of contracts that would be recognized and welcomed in Russia and Bolivia, I do not think that our friends on the other side of the aisle intended to do this. Therefore, I recommend that we kindly send this back to committee and we could take out these offenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the quality of a nation and its government depends on the full faith and credit of that government. This government depends on making promises that are not written to its seniors, to its veterans. Those promises are honored. But it also makes contractual promises, promises where companies are spending billions of dollars based on the contractual agreement that is there. If we are going to find a way out of those foolish mistakes made by the Clinton administration, I agree we need  to do it, but we do not need to do it in the way that they did in Venezuela and Bolivia and Russia. We need to go about it in a proper way. If we are going to punish people who did not voluntarily change a contract, we are no better than those countries that nationalize their industries.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our friends on the other side of the aisle have been talking a great deal about the so-called Contract With America. But what our experience has shown over the years is that was not a Contract With America but a contract with and for powerful special interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They allowed the drug companies, for example, to write a Medicare bill; and they have allowed the oil companies to determine energy policy in our country. That needs to change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All day long today they have been talking about how they don't like the idea that the oil companies have to pay their fair share of taxes even while they are making record profits and they have charged record prices at the pump and elsewhere for their product. It makes no sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The energy policy that they put in place beginning in 1995, and then made even worse in 2005, caused oil prices to increase dramatically because of their affiliation with the energy companies. We need to change that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this bill does is it takes bad policy and turns it into good policy. It takes policy that is based upon the interest of special interests, the oil companies, and changes it into policy that is based upon the big interests of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It takes as much as $14 billion over the course of the next 10 years and uses that money to promote energy conservation, alternative energy, to bring our country to a situation of increasing energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have been talking a great deal about how we are going to be importing more oil. Well, the fact of the matter is 60 percent of the oil that we use in our country today is imported from outside of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The product that we have in places such as the Gulf of Mexico is a very valuable product. It is owned by the American people. The value of that product is going to go up over time significantly. You just want to make it easier for the oil companies to take it now at a cheap price. We are against that.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, you know, in America, I still believe that a man's word is a man's word. And in America, contract rights are property rights. And the fifth amendment prohibits the government from taking away those property rights without due process and without just compensation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Democrat energy bill, contract rights are bona fide leases that are taken away. You cannot sell your lease, you cannot transfer your lease, you cannot derive any economic benefit from your lease until you open up your lease renegotiation. This is a complete elimination of value of these valid and binding contracts. The Supreme Court has long held that when this occurs property owners must be compensated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrat energy bill doesn't recapture the money lost from the Clinton administration's badly written leases, it just opens up the floodgates for takings litigation. This is a trial lawyer's dream bill. Federal takings claims and property disputes are notoriously long. They can take a long time to resolve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there was a bipartisan resolution and a vote in Congress to fix the lease mess, but last year's language was killed by the other body. It had a fix on the leases that would give back $10 billion to the American taxpayers. The Democrat bill, as written, will hurt offshore investment in drilling by American companies, which in turn does nothing to reduce our U.S. dependence on foreign energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are breaking our word with American companies who hold these leases and who have invested a lot of their money into drilling. In my opinion, Mr. Speaker, a man's word is a man's word, and a deal is a deal.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for too long Big Oil has benefited from weak royalty laws, huge tax breaks, and subsidies. Last year, the five biggest oil companies' profits were $97 billion, nearly five times their profit in 2002.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, which works to stop global warming by creating a fund that will support research in renewable energy sources and encourage energy efficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, the publishers of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, a group of prominent experts including physicist Lawrence Krauss of Case Western Reserve University, said we are perilously close to destroying the stability of our planet by ignoring the threat of climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Carbon dioxide levels are 27 percent higher now than at any point in 650,000 years, and 2006 registered as the warmest year in recorded history. We can no longer afford to postpone action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our need to act now is further enhanced by our Nation's dependence on foreign oil. Currently, we import 60 percent of our oil, and that number will increase to 75 percent in the next four years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With diminishing domestic oil reserves and growing instability in the Middle East, dependence on imported oil leaves our Nation vulnerable to volatility in foreign nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet we can reverse our course, and <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> takes a step toward doing so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CLEAN Act will create a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve, which will finance legislation that promotes renewable energy and energy efficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although 86 percent of America's energy comes from the burning of fossil fuels, a number of alternatives exist that are better for the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ohio is home to the largest wind turbines east of the Rockies, installed near Bowling Green. These utility-scale turbines produce 1.8 Megawatts of electricity. Honda and Iten Industries are currently studying developing wind farms at their facilities in Ashtabula and Logan counties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As part of its Sustainability Program, the City of Cleveland has partnered with Green Energy Ohio to study the feasibility of installing wind turbines on Lake Erie.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ohio is also a leader in biofuels. Most gasoline sold in Ohio contains 10 percent ethanol, and the Ohio Department of Development offers incentives for research in agricultural-based fuels. Ohioans are installing solar panels on their roofs to heat their water, buying hybrid cars to decrease fuel consumption, and building low-impact dams to produce hydro-power. The City of Cleveland is building new bike lanes to encourage commuters to leave their cars at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ohioans are committed to using cleaner energy, but doing so is expensive. The reserve  fund established by <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> would provide the means needed to pursue these environmentally sound strategies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This reserve will be financed by reinvesting money that used to go to large oil companies through tax breaks, allowing Congress to provide this fund without increasing the deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Critics of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> argue this measure will place an undue burden on oil companies, which will lead to higher gas prices. However, by helping reduce our dependence on oil and diversifying the source of energy for Americans, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> will lead to increased long-run fuel price stability. Even President Bush has said, "Energy companies do not need taxpayer funded incentives to explore for oil and gas."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other critics argue the threat of global warming has not been proved. Those in denial ignore the opinions of not only the scientific community, but of corporations such as Wal-Mart and General Electric, state and local governments around the country, and the National Academy of Sciences, who all agree that the fight to stop global warming must start now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> will not single-handedly solve our climate change problems, but it is one part of an elaborate strategy we must undertake in order to ensure that the planet we love will be here for our grandchildren's grandchildren.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague for yielding, and I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the CLEAN Energy Act. Today, our economy relies on fossil fuels for energy. We must simply change that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush admits we are addicted to oil, and this addiction is harming our country. The best way to beat this addiction is to stop using so much oil and gas by reducing demand, promoting renewables, and developing alternatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since America is not exactly awash in oil and gas, reducing our dependence upon them would be good not only for our environment but for the economy and our national security as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To be honest, though, we have to do more than just talk about the potential that renewables and alternative energy has for this country. We have to put in place more funding for programs to bring these energy sources to market. We have to make changes in energy policy to encourage their use. And that is exactly what <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the debate on the floor today, the minority side has described <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> as a takings. So let me remind all of us that when the House considered and passed the Jindal-Pombo OCS drilling legislation last June, 2006, no Republican Member challenged the conservation fee as a breach of contract or a taking. In fact, the Committee on Resources report on that legislation, <bill type="h" number="4761">H.R. 4761</bill>, states, and I quote, "this new fee addresses the mistakes made in leases issued in 1998 and 1999 where price triggers  for royalties were not included in the lease without violating contractual obligations of the United States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Americans want real meaningful solutions to our Nation's energy challenges. Big Oil has received more than its fair share of handouts. It is time we put taxpayer funds to more productive use. Let us pass the CLEAN Energy Act.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400313" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds just to point out that the conservation fee in this bill, contrary to the testimony we are hearing, applies to all leases, according to the language in the bill, and that clarification is a very important distinction.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to a valued member of our Natural Resources Committee, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400253" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his great work and for yielding, and I thank Mr. Hinchey, who has worked with me over the past 2 years to bring to the attention of the American people this issue of the fact that there is drilling going on off the shores of our public country on public lands where there are no royalties being paid, whether it is $30, $40, $50, $60, $70, or $80 a barrel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what President Bush said about that on April 19, 2005. "I will tell you, with $55 oil, we don't need the incentives to oil and gas companies to explore," Bush said in a speech in April.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what are we saying? We are saying keep your contracts. You don't have to change the contracts. Keep them. But if you want new contracts on new drilling sites, renegotiate the old contracts or pay a $9 fee. You can keep the sanctity of the old contracts, but you are not entitled to new contracts. Very simple.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, after the money is recollected, we are going to create a Renewable Energy Strategic Fund to change and put our country heading in a new direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the bill that we are considering today represents the important first step in charting a new direction for the nation's energy policy. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007, repeals the unnecessary and I wasteful tax breaks and royalty-free drilling rights for big oil and gas companies, and instead creates a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve that would invest in clean, renewable energy sources and clean alternative fuels like ethanol, as well as energy efficiency  and conservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when they are making record profits and American consumers are being tipped upside down at the pump we should not be giving massive subsidies and tax breaks to big oil companies. Even President Bush conceded in an April 19, 2005 Washington Post article, "I will tell you with $55 oil we don't need incentives to oil and gas companies to explore. *.*.* There are plenty of incentives." Even George Bush admits that at $55 dollars, the price of oil is enough of an incentive for oil companies  to drill and they don't need the additional taxpayer subsidies that were created under the Republican Congress. Today, with <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, we are simply going to repeal the most egregious of those unnecessary incentives and tax breaks to big oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> will put an end to oil companies drilling for free on public land when oil prices are high. The Government Accountability Office has estimated that the American taxpayers stand to lose at least $10 billion from leases issued in the late 90s that do not suspend so-called royalty relief. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> would correct this problem by barring oil companies from purchasing new leases unless they had either renegotiated their existing faulty leases or agreed to pay a fee on the production  of oil and gas from those leases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I have heard some Members on the other side of the aisle argue that if we were to pass the royalty relief fixes included in <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> and take back from big oil the $10 billion or more that rightfully belongs to the American people, it will violate the contracts that they are holding. That it will turn our country into Bolivia or Russia. But let me be clear--we have spoken to the top constitutional lawyers in the country and they all agree that we are on the firmest of constitutional ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The contracts that these oil companies are holding allow for the federal government to impose fees like the ones in this bill. Furthermore, the American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service has said time and time again that including a condition in new oil and gas leases to exclude oil companies that have not renegotiated their faulty leases would not abrogate existing contracts or  constitute a takings. All <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> does is give these big oil companies a choice--they can continue producing royalty-free oil no matter how high the price of oil climbs, that's fine, but then they're not going to get any new leases from the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And more than that, this House has already adopted the royalty relief fixes included in <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> by overwhelming, bipartisan votes. Many of my Republican colleagues voted for both of those provisions. The House adopted the Markey-Hinchey amendment to the Interior appropriations bill to provide an incentive for these companies to renegotiate by suspending their ability to bid on new leases by a vote of 252-165. The House also voted last year to impose a $9 per barrel fee on oil produced from these  leases in a bill authored by former Resources Chairman Pombo. That Pombo fee is this bill, and the Markey-Hinchey suspension on bidding for new leases is also there as an alternative. So, this is something that the House has already voted to do two times. Two times, this House has said that we want to put real pressure on all the oil and gas companies holding those 1998-1999 leases to renegotiate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the Bush Administration has consistently opposed our efforts to bring every oil  company holding one of these leases back to the negotiating table and it continues to oppose the provisions in <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> that would do so. Instead, the Bush Administration has argued that we should allow oil companies to "voluntarily" renegotiate with the Minerals Management Service. However, of the 56 companies holding these leases, only 5 have voluntarily agreed  to renegotiate. When billions of taxpayer dollars are at stake, that is simply not an acceptable rate of return. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> says that it is time for the oil companies to stop playing Uncle Sam for Uncle Sucker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to an Interior Department's Inspector General's report that came out today, senior officials at the Minerals Management Service have known about these faulty leases for nearly three years, yet sat idly by and did absolutely nothing while big oil companies failed to pay nearly $1 billion in royalties that rightfully belonged to the American people. If the allegations in the IG's report are true, top Bush Administration officials have aided and abetted one of the greatest heists in history.  We should not now leave those same officials in charge of getting oil companies to "voluntarily" renegotiate those same leases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally today, as part of the first 100 hours, we are starting the comprehensive debate about our nation's energy policy that we should have been having over the last 6 years. Finally today, we are beginning to talk about how we can radically increase the amount of renewable fuels such as ethanol we consume in the country. Finally today, we are beginning to talk on the Floor of the People's House about how to make our appliances or our buildings or our vehicles more energy efficient so that we  can reduce our consumption of foreign oil and our emissions of greenhouse gasses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adopting <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> will allow us to begin to move in a new, clean direction on energy and put an end to the free ride that big oil has had under the Bush Administration. This bill is a beginning. It is the beginning of a change in direction, away from subsidizing an industry that doesn't need extra financial incentives, and towards the technologies that do need a helping hand. Today, we have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve that we can tap to help American consumers in the event of another Middle East  oil embargo or crisis. But with this bill we create a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve, that we can tap to ensure that America can move towards energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge an "aye" vote on <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership in introducing this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are following through with our promise to hold big oil and gas companies accountable to the American people. Now, 6 years ago, when temperatures were spiking around the world, and the effects of global warming were raising alarm bells about the fate of the polar bear, the Vice President was holding secret meetings with energy executives and offering cozy deals and incentives to his Big Oil buddies.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that those days are over. By forcing oil and gas companies to pay their fair share for the natural resources that belong to us, we are recovering more than $14 billion of the taxpayers' money over the next 10 years.

At a time when you have national governments and international oil companies scouring the world to lock up resources, almost willing to do business with anybody in the world, doesn't matter if they are a dictator from the right or the left, at a time when  countries are out trying to get their hands on these resources, we suggest the only way you can get people to drill in the most secure area of the entire world is to give them a subsidy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, thank you. I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, I am pleased today to rise in support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>. Rural America is already leading the way towards reducing our dependence on foreign oil and generating electricity from renewable resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To encourage the growth of renewable energy production, the Agriculture Committee will be including an energy title in the farm bill that we will write this year; however, we currently have no baseline money to write that energy title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The funds created in the energy reserve in <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> will help us establish farm bill policies that will move us closer to energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of my top priorities for renewable energy in the farm bill will be funding for additional research and development on cellulosic ethanol, which I believe is the real key to achieving energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To begin the transition to cellulosic ethanol, we need to start growing cellulosic feedstocks so that we are ready to get the industry off the ground when the technology and infrastructure are in place to begin producing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To make this happen, we are going to propose a new farm bill program that will pay farmers and ranchers to begin growing cellulosic feedstocks, such as switch grass, sweet sorghum, miscanthus and other crops in actual, real-world settings. This will help us identify the best feedstocks that each region of the country can grow and supply to this new cellulosic ethanol industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we are learning how to grow the feedstocks that will fuel the cellulosic ethanol industry, we must also help get the first generation of cellulosic ethanol plants up and running. We hoped that the Department of Energy would issue the loan guarantees to start that process, but the unfinished appropriation process left over from the last Congress, it appears, makes that unlikely. So I am going to work with the other committees of relevance to determine what we need to do to help these first  cellulosic ethanol plants to be built and to be operational.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I am most interested in finding ways to encourage the move to cellulosic ethanol, we will also be looking for ways to make our current starch ethanol industry more efficient by supporting research on better use of by-products and better corn yields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we build on the success of the starch ethanol industry and as a value-added agriculture product, we need to continue to support one of our most important value-added industries in agriculture, our livestock industry. This industry has been one of the greatest value-added success stories in recent years, boosting income in our farming communities. We need to ensure that any renewable fuels policies that we pursue do not damage this important sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must also continue to grow our domestic biodiesel industry, so the Agriculture Committee will continue the CCC Bioenergy program, a farm bill  program that can also provide incentives for the cellulosic ethanol production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond the renewable fuel production, there are other policies that the Agriculture Committee will support to help our Nation's farmers and ranchers both conserve and produce more energy. For example, in the 2002 farm bill, we included a program to help farmers and ranchers make their operations more energy efficient. That program, known as the Section 9006 Program, also helps agriculture producers install methane digesters or wind turbines on their land to produce renewable energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we continue to consider the future of the energy production in the United States, we need to be sure that we can provide the technical expertise needed to plan and test all kinds of bio-based products, not just fuels, such as shirts made from corn fiber, which are produced in my district, and fast-food containers made from corn starch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my home State of Minnesota has been a leader in renewable energy, recognizing the growing needs for a growing industry. Many of our rural communities are coming alive with the excitement and the new investment that renewable energy has brought. I want to be sure that the rest of the country can benefit from this great experience that we have had in Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rural America stands ready to plant, grow and harvest the future of energy independence for our Nation. I encourage the support of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400154" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>. Like my colleagues, I believe we should find solutions to address the growing demand for energy, and I look forward to working with my colleague, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Mr. Peterson, to find new ways for American agriculture to provide increasing sources of domestic energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Republican-led Congress, I supported an energy bill that was signed into law that actually encouraged domestic energy production and lessened our dependence on foreign oil. Today's legislation, however, seems to dismantle any progress we have made in achieving energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, they don't agree with each other very often, they both condemn this legislation. The Wall Street Journal calls it the OPEC Energy Security Act: "This bill is said to promote America's energy independence, but the biggest winner may be OPEC. Raise taxes on domestic oil producers," it said. "Yes, raise the cost at the gas pump for American consumers. Raise the cost for American farmers who have to buy oil and natural gas to operate their farms.  Every American farmer has to do that."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Washington Post says: "This heavy-handed attack on the stability of contracts would be welcomed in Russia, Bolivia or other countries that have been criticized for tearing up revenue-sharing agreements with private energy companies." The Wall Street Journal again says: "So at the same time that the U.S. is trying to persuade Venezuela and other nations to honor property rights, Congress does its own Hugo Chavez imitation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Members have discussed passionately how America needs to decrease its dependence on foreign oil. In fact, many campaigned on promises to decrease our independence. But here we are in the midst of the Democratic leadership's first 100 hours considering a bill to increase America's dependence on foreign oil. This is dangerous policy for our national and economic security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation increases fees for domestic energy production and repeals for energy companies only the manufacturing tax deduction which was put in place to encourage domestic manufacturing and jobs from domestic production of goods. The manufacturing tax deduction was extended to all manufacturing to fix the problematic FSC-ETI problem, and was in no way a giveaway to the oil companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By singling out one industry alone, we are not righting a wrong. We are persecuting an industry and the people employed in that industry domestically. This is not attacks on foreign production in Venezuela or Iran or Saudi Arabia. This is attacks on American production of energy. Repealing these incentives makes it less economical to produce domestic energy and will compel companies to seek cheaper options abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While energy demands continue to rise, this bill would discourage domestic production, forcing the U.S. to import more foreign oil. While the proponents will tell you only oil companies will pay, the truth is every single one of us will pay the price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So why are we increasing the price of energy as well as our dependence on foreign oil? Those on the other side think this will help spur research for alternative energy. It is estimated that this bill robs about $14 billion over the next decade from domestic energy production. That is quite a lot of money. But where is the plan outlining how that money will be used? Sadly, there isn't one, thanks to a closed rule, with no amendments offered whatsoever time after time during this process, in contrast  with the Contract With America, where we allowed 154 Democratic amendments, 48 of which, by the way, passed and were included as a part of the Contract With America. In this process, that possibility of spelling that out is gone. There is no way to tell people how we can use this for more domestic production for renewable fuels, for example. Sadly, there isn't anything like that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill creates a $14 billion piggy bank or slush fund that we have been told will be used for future alternative energy legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to oppose this very bad legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, a piece of legislation that will move us towards energy independence. We are 65 percent dependent upon foreign energy, and we need to take advantage of our own natural resources. And in reference to the prior debate, that includes coal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only reason we do not have a coal-to-liquid plant in the United States of America right now has nothing to do with anyone in this Chamber on either side of the aisle, but it has directly to do with the Department of Energy that refuses to follow the letter of the law and enforce a loan guarantee of $100 million. If they would do that, we would have a coal-to-liquid plant right now in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the borough of Gilberton. We need to take advantage of all of our natural  resources. And serving as the vice chairman of the Agriculture Committee, I look forward to taking advantage of our agriculture natural resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairman and ranking member last year, when their roles were reversed, traveled around the country having hearings, trying to see what we need to do in the next farm bill. One thing was heard loud and clear, we need to take advantage of our own natural resources. And in the trip to Minnesota at the chairman's district, when we learned how far ahead the State of Minnesota is in ethanol production and cellulosic research, we understood right then what we need to do in writing this farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I rise in support of this legislation to give us the opportunity to do the research, to find the feedstocks to make us energy independent so we can, once and for all, not depend upon foreign energy and be independent and bring the price down.</paragraph>

This means that our Nation's energy security rests in the hands of the leaders of Iran, Venezuela, Algeria, Chad, Angola, Nigeria, and Russia. This state of affairs is unacceptable, and we must do all we can to change it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The way we change the situation is straightforward, but not easy. We need  to be more efficient with the energy we use to fuel our economy, heat our homes, and run our cars. We need to increase the use of alternative and renewable fuels, like ethanol and soy diesel, wind energy and nuclear power. We need to deploy new technologies that will allow us to make clean and efficient use of our nearly inexhaustible supplies of coal, and we need to look forward  to a new age where we can use the power derived from hydrogen-replaced fossil fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to say that on every one of these fronts, Congress has already acted. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, the first comprehensive energy bill in decades, provided significant incentives for renewable fuels, including the very successful and renewable fuel standard. It provided significant incentives for new nuclear power plants, energy-efficient buildings, solar and wind power, biomass and geothermal energy. It provides funding for FutureGen and other clean coal projects for research  into the use of hydrogen and fuel cells. And it provides loan guarantees for projects employing carbon sequestration, coal gasification and coal-to-liquids technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This landmark legislation moved us toward where we will ultimately need to be, a country less dependent on uncertain foreign sources of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with many of my colleagues that we need to do more. We need to ensure that this country can deploy nuclear power plants, that we can provide the power investment climate whereby clean coal-to-liquid plants can be built. And we need to push the deployment of E-85 infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we need to do all these things and more, but we also need a vibrant and effective energy sector in this country. We need to produce and develop our own energy. We need to open ANWR. We need to make more of our offshore resources available for development, and we need additional investment in energy infrastructure. What we do not need, Mr. Speaker, is a tax increase on domestic energy exploration, production and development. We do not need to make American energy less competitive  than energy produced overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And make no mistake about it, increasing taxes on our Nation's energy industry means one thing: more reliance on foreign oil and gasoline. I had the honor of being in Soviet Union, Russia, last fall; met with Premier Putin. He spent 2 1/2  hours talking about how Russia was going to combine and provide the energy for all of Europe and America if we wished to buy it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Incidentally, he wanted our investment dollars, he wanted companies to invest there. Higher taxes means we have less investment here, less exploration here, development of resources here at home, and more development dependence on energy derived from foreign sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we need to vote "no" on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> is shortsighted policy. Oil companies in recent years have made huge profits, no doubt about it. I, for one, have argued that they use these profits and re-invest them here in developing new energy projects and building new refineries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues on the other side of the aisle, however, want to punish such investment in America with new taxes. That is wrong, it is shortsighted and it won't work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Wall Street Journal noted, this is an energy bill only OPEC Ministers could love.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I agree with many of my colleagues that we should fix the Clinton Administrations mistake in not putting price thresholds in offshore leases granted to oil companies in 1998 and 1999.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I voted, along with many of you, to correct this mistake. But I do not agree with my Democrat colleagues that we should punish investment in our Nation's energy resources and infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Far from punishing Big Oil we are only punishing ourselves. I urge my colleagues to vote "no."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank my distinguished friend, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, for giving me time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the CLEAN Energy Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation. When we passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress put the interests of Big Oil ahead of enacting a comprehensive energy bill for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we begin to right that wrong by repealing $14 billion in giveaways in tax loopholes to Big Oil. We are also repealing a provision which suspended the royalty fees from oil and gas companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. We simply cannot let these companies off the hook for reaping record profits without paying their fair share.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will then invest these funds in clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency and create a Strategic Renewable Energy Reserve which will also promote new energy technologies and improve energy conservation. The 110th Congress presents us with a new opportunity to advance forward-thinking 21st century energy policy. As a matter of national security we must wean ourselves off of foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be reintroducing the bipartisan Engel/Kingston DRIVE Act, also known as the Fuel Choices for American Security Act. I hope we pass that bill as well.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400154" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King), a member of the committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400220" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> for a whole series of reasons. The gentleman addressed Vladimir Putin, who just nationalized $20 billion worth of Shell Oil Company's investment. You get a sense of what we have when you have those countries taking over the private investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, for one, don't object to profits that go into companies like Exxon, Chevron, Shell, companies that take their profits and reinvest them back into research and development and exploration. That is why oil went from $75 a barrel down to $53 a barrel, and the trend is on back down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill sends it the other way. I happen to represent Iowa, and Iowa produced 26 percent of the ethanol in the United States of America. That is number one of the States in the United States. We have a Nation that eclipsed Brazil in ethanol production. We have over $1 billion in private capital investment just in my congressional district for the 2006 construction season for renewable energies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That tells me that research and development is coming in the private sector. They are producing enzymes in the private sector. They will catch up, and they will take care of the cellulosic ethanol. The government does a poor job of investing those dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the CLEAN Energy Act. We need a balanced energy policy in this country. This bill hurts agriculture and renewable fuels, small petroleum companies and well as the energy sector. This bill that affects every man, woman and child in America was not even given committee consideration. I guess an iron fisted rule from the Democrats is what we have come to expect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the liquid hydrocarbon sector supplies more then 99 percent of fuel used by Americans for transportation and operation of businesses. They produce the diesel fuel used by farmers in my district to run their tractors and combines. These are tractors and combines that plant and harvest our food in America. Natural gas is also the major cost in Nitrogen fertilizer farmers in my district use to grow corn. Corn, Mr. Speaker, is the major feedstock for ethanol in this country followed  only by natural gas. This bill will hurt America's farmers by making them pay more for fuel to grow food and more for fertilizer to grow more ethanol. One last point, asphalt is made from petroleum. Asphalt is used for roads. Roads are used to transport grain to market and children to school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wonder if the Democrats realize they will be putting additional strain on local and State governments, the largest buyers of asphalt, who will then have to raise taxes to cover their cost. To recap, this bill raises operational costs of farming in my district by making fuel and fertilizer more expensive. In addition, farmers will get hit by increased taxes from their local and country governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While recovering royalties from the 98-99 lease issue seems like a politically friendly catch phrase, I would like to make two points on this issue. Recently, Russia forced Shell to hand over a $20 billion project. The Democrat plan to force producers to renegotiate their lease royalties or be barred from future leases is blackmail of American oil companies. This blackmail stems from a mistake from a Democrat administration. Maybe the Democrats are taking a page from Putin's energy policy playbook.  They make American petroleum companies fear blackmail on two continents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Have the Democrats given any consideration to what this legislation will do to small business? Large companies are somewhat cushioned against these types of blows. Small independent oil producers are not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If they are forced into bankruptcy or mergers, all the Democrats have done is to consolidate petroleum production into fewer hands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, America is importing a large sum of petroleum from unstable countries. By importing this petroleum, America is enriching her enemies. Importing oil is a fact of life right now. Since I have been in Congress, I have been saying that we need to produce more BTU's here in America. Section 345 of the 2005 Energy bill contained incentives for petroleum producers to venture into deep water. In September 2006 Chevron discovered an oil field 270 miles south-west of New Orleans. This field  is projected to increase America's proven reserves by 50 percent. I don't know if Chevron took advantage of Section 345 but it sure would make it easier to convince the accountants of the need to head to deep water. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> repeals section 345. The test-well that Chevron had to drill to find this new field cost them $100 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats will no doubt point out the revenues reported in the media as justification for this legislation. I'm curious if the Democrats will acknowledge that the media has reported the gross revenue of oil companies. Not the net profits, but the gross receipts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former small business owner, I wish to remind my Democrat colleagues about simple economics about how to calculate how much profit is made. The GROSS revenue are profits before bills are paid. Once the bills are paid, the net revenues of oil companies are very much in line with other industries as stated by Congressman COLE earlier today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the debt that oil companies pay is to shareholders. With the recent run-up in oil prices, oil companies have been a profitable sector to invest. When Democrat's take a bite out of the oil companies, they are taking a bite out of 401(k) plans, retirement plans and pension funds. Any tax increase on oil companies will hurt retirees and stockholders. Right now over seventeen million people rely on those funds for their retirement security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I realize that this bill contains a section that will use royalty money for renewable research. Yet, there is no provision that would prevent this account from being raided for other projects. Most of my colleagues know that Iowa is not only a consumer of energy, but a producer of energy. The Fifth District of Iowa is an energy export center, exporting ethanol and biodiesel all across this Nation. Rest assured the American consumer is driving renewable demand. It is also driving research. Ethanol  is good to invest in. Ethanol companies realize that more investment means more money. Ethanol companies also realize that more ethanol means more money for investors. In order to maximize ethanol production companies are doing research to increase the yield of ethanol from feedstock. Rural investors raise money for new ethanol plants in days. Mr. Speaker, if the Democrats want research to happen for renewable energy, then clear the way of burdensome regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker as I conclude, I wish to reiterate, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> sounds good, but it will do nothing but drive up energy prices for the American consumer. The American consumer, who drives to work, drives kids to wrestling practice, the independent truck driver driving more miles to make ends meet. It will make it harder for the American consumer living on a fixed income to make ends meet. I ask my colleagues to join with the American consumer and oppose <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is an argument that has been going on for a long time, when I was a young boy, since the 1970s, talking about reducing our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of this bill for cutting big oil subsidies and investing in our homegrown energy sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to think of an analogy that this is much like when I was trying to teach my daughter how to ride a bicycle. Had training wheels on a small Stingray. She road like that, and I ran behind her with my hand on the back of the seat. Then at the point she was ready, I let her go. She could ride, and she rode well. I think these companies and these big oil companies are ready to ride on their own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think it is time we get serious about kicking our dependence on foreign oil, relying on homegrown sources like we grow in Indiana, corn and soybeans.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a tough vote for some of us here this afternoon. For me, I support greater spending, spending for alternative fuel, so that we can lessen our dependence on foreign oil. For me I am appalled at the ineptness and bungling of the Interior Department's troubled program to collect royalties on oil and gas and public lands in both the Clinton and Bush administrations. It needs to be investigated, and it needs to be remedied.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But other items in this legislation, specifically the repeal of section 199, which will likely drive more refinery production elsewhere overseas, and thus more jobs, is not right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Joe Barton was chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, he was rightly proud of the process. It was open and, indeed, bipartisan. Lots of debate, Democrats and Republicans, and lots of amendments were accepted, Democrats and Republicans, and the proof was in the pudding. We passed a bipartisan bill, energy bill, which included the vote of Mr. Dingell, the chairman today of the Energy and Commerce Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nobody saw this bill until late last week. No hearings, no markup in subcommittee or full committee, no amendments on the House floor allowed. We know this bill is going to pass, but listening to the debate, I know it could have been a much better bill and one that could have been called bipartisan, and it would pass by a much larger margin than it will this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maybe the margin of the vote could have helped us with the Senate to actually get the bill to the President's desk for his signature, rather than a veto. I urge my Republican colleagues to vote "no" so that we can truly pass a bill that will do something for our constituents in our country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of this bill, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the capstone of the Democrats 100-hour agenda for America, and it is also a significant step towards fulfilling our commitment to meeting our Nation's growing energy needs with clean, homegrown, renewable sources. This bill will redirect roughly $14 billion of taxpayers's money to help fund important existing renewable energy programs, accelerate the development of new and more aggressive renewable energy initiatives and technologies and promote energy efficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The biofuels industry, though still in its infancy, is already providing much needed income to thousands of family farmers and rural citizens across the Great Plains and across the Midwest. It has proven to be a vital economic lifeline to hundreds of communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the tip of the iceberg. This bill will provide additional funding to further advance research and development in order to greatly diversify the feedstock used to produce biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol. This will include not only dedicated energy crops, but also crop residue, municipal waste, woody biomass and a whole source of other inexpensive renewable sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The benefits that will flow from this bill are broader than just biofuels. It can also promote the development of wind energy in this country. In addition to having considerable corn and biomass resources for the production of biofuels in my home State of South Dakota, we also have been blessed with an abundance of wind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, the Dakotas have been called the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. For decades wind energy development in this country has been hamstrung by inadequate and erratic Federal support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact long-term incentives to provide the certainty and the resources to vastly increase the role of wind in our Nation's energy picture. This bill reprioritizes our national energy policy and our future investments in a way that recognizes the unique challenges, but also the undeniable strengths of rural America. We truly have the solution to our national energy crisis growing in and blowing over our fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This bill is a strong statement of our commitment to an energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil, benefits the environment, enhances our national security, and revitalizes rural America's economies, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me congratulate Speaker Pelosi and the House Democratic leadership for bringing this legislation to the floor for a new direction for America's energy independence. Last Congress, I had the honor of serving with Congresswoman STEPHANIE HERSETH as co-chairs of the Speaker's Rural Working Group. Working with leaders like Chairman COLLIN PETERSON, we identified biofuels as a win-win for America's energy needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past few years, as gas prices have steadily risen higher and higher, there has been no significant legislation passed in this body to gain our energy independence. Anyone who has filled up his or her gas tank in the past year knows that gas prices are highly volatile and really too high for the average American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet while Americans are struggling to make ends meet, oil companies are making record profits. As a former small businessman in North Carolina and as a part-time farmer, I believe it is our duty to find alternatives for what can become a dangerous reliance on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me be clear, our Nation has the capacity to gain its energy independence. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> will promote this by creating a renewable fuel standard requiring that, by 2015, 15 percent of our fuels be renewable. This legislation will also extend and expand tax credits for ethanol and biodiesel. It will extend loan guarantees to farmers to produce renewable energy, and it will increase and expand tax credits to promote the use of flex fuel vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we have the technology to solve our energy crisis growing in our fields. We have the ability to turn soybeans and peanuts, both grown in large amounts, I should say, in my home State of North Carolina, into biodiesel, and the technology to turn sugar cane and corn into ethanol. What we haven't had up to this point is the leadership to develop the infrastructure needed to facilitate the use of these fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation before us today will begin to do just that. I encourage my colleagues to vote for <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the need to move our Nation toward energy independence has never been clearer, yet this administration has stood by, leaving consumers struggling to pay their winter heating bills as oil companies continue to enjoy billions in record profits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this legislation, we can recover $14 billion in unnecessary oil and gas subsidies and target that money toward where it should have been going all along, into renewable energy sources created right here at home, into alternative fuels grown on our farms and energy-efficiency technologies, creating jobs, protecting our consumers and our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could generate over 800,000 jobs by 2010, jobs from the Great Plains to the Northeast. In Bethlehem, Connecticut, we have the first biodiesel production plant in New England, in partnership with Maryland and Delaware soybean growers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By supporting this legislation, we have an opportunity to begin bridging the cultural, economic and social divide growing between rural America and other parts of the country. It starts with investments. It starts with this bill. Let us take control of our energy policy. Let us put our country on the path to energy independence and reenergize our farm economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's pass this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the day when we can work across the aisle to do what I have heard so many of the speakers here today talk about doing in terms of encouraging greater production of renewable energy here in the  United States. The committee will look forward to doing that, indeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this legislation doesn't do it. Unfortunately, it doesn't do it because of the very closed rule that we pointed out throughout the Democrats' 100 hours; no openness whatsoever, in contrast to the Contract with America, when Democrats offered 154 amendments. In fact, 48 were adopted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could have spelled out in good legislation, if it had been through the committee process and we had held hearings and markups in each of the committees represented here today, to say what we were going to use this money for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, instead, what we are asked to do is vote for a tax increase on domestic production of energy, no tax increase on Venezuela and Hugo Chavez, no tax increase on Iran, no tax increase on any Middle Eastern country, no jobs lost over there, but jobs lost in the United States and American consumers paying for it at the gas pump and American farmers and ranchers paying for it with increased energy cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oppose this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have been around agriculture all my life, and I have never seen the excitement that is generated by this opportunity, because not only are we going to have economic benefits; we are going to help get this country off oil dependence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The internal combustion engine and diesel engine were invented to run on alcohol and peanut oil. They went to gasoline because it was cheaper and I guess more available. Well, times have changed and we are going back to the future, and this legislation is going to give us the opportunity and the resources to do that.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a father of a 5-year-old daughter, I am deeply concerned about the future of our country. I am concerned that our children could be the first generation of Americans that do not have a better quality of life than their parents. I am concerned about the availability of quality jobs for our children. I am concerned that our country's competitive position in the world will continue to deteriorate. And I am concerned that our country will not have access to energy supplies needed  to sustain our economy and our growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For far too long, our country has relied on foreign sources of oil to meet our energy needs. This dependency is bad for our economic security, it is bad for our national security, it harms our ability to create new quality jobs, and it harms our ability to maintain our competitive position in the world. Ten years from now, I want to look at my daughter and know that I did my part to find a solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we are considering today will make a significant down payment for the development of new energy technologies. A stable domestic energy supply is essential to economic well-being and security of our Nation. For years, we have been chipping away at energy policy, increasing production here, a tax incentive there, funding energy R&amp;D when it is convenient, and letting programs languish when it is not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time we think of new ways to approach this problem. Replacing traditional energy sources requires an unprecedented basic research and development technology effort. We must be a world leader, developing new technologies and sustainable energy sources that will maintain our competitive position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Science and Technology Committee, you have my commitment that our committee will be doing our part. We will be working to use R&amp;D to accelerate the production and use of new biofuels, increase the use of renewable energy, like solar, wind, geothermal, and boost energy efficiency in part by making the Federal Government a model of conservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will not ignore the potential contribution of clean coal, carbon capture and storage technologies and better, cleaner ways to produce oil and gas. And we will not shy away from engaging in a thoughtful dialogue of the role of nuclear power. In these ways, we will help ensure a strong, secure energy future for our children and help manufacturers keep jobs here by ensuring a stable, reliable, and affordable energy supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I will have the privilege of yielding my time to the next generation of leaders in the energy debate. These new members of the Committee on Science and Technology came to Washington to change things and to make a difference. This is their chance. This is their opportunity to leave a legacy that includes the creation of a reasonable, balanced, and effective energy policy for years to come. I am proud I can join with them in supporting this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today, of course, in opposition to <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>. While I would like to believe that we all have the same goal in creating energy independence for our country, I really regret that this bill before us today would not lead us to that goal. This is really, I am very fearful, just the initial attack or one of the early attacks on an industry that is going to have other attacks this year, that survived the windfall profit tax that passed during the Jimmy Carter years of disaster, as  far as energy was concerned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This energy act is more likely to increase the dependence on foreign oil. By decreasing after-tax revenues for oil and gas companies, including the small independent producers that are considered small businessmen, the effect will be an increase in the cost of energy to consumers and a decrease in domestic exploration and production of oil and natural gas, because companies will have less money available to them for their activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This will, of course, require our country to import more oil and natural gas from countries that are not our natural allies. We will be dependent on these countries and to the OPEC group to supply us with the lifeblood of our economy. I just can't in good conscience vote for anything that would have that type of outcome.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have said all along that this country will fight for energy, and the way to prevent our sons and daughters and grandsons and granddaughters from having to go overseas to take some oil away from someone or another country is to ensure that we utilize our own natural resources efficiently and effectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am well aware that drilling alone on U.S. soil is not going to quickly solve all of our problems. I know that we also need to expand our usage of renewable energy and increase the efficiency of how we use fossil fuels. This is why I am supportive of the legislation that passed last Congress on a voice vote under suspension of the rules by my colleague from Illinois, Congresswoman Biggert. Among other initiatives, her bill supports the development and advancement of renewable energy  in areas such as solar, wind, biofuels, coal, and encourages energy efficiency in buildings and technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am fully supportive of seeing these initiatives enacted now. We have unanimous bipartisan support. Why do we need to wait for "subsequent legislation," as is stated in the Rahall bill? Let's not wait any longer to ensure energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States has substantial amounts of oil and natural gas, but our laws prevent our domestic companies from accessing these resources in both onshore and offshore areas. In fact, we are the only country in the world that has limited ourselves like this. If our goal really is energy independence, then we need to increase access to our domestic resources, not increase taxes on one industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The point to remember here is that the Tax Code has little to do with the increase in energy prices. So penalizing oil and gas companies by increasing their taxes is not going to solve our energy problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake, this country will fight for energy, and if we have to we  will send our sons and daughters across the ocean to take energy away from someone when we have plenty right here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us help our constituents, not hurt them. Vote against <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>. When I was campaigning last year back in Indiana, people found it incredible that while they were paying $3 a gallon for gasoline Congress was giving the oil companies a tax cut. They wanted change because of those kinds of things that Congress was doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, today, they are going to get their change. Instead of giving tax cuts to oil companies we are going to pour those resources into renewable energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home State of Indiana boasts two premier research universities, Indiana University and Purdue University. Both of these schools have renowned research labs that study a wide range of topics, including alternative energy creation and use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indiana has a lot to contribute to the field of alternative energy. My constituents are very involved in biodiesel oil production. It is important to remember this source of alternative energy, as well as ethanol and hydrogen when deciding what types of initiatives to support with the new clean energy fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill that will help make the United States truly energy independent.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400005" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to be able to discuss the question here about our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The leadership in the House of Representatives because of the last election has changed, but the problems that confront our Nation remain the same. The question is how are we going to deal with our dependence on foreign oil, and that is a serious question for many reasons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, there are different ways to approach it, but it is certainly hard for the party of the Democrats that are now in charge to advocate a lot of nuclear because they have a lot of people who do not like that. Very well. And they really do not like burning a lot of fossil fuels because of global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, what tool are we going to use? Well, we use our favorite tool, a tax increase. The only trouble with a tax increase, though, is what it is going to do is it is going to make the problem worse because when you increase the taxes on American oil and gas by $10 billion you make it less competitive, and if they are less competitive that means OPEC fills in the gap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, is this just about the problem of $3 gasoline? The answer is no. It is about a lot more than that. When you go over to the Middle East, particularly a human rights trip that I took about a year or two ago to Pakistan, what you find is that there is a very nice country by the name of the Saudis who are funding private education so the little kids in Pakistan can learn. Well, until you find out what they are learning. They are being trained to be radical Islamic terrorists. And who is funding  this? Saudi oil money, OPEC oil money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this question before us today is not just about SUV owners paying $3 for gasoline. It is a question about where is that money going and the radical Islamists that we are going to fund essentially with this tax increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is a bill that is trying to deal with a problem that is a serious problem, but a tax increase is not the way to go.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the CLEAN Energy Act, because it is time for Congress to do more than talk when it comes to investing in clean and renewable energy sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this last election, the American people asked to repeal billions of dollars in indefensible tax giveaways to big oil and invest in new, clean energy technologies that will reduce our dependence on foreign sources of fuel, and this is what we are doing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are keeping our promise to the American people and we are meeting our obligation to our grandchildren and future generations of Americans by improving our national security and protecting our environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there is another important benefit we are talking about today, and this is an important step in growing the American economy and creating good, high paying jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By investing in research and development for solar, wind and other sources of clean energy, we will be tapping the potential of our Nation's most innovative minds and best engineers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly excited about investing in solar energy because I believe my State of Arizona can one day be the Middle East of solar energy, and instead of importing energy we can export it around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill puts us on the right path.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400342" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is a three-legged stool if we are going to get to energy independence. It is alternatives fuels, which there is great promise. There is also the expansion of refineries. We knew that early, and if we were going to have a stable supply and cheaper prices, we needed more refining capability in America. And it was domestic production. You need all three so that we do not send more money to Ahmadinejad and Chavez.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Political theater is what we see here today. A bill that did not go through the committee process gives you this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree, giving $400 million to a CEO of which they had no material stake in a company is wrong, but what is worse is giving more money to the very people who are targeting the United States and seek our destruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do not fool yourself. This is where this money is going. You make it more expensive to refine gasoline in the United States, this bill does it, they will buy it offshore. You make it more expensive to produce energy in the United States, they will buy it offshore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These will be the recipients of these dollars. Let us take this bill back and go do it the right way. We can come together on renewable energy. Michigan State University is doing great work on cellulosic research, so we can get to that next generation of ethanol that burns efficiently in American-made automobiles. But we cannot do it if we are sending money to the very people that seek our destruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would strongly urge that we have a little common sense, we close the curtain to this political theater and we get back to the reality of what our policies will really mean for the future of this country. If you care about your children, stop sending the money to Ahmadinejad and Chavez.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the energy policy in this country is neither sustainable nor healthy. Every day we import $800 million worth of oil, and not only does that put our economy at great risk, but some of that money is going to the very people who would harm us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our vote today in <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007, will begin moving towards a rational and sustainable energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After spending more than 20 years climbing wind turbines and developing new energy technology, I can tell you that we have not even begun to realize the potential for jobs creation and sustainability in this industry. We need to be doing much more to expand the use of renewable energy. This bill is a first step to diversify our energy sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> we will end billions of dollars of corporate welfare that we  have doled out to big oil companies currently enjoying record profits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By investing in new energy technologies, we will also create an entire spectrum of good paying jobs right here in America. In fact, the passage of this bill will produce nearly 1 million jobs, generating close to $30 billion in new wages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that we are doing more than just paying lip service to expanding innovation and clean energy by following through with our responsibility to make the environment livable for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working in a bipartisan way with my colleagues on the Science and Technology Committee to increase innovation and investment in our energy future.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400052" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the bill on the floor. Supporters of the bill claim that this will boost our energy independence, promote the use of renewable and alternative energy, but looking at this bill, you really cannot find anything that will help us accomplish those goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, there are four provisions in this bill that will make us more, not less, dependent on foreign oil by making it more difficult and more expensive to produce the needed energy here in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill specifically disallows energy companies from receiving the domestic manufacturing tax deduction, thereby making it more expensive for them to do business in the United States and more likely that we will be buying our oil from someone outside this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Higher energy taxes will be passed on to the consumers in the form of higher gasoline and in the form of higher home energy prices. Similarly, heavy users of oil and natural gas, such as other manufacturers and agricultural producers, will feel the pinch of these higher prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I just cannot help but note the irony that film makers will continue to be eligible for this manufacturing deduction, yet in my district I have not had a single constituent complain about our increasing dependence on foreign film.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today would repeal the royalty incentives put in place under last Congress' Energy Policy Act of 2005 to encourage the energy production in hard-to-reach and technologically challenging places such as the ultra deepwater Gulf of Mexico and offshore Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Gulf of Mexico delivers more oil and more natural gas to United States markets than any other single source. Since approximately 97 percent of America's coasts are off limits for energy production, energy companies are forced to explore for and produce from increasingly difficult-to-reach places.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The incentives included in the energy bill we passed in August of 2005, which now would be repealed by the Democrats, encouraged production in the Gulf of Mexico that will help the Nation meet the production needs of the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that unlike the 1998-1999 Clinton leases, under every provision in the energy bill, where royalty relief is granted, the Secretary of the Interior is granted the authority to set those price thresholds, to set those price triggers based upon market price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Producers would not and do not receive royalty relief through the energy bill of 2005 under today's price climate. These provisions provide energy companies with some price certainty, a price floor that they need, that it is necessary to make to justify the billion dollar investments in America's energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill creates a new Strategic Energy Efficiency Renewables Reserve but does not specify how those funds would be used. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the increased use of renewable and alternative energy. In fact, Texas has a strong State renewable energy portfolio and is the largest producer of wind energy in the United States, but before we cast our votes today let us be sure what we understand that the bill is for. It is for partisan advantage, not for the good of the American people.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in proud support today of the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007. My constituents in upstate New York know what it is like to have to pay more than most people in the country for energy. They also know what it is like to have to deal with winters that are more severe, and they know that during those winter months they have to adjust their budget to be able to handle the added expense for fuel costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But they also know that prices will continue to rise if something is not done to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>However, we must address our long-term energy demands with more than just short-term solutions. We have to face the facts, and the fact is that oil is a finite resource. We ought to be investing in a wide array of clean energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The giveaways this legislation will reclaim from oil and gas industry will be placed into a renewable energy account to fund research and development of alternative fuels, providing a much needed new direction to address our Nation's growing energy needs.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I want to thank my friend from Texas for yielding some time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, where I come from in southeast Texas, that area of the State is called the energy capital of the world. We have numerous refineries, petrochemical plants, and hundreds of offshore rigs. Energy byproducts from these areas are shipped all over the country, even to States that won't allow refineries and, heaven forbid, those offshore rigs near their shores.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a tax bill, and Economics 101 says when you tax something, you get less of it. Now, we will get less energy because of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This tax bill will discourage energy independence. It will increase gasoline prices; it will discourage American exploration; it will increase dependence on foreign countries and OPEC; it will cost Americans jobs, especially those in my district. It takes money and invests it in alternative energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Investment is a politically correct word for Federal subsidies for special interest groups. Alternative energy is necessary, but this bill doesn't do that, and this bill breaks a contract this government signed. Now we want to legalize contract breaking with oil companies like they do in Bolivia and Venezuela.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So if this bill passes, Americans need to get their checkbooks out because Americans are going to pay more at the pump. Americans always have to pay.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am thrilled today to speak on this final piece of legislation of our first 100 hours and perhaps the most important piece of legislation, the CLEAN Energy Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the early 1960s, in response to the Russians when they launched Sputnik, President Kennedy decided to send a man to the Moon. And remember his words. He said: "We choose to go to the Moon. We choose to go to the Moon in this decade, not because it's easy, but because it's hard." And we did it and we led in science and math and engineering, and it was greatness for our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These policies led to a major technological breakthrough that benefited  both our military and our economy; and now America faces a greater challenge than ever. How we respond to this challenge will have lasting effects not just for the American people but for the entire world. We put our national security at risk when we are reliant on unstable regimes, Middle Eastern oil, Latin American oil. We put our economy at risk by not adequately investing in science  and math and engineering and technology, and we put our world at risk when we ignore the real threats of global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ending America's addiction to foreign oil, investing in renewable energy, and achieving clean energy independence is the Apollo mission of our generation. This will not just result in better jobs and the creation of hundreds of thousands of new economic opportunities for our citizens, but a more stable and a more sustainable world. The CLEAN Energy Act is a meaningful first step in our new mission, and I look forward to working with both Republicans and Democrats in achieving this goal.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I recognize the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Kingston) for 3 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400221" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there is one economic fact that doesn't belong to the Democrats or the Republicans. Facts work that way. And that is, that price in the long run is the cost of production, period. It is true with anything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are doing with this bill, should it pass, is we are increasing the cost of production, specifically, domestic production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We live in a world where, in 2004, we spent $103 billion buying oil from nondemocratic countries. Now, some of them might be your best friends. Saudi Arabia, for example. Others might be less than your best friends. Of course, I say that tongue in cheek. But Iran, Iraq, Russia, Venezuela, that is who you are buying your oil from today; and you are going to increase the cost of domestic production. It doesn't quite make sense, except for in the context of the last 2 weeks, the context of the transfer  of power from Republican to Democrat. We were promised open government; we were promised open rules; we were promised the opportunity to add amendments and to have fair debates. And yet this bill, as has been the case with the five bills before it, did not even have a committee hearing. It is like giving a book report having not read the book.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sure, it is a power jam, and certainly the majority has the right to jam its power through on the minority. But in this case, wouldn't it have been more helpful to have a committee hearing so we could have gotten rid of what I would call the tuna fish clause?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we know what the tuna fish clause is. Right? That is where we heard over and over again on the minimum wage debate that increasing wages was good for everybody, good for the economy, good for the worker, particularly the poor worker. And then we read this insidious, surreptitious scheme to exempt American Samoa and the tuna worker factories. Sorry, Charlie, but only the best tuna workers are entitled to minimum wage, not the folks on American Samoa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, that is the tuna fish clause. Now, frankly, I think other States ought to have that option, too. We found out there was a tuna fish clause yesterday in the education bill; and that was that the title of the bill was to decrease the student loan interest rate down to 3.4 percent, but the tuna fish clause in it said that it was only applied for 6 months of the bill. How do you go back home and tell people you cut student loan rates in half when you only did it for 6 months? It is a tuna fish  clause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How do you tell the American people that you are going to have open government, and yet your first six bills bypass the committee process? That is the tuna fish clause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today the tuna fish clause is that our domestic oil production is low in terms of our consumption, and we are going to be increasing the cost of the production, which will be passed on to the American consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do need alternative energy. We need it on a bipartisan basis. I would say to the majority, you missed a great opportunity to work on this.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400412" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, and I am compelled to respond to some of the criticisms of the Members of the other party about the intent of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear that the oil and gas industry is doing quite well. There are a number of tax breaks, tax credits, tax deductions, and encouragements that are already in place. This bill says the short-term benefits that were extended to the oil and gas community are overridden, and that the royalty problems that we have had are going to be revised and solved so that taxpayers get a fair return on their investments. After all, we own these assets as the people of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This starts us finally on the right path by creating a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve. It says we will set aside $14 billion to invest in clean energy technologies. And as the Chair of the bipartisan Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus, I can tell you that these are crucial technologies not only to protect our environment but to ensure job creation and, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, to ensure our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to stand in strong support of this legislation. We ought to pass it. The country is for it, and Democrats and Republicans are for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to echo the views of many of my colleagues who have talked about the importance of diversifying and balancing our energy portfolio and moving toward a clean energy regime. We all know that energy security and national security go hand in hand, and right now we don't enjoy either. That's why--as part of the 100 Hours agenda--we are passing this important legislation. We need a national effort to address our reliance on foreign energy sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> starts us finally on the right path by creating a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve. The CLEAN Energy Act would set aside roughly $14,000,000,000 to invest in clean renewable energy resources and alternative fuels, promote new energy technologies, and improve energy efficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As co-chair of the bi-partisan Renewable Energy &amp; Energy Efficiency Caucus, I can tell you that renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies can increase our energy security AND allow us to think anew about our energy future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This isn't just about doing right by the environment--this is also about creating jobs. The U.S. currently leads the world technology in developing advanced energy technologies. But we won't hold onto the lead for long unless U.S. government policies begin to favor their development more than they do now. With the world market for new energy technologies projected to be in the trillions of dollars in twenty years, we would be foolish to forgo this opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it is an opportunity--for new jobs, for rural development, for a cleaner environment, for national security. States and localities have realize this, and with federal action at a standstill, many of them--like my state of Colorado--have already acted on renewable portfolio standards and other forward-looking policies. Now Congress is in a position to follow their lead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will use this strategic fund to extend the renewable energy production tax credit to give the market the assurance it needs to respond. We can extend energy efficiency tax incentives for buildings. equipment, and appliances, We can invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency research programs at the Department of Energy, and make sure that the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has enough money and enough staff to do its important work. It is these programs that can drive down costs,  make commercialization of new technologies possible, and help retain America's leadership role in these technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The best thing about investing in clean energy is that Americans support it. This Administration supports it. Democrats and Republicans alike support it. It is the right thing to do.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas, and I yield myself the balance of my time and his time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, most of my life I have heard of red herrings. Today, I got to hear about a red tuna.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is amazing to me to think that the opponents of this bill could categorize it as sending money overseas. The fact of the matter is what we are doing is we are going to be developing an energy efficiency, an alternative energy, renewable energy in this country so we don't have to send money overseas. It is just the reverse. And not only are we doing that, we are doing it in an economically responsible way in that we are paying as we go. And that is the reason that we are taking these unneeded  tax breaks and using them to help us to develop a new type of energy for this country, new jobs for my children, for your children, and for our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I encourage Democrats and Republicans alike to support this good bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400313" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker and fellow House Members, let's take a look at what we are doing here today. The Democrats say that they are reducing America's dependence on oil by investing in clean, renewable, and alternative resources. Both goals, I agree, are admirable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the process, they are trying to unravel a very thorny problem of contracts that were badly negotiated by the Clinton administration, contracts that the Clinton administration made no attempt to remedy. But let's look at what is actually occurring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In title I, we are penalizing American oil and gas companies and rewarding foreign companies by taxing them differently. That is, we are going to favor foreign jobs and foreign oil over domestic jobs and domestic oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second thing we are doing is charging a conservation fee on U.S.-produced oil while protecting foreign oil from this tax. Now, again, this is $9. If I could get the House to focus on the percentages for just a moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If $9 is added on top of the $70 charged to a production company that is making $70 a barrel, that is about 12.8 percent. But already the price of oil has fallen to about $52. And if $9 is assessed into a $50-a-barrel revenue stream, then it is 18 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what happens if the price of oil falls to $30? I would remind my constituents that as little as 3 1/2  years ago the price of oil was actually at $20. And there, you now have a fee on top of the taxes that is 45 percent. A 45 percent fee will begin to move exploration away from this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1999 and 2000, I was in an oil and gas company that did repairs for oil and gas wells. The price of oil fell to $6. At that point, our fee is going to be 150 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is extraordinarily prescriptive in declaring not a percent, but instead a fixed fee. It disadvantaged tremendously the production of oil and gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But probably the most serious consequence of this bill is where, on page 10, it describes that "a lessee shall not be eligible to obtain the economic benefit of any covered lease or any other lease."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the piece of the bill that The Washington Post declares to be heavy handed, the heavy-handed attack on the stability of contracts, a process that would be welcomed in Russia and Bolivia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez mandated that private oil firms cooperate with new contractual changes. Those firms that did not agree had their assets nationalized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This bill does not nationalize, but it prohibits firms who do not agree from participating in future contracts. It is a very serious contractual problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bolivia in 2006 threatened to expel oil companies that refused to agree to new government terms on already existing contracts. That is extraordinarily close to what we are doing in this bill. What Bolivia did has caused investors to begin to take their investments out of Bolivia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Russia, President Vladimir Putin wants to gain complete control, and so he has begun to renegotiate with companies like Shell, Exxon and BP, who have held valid oil leases in Russia for several years. Mr. Putin had a number of government agencies threaten to pull these leases for a number of suspect reasons. That is exactly the language contained in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not think it is the intent of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to be this heavy handed. This bill would have been presented differently if it had been sent to committee, if it had been debated in committee and if amendments had been allowed. My request is that we vote "no" on this bill and we send it back to the committee where we can get a good hearing to take the very troublesome parts of this bill, troublesome parts which The Washington Post describe as heavy handed and  the sort of thing that you would expect in Russia and Bolivia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this country, we want an environment that causes people to go out and invest. We want people to create jobs and to create a better standard of living. But this bill begins to undermine the full faith and credit of the United States by changing the contractual basis. I urge my colleagues to vote "no."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the portion of this bill under my committee's jurisdiction, the Ways and Means Committee, is somewhat complex; but the effect it would have is simple. These provisions raise taxes on our domestic energy industry. We should not mince words or use semantics; that is what those provisions do. They raise taxes on our home-grown domestic energy industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The result of that will be higher prices for gasoline, home heating oil, fewer manufacturing jobs and even more dependence on foreign oil. This legislation is in these respects the exact opposite of the energy policy that the United States needs. Anyone who is serious about energy security should oppose this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are two tax provisions in the legislation. The first deals with geological and geophysical expenses. These costs, referred to as G&amp;G expenses, are amortized over several years, just like other business expenses. The Democrats' bill would increase the amortization period for costs associated with efforts to find new domestic oil and gas from 5 years to 7 years for the largest American oil companies. That would raise their taxes by about $100 million over 11 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the far larger tax increase is a second provision, and this one is the one that is most unfair. It would eliminate the oil and gas industry, and only the oil and gas industry, from eligibility for the manufacturers' tax incentives, section 199 of the jobs bill. It increases taxes not just on Big Oil but on all oil and gas companies, big and small, that pay corporate taxes. That change will raise the industry's taxes by $7.6 billion over 11 years. This provision would not repeal any special  tax break for Big Oil. It won't repeal any subsidy for Big Oil. Instead, it would single out oil and gas businesses for higher taxes than all other manufacturing businesses in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Worse, it would not place any additional cost on foreign producers of oil and gas. In effect, the legislation would give a new competitive advantage to foreign oil producers and refiners. Why should Congress vote to help Hugo Chavez's regime in Venezuela at the expense of our own domestic energy industry?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The heart of the Democrats' argument seems to be that somehow energy is not an American manufacturing industry. That conclusion is absurd. The United States energy industry employs 1.8 million Americans. These are precisely the sort of high-paying manufacturing jobs that Democrats constantly complain America is losing. The average pay for those workers is $19.34 an hour for workers for oil and gas extraction, $28.41 an hour for refinery workers, and of course they get good benefits in addition  to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new Speaker of the House has said, "Manufacturing jobs are the engines that run the economy. These are  good jobs that give working families high standards of living." And I agree with her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new majority leader has said, "Jobs still will be the number one issue next fall, and manufacturing job loss overseas is a subset of that. We're hearing that giant sucking sound that Perot warned about."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, given that prominent Democrats claim to be concerned about the loss of American manufacturing jobs, why are they now leading an effort to drive these jobs overseas?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should also remember that these jobs are concentrated in the area of the country that was hardest hit by hurricanes Katrina and Rita. I know in my State of Louisiana, good-paying energy industry jobs are a key to our recovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, as we saw in the wake of those storms, our domestic refining is already strained to full capacity. The sticker shock many of us faced at the pump after the hurricanes hit was not as a result of a shortage of crude oil, but a shortage of refined gasoline. There are now plans to substantially boost our refining capacity to avoid a repeat of that situation. But repealing section 199 for American oil and gas companies could change that and leave the United States economy even more vulnerable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should also remember during this debate that oil companies are not some sort of evil rapacious organization. Indeed, higher taxes on oil companies affect nearly every American with a retirement or pension account because those accounts now hold about 41 percent of the shares in American oil and gas companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both of these new taxes would discourage new exploration for domestic energy resources and weaken our domestic energy industry, and the tax increases will be passed along to consumers. In addition, the effects will ripple throughout our economy, increasing the cost of nearly everything Americans buy and nearly every service they hire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increasing the cost of producing oil and gas in America, which this Democratic bill would do, will raise gasoline prices, ship manufacturing jobs overseas, and make America more dependent on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill certainly does not constitute a balanced energy policy for this country. What it does constitute is a purely political exercise that should be rejected by this House.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as I listened to my colleague from Louisiana, I would think that the end of the Western World as we have known it is about to descend upon us by these rather minor changes we are making in the tax policy of this country, by taking back subsidies to an oil industry that between January and September of 2006 has had $96 billion worth of profit reported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now these are minor changes at the most and we know that. This is a down payment on the changes that must go on in this country. We know the American people have spoken on this issue. They are demanding change. That is why they voted the way they did in November. They saw what they got out of the White House and out of the Vice President's office, the records of which are still kept secret so we don't know what agreements were made with the oil companies at the beginning of this administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spoke earlier, and after I spoke I went out of the Chamber and I bumped into some people from the National Wildlife Federation, and they gave me 30,000 signatures of people who want this bill to pass, people who care about the environment. People who care about global warming, people who believe in national security, who believe in economic security, signed this in the last 3 weeks. The American people obviously are way ahead of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Detroit didn't know what was going on. The Prius was on the street for 3 years in Tokyo, and they never saw it coming. When the Prius came to the United States, the waiting time was 18 months long. That is what we have to change. We have to change the thinking in this country about whether we are going to be addicted to oil forever or not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now global warming is real. The average temperature in the ocean has gone up 1 degree worldwide. In the Northwest, it is up more than 2 degrees. And the changes that means for salmon spawning and for the ecology that goes on are under way. Yesterday's New York Times had a story about the melting of the glaciers in Greenland. There is no question about whether global warming is happening. The question is whether this Congress will respond and lead the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Speaker Pelosi when she came in said she was going to do these things and set a new direction for this country. Today we are finishing up 100 hours of efforts in a whole series of areas, this being the toughest, this being the most complicated, the most costly, the one that is going to take us the most time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can change the health care system in fairly short order if we want to. We can change college loans in fairly short order if we want to. But changing the way we use energy in this country needs to start today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one says this bill is the be-all and end-all of what should happen, but we can see countries that have done it. In Brazil, they have gotten themselves off gasoline. They are using ethanol. We could do that. The Brazilians are not smarter than we are. They just decided as a country they were going to get off their addiction to oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Danes, when we dropped our support for the wind industry, picked up the technology and now at every place you go to see a windmill in this country, it is made in Denmark. Why is that? We started that in 1994 with some amendments supporting the wind industry, and then we let them expire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, 2005, we suddenly woke up and said, Oh my God, the Danes are ahead of us. We better start again. There is a whole series of things that we should be doing if we are serious about what is going to be our future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I have hoped that we would have a day like this when we would start to make the change. This is one small step. The Chinese say a journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step. This is the first step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Rahall has done an excellent job, and I want to congratulate the staff of the Ways and Means Committee, and particularly John Buckley whose idea this bill was. He came to me with the idea. It was not my idea. It was John Buckley's and congratulations to John.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400046" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the "Clean Energy Act of 2007." I agree with Democrats that we need to invest more in renewable energy, including new ways to fuel our cars. But by taxing American companies more for exploring and creating jobs here at home--and letting foreign oil companies off the hook--this bill says foreign oil and foreign jobs are good, American oil and American jobs are bad. That's just crazy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's bad energy policy--with big costs. Costs to the consumer at the pump, to the refinery worker in the Gulf, and to the retiree whose pension depends on the strength of American industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Don't be fooled--the special tax breaks they say the oil and gas industry gets aren't special at all. In 2004, at a time when manufacturing jobs were heading overseas by the thousands and we were increasingly worried about our foreign dependence on oil, Congress passed a bill that gave a tax incentive to all American manufacturers to get them to invest more here at home--including oil and gas producers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A year later, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act that the Democrats say provided huge tax breaks to "big oil." But they got that wrong, too. According to the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, this bill imposed a net tax increase of nearly $300 million over the next decade. At the same time, we provided incentives for energy exploration in difficult terrains so that our country could take another step toward weaning ourselves off foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we're seeing an important result from these policies: Jobs. The U.S. energy sector employs more than 1.8 million Americans, with good pay--up to $30 an hour on average, and often with union benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Texas, energy independence is our economy's life blood. Over 35,000 people work in the oil and gas sector in the Houston area alone, and nearly a quarter of our nation's crude oil is refined along the Texas Gulf Coast. Drilling is at record levels and reserves of natural gas are growing. Production is holding steady. The cost of oil, which is historically volatile, is down. And while Democrats like to take a swat at record oil and gas profits, these same companies are putting those profits  back  into infrastructure and technology--often more than twice their profits in a year. Margins are actually much lower.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the damage inflicted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to our exploration and refining capacity in the Gulf unmasked just how vulnerable our energy sector is. Plans are underway to strengthen that capacity--but that progress could be jeopardized if we place an undue tax burden on our refineries. In an area of the country that's still recovering from these disasters, why strip away even more jobs by taxing an industry that is helping supply thousands?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What's even crazier is that House Democrats will now consider American energy workers, including oil rig and refinery workers, as foreign workers for tax purposes--just so they can raise taxes on U.S. companies. Under this bill, farmers, software designers, and even cartoonists are considered manufacturing workers, but Americans who go to work each day to supply energy for this nation are classified as foreign workers. Explain that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats like to claim that we need this bill to lower gas and oil prices. I'm not sure who came up with that theory, but common sense tells me that if we put a strain on domestic manufacturers, that only serves to give a boost to foreign competition--and a boost to prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when some Americans are relying on Hugo Chavez to heat their homes this winter--we need to take a step back and clearly understand the consequences of our actions. Repealing these tax incentives would only serve to stifle domestic production of oil and gas, raise gas prices and home heating costs for Americans, send more jobs overseas, and increase our dependence on foreign sources of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new House leadership may believe it scores them cheap political points to target Texas energy companies, many of whom employ union workers, but our communities don't think it's so funny. And at a time we need more U.S. energy and less foreign oil, it makes no sense at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said before, I believe we should invest in the development of renewable energy and alternative fuels to protect our future and our children's future. But short-changing American jobs today isn't the way to do it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007. This bill takes an important first step towards a new energy future by investing in clean energy resources that will reduce harmful pollution and help break our addiction to foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> would reclaim $13 billion in tax breaks and giveaways that the Republican Congress extended to big oil in 2004 and 2005 and ensure that oil companies pay their fair share to drill on public land. It would use that revenue to create a Strategic Renewable Energy Reserve to invest in clean, renewable energy resources and alternative fuels, promote new energy technologies, develop greater efficiency and improve energy conservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last several years, Big Oil has raked in record profits while our dependence on foreign oil has climbed ever higher. At the same time, scientists have uncovered new and alarming facts about global warming that demand our urgent attention. While there is broad, bipartisan public support for investing in clean energy technology, the last Congress and the Administration seem to have been more concerned with taking care of their Big Oil buddies than steering us toward a sustainable energy  future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we have an opportunity to chart a new course. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> establishes a forward-thinking approach to energy that looks to American innovation to provide renewable energy for our future. Our security, our economy, and indeed, our very existence require nothing less.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it has been said several times but bears repeating. When you're in a hole, stop digging. Our dependence on oil--foreign and domestic--requires us to stop making the problem worse by giving oil companies billions upon billions of dollars in truly unnecessary subsidies that worsen our dependence. This bill redirects $14 billion away from these subsidies and toward more sustainable energy production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The transition to a renewable energy economy is not optional. The question is whether we will wait so long to create the transition that we do not make it on our own terms. Europe gets it. They are pouring orders of magnitude more money into research on renewables, positioning their industries to thrive in the future. On the other hand, this Administration has been digging its heels in by throwing billions of taxpayer dollars at an industry that made record profits on the backs of hard working  Americans. We have a long way to go to catch up and this bill steers us firmly in that direction. I urge my colleagues to vote "yes".</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400233" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Creating Long-Term Energy Alternatives for the Nation (CLEAN) Energy Act, H.R 6. This critical legislation is an important step in increasing our investment in the development of clean and efficient energy technology that will one day end our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The oil industry has been reaping record profits while working Americans have faced record high gas prices. Last year, while millions of Americans struggled to afford gasoline at $3 a gallon, the top five oil companies made nearly $97 billion in profit. The hard truth is that at a time of record energy costs and oil profits, families in Connecticut and across the country were getting tapped into twice: once at the pump and once again with their tax dollars going to oil companies in the form of  tax breaks and subsidies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today restores some common sense to our federal budget by repealing or minimizing nearly $13 billion in unnecessary tax subsidies given away to the oil and gas industries. It includes a rollback of a tax break for geological and geophysical exploration, a provision that the President himself suggested that Congress eliminate. In addition, it closes a $7.6 billion loophole written into the FSC/ETI international tax bill which allowed oil companies to qualify for a tax provision  intended to help domestic manufacturers struggling to sell their products overseas. Finally, the CLEAN Energy Act ensures that oil companies that were awarded the 1998 and 1999 leases for drilling pay their fair share in royalties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our dangerous dependence on foreign oil is much more than just an energy issue--it is at its very core a matter of national security, foreign policy, environmental responsibility, economic development and technological advancement. Our dependence on foreign energy has grown to an alarming 65 percent of our total need, and we send $800 million each day to the Middle East and other oil producing countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> takes the important step towards ending this dependence by directing receipts to a newly created Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve. This fund will be used to fund future legislation promoting energy efficiency and investing in renewable energy technologies, such as the hydrogen fuel cells developed in Connecticut, which will one day provide us with almost unlimited amounts of energy to run our cars, power our homes and businesses and move us away from a petroleum based  energy economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eliminating unneeded tax breaks for the oil industry and investing in new energy sources are just part of the solution to lowering energy prices for hardworking American families. As we move forward in the 110th Congress, we must also work to protect the American people from high energy costs by preventing the manipulation of the oil futures market and ending the practice of price gouging. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> is just the start and I look forward to working with my colleagues to address issues.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the CLEAN Energy Act. Protecting our environment and promoting energy independence are two of the most important jobs I have as a Member of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have long advocated repealing some of the tax breaks we give oil companies as "incentives" because our current market place provides adequate incentive as is to find additional sources of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also support using the $14 billion this bill will save in royalty relief to fund a renewable energy and efficient energy trust fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is we are not resolving our energy needs because we are not conserving. We'll just continue to consume more and waste more, consume more and waste more, and act like it doesn't matter. This legislation is a first step to begin to address our energy needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is similar to a provision in my energy legislation, the Energy for Our Future Act, which also repeals extraneous oil and gas company tax breaks. This is just one of the three principal goals the Energy For Our Future Act has for our national energy policy. I also hope Congress works to improve the fuel efficiency of passenger vehicles, provide incentives for the purchase of energy-efficient appliances and promote the growth of renewable energy, all three of which I deal with in my legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past we have taken steps to increase our supply with no focus on our need to conserve. I am pleased to see legislation that finally recognizes that we are on a demand course that is simply unsustainable if we do not take control of our over-consumption.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400124" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I'm proud to be a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation which commits nearly $14 billion to renewable energy technology and energy conservation and I rise in strong support of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we are eliminating unneeded subsidies and tax benefits for the largest and most profitable energy companies, and instead, investing the resources in the development and deployment of renewable energy resources and energy efficient technologies and practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This investment is critical because the status quo is not sustainable for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(1) The burning of fossil fuels is accelerating global climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) We have only 2 percent of the world's oil reserves yet we consume 25 percent of the world's annual oil production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(3) Two billion people on our planet today do not have access to electricity which is a basic necessity of life and economic security. They aspire to the prosperity we enjoy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(4) Without a change, we will face stiff competition for oil from the developing world. The Department of Energy estimates that China and India will spur a tripling of energy consumption among Asia's developing nations in the next 25 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than a series of problems, I see a tremendous opportunity for our nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Silicon Valley in my Congressional District, the entrepreneurs who developed personal computers, the Internet, e-commerce, biotechnology, and nanotechnology are now turning to energy as the next great frontier for innovation and growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the growing global demand for energy, they understand that the U.S. has the opportunity to be the primary exporter of clean energy and clean energy technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the first 9 months of 2006, these entrepreneurs helped fund $600 million of U.S. investment in green technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are investing in bio-fuels, bio-fuel infrastructure, and R&amp;D to make bio-fuel production more efficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One company in my district is developing a fuel cell system that will produce clean, onsite electricity for homes and offices while also providing transportation fuel for hydrogen vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Others are developing technology that will put fuel cells in laptop computers, consumer electronics and automobiles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are developing and manufacturing new, more productive solar cells and solar technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the largest computer, technology, and Internet firms are working to develop solutions to reduce the power used by large data centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my region, Tesla Motors, now the third-largest American-owned auto maker, has produced a new line of efficient electric sports cars, with more practical and affordable models on the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This isn't happening just in Silicon Valley. Wal-Mart is committing $500 million a year to become more energy efficient and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as it was important in the creation and commercialization of the Internet, Federal leadership is needed in this endeavor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the funding we're setting aside today, we're setting a national priority and providing the impetus for research, development, and deployment of new and emerging renewable energy technologies in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very positive step toward energy independence and I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400387" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Creating Long-Term Energy Alternatives for the Nation (CLEAN) Act. This bill eliminates $7.7 billion in unnecessary tax breaks for the oil and gas industry, and raises another $6.3 billion for the Federal Treasury from new royalties on oil and gas removed from Federal waters. This $14 billion is a good down payment on future energy policies that can help eliminate our oil addiction and stop global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is a good first step, but I will work with my colleagues to eliminate many of the other unnecessary tax subsidies for the oil and gas industry. Oil companies are enjoying record profits. Every time the price of gas increases, the value of existing tax subsidies increases and they make even more money. At a time of record gas prices and record profits we should not provide tax incentives for exploring, extracting or refining oil and gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The best ways to eliminate our dependence on oil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to lower demand and reduce emissions from power plants and vehicles. For example, fuel economy standards for passenger cars have not been raised since 1985, and even lower "light truck" standards encourage manufacturers to produce gas-guzzling SUVs. I support raising fuel economy standards to at least 33 miles per gallon, which would save 1.1 million barrels of oil a day by 2015 and 2.6 million barrels by  2025. Those who say that we can't do any better than 20-year-old technology might also like to trade their DVDs for VHS tapes, cell phones for pay phones, ipods for boomboxes, and then see just how advanced 1980s technology seems today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eliminating tax subsidies will increase revenues, but we must spend those revenues wisely in our quest for clean renewable energy sources. Incentives for clean coal, ethanol and nuclear are not the answer. We must focus our efforts on promoting advancements in wind, hydrogen, solar and thermal power. These renewable sources can provide significant energy output with minimal environmental impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> and urge all my colleagues to join me in voting for a cleaner America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, which will raise the prices at the pumps, discourage domestic energy production, hurt America's working families, and encourage America's dependence on foreign energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm reminded of the family down the road from me back home in Michigan. They are a family with four kids, both their parents work and are struggling to get by; and if this legislation becomes law every time they fill up their gas tank or heat their house it will be an even greater burden on this family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've always said my number one priority while I'm in Congress is to protect the American taxpayer, that's a promise I made and that's a promise that I'll keep. Never voting for a tax increase is the same promise I made and kept during my 16 years in the Michigan House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the first tax increase vote in 13 years and it didn't take the new majority more than 2 weeks to bring it to the floor to punish the American worker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation doesn't just force taxpayers to throw more money to the government, it also has our government tearing up already negotiated private contracts with the government at the same time we're trying to convince Russia, Venezuela and other countries to abide by the rule of law and respect its citizen's property rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bottom line, this bill will increase our reliance on foreign oil, decrease our competitiveness and raise the prices at the pumps and the energy bills of working families. I urge my colleagues to vote no on increasing our dependence on foreign oil and yes on lower taxes, less regulation and respect to the rule of law.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the CLEAN Energy Act. In the first 100 hours of this new Congress, the time finally has come to end the royalty rip-off, which has lined the pockets of Big Oil at the expense of the American taxpayers for entirely too long. For years, I have been working to ensure that Americans get what is owed to them from oil and gas companies through my work on the Government Reform Committee, scathing reports from the Government  Accountability Office, and offering amendments here on the House floor. I am thrilled that we finally have the opportunity to give this issue the full attention it deserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is indisputable that the American taxpayers are losing billions of dollars in royalties due to them by the oil and gas companies who are taking valuable resources out of Federal lands. The GAO estimates that because price thresholds were not included in deepwater leases from 1998 and 1999, the government has already lost up to $2 billion in royalties and could lose as much as $10 billion over the life of the leases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> addresses the problem by requiring current offshore fuel producers with royalty-free leases to either agree to pay royalties when fuel prices reach certain thresholds or agree to pay a new "conservation of resource fee." It would also close loopholes and end giveaways for Big Oil in the tax code and in the 2005 Energy Bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together these savings would generate $14 billion to create a Created Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. The majority of the American public support investing in alternative energy sources to end our addiction to oil, and even President Bush promised to invest in clean renewable fuels and cutting-edge technologies in his 2006 State of the Union Address. This clean energy fund will be used to pay for upcoming legislation to encourage people  to use clean domestic renewable energy resources already in existence, promote use of energy-efficient products and practices, and increase research and development of new cutting-edge technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we must take the opportunity to show the American people that we are with them, not with Big Oil. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> is an important first step towards a smart energy policy and a clean energy future, and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400238" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the legislation before the House, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time for Congress to face the facts and begin to break our nation's dangerous addiction to oil. The industry tax breaks and royalty holidays that we seek to eliminate today no doubt serve the interests of the big oil companies, but they do not serve the interests of our nation's long-term energy security, or, for that matter, the interests of taxpayers, consumers and the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We import more than 60 percent of the oil we consume every day in this country. We are increasingly dependent on oil imports from volatile regions of the world and from countries that are not necessarily our friends. If we do nothing, our dependence on imported oil will only grow. Some will say that the answer  is to provide more subsidies and tax breaks to encourage oil drilling in the United States. Well, we've tried that, and it hasn't worked. We're  more dependent on foreign oil than ever. All the industry subsidies in the world won't change the fact that the U.S. has just 3 percent of the global oil reserves. We can't drill our way out of this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than continue business as usual, today we are beginning to chart a new course to energy security. The legislation before the House repeals $13 billion in egregious tax subsidies and royalty holidays that have been given to the oil companies in recent years. Instead, we will invest these funds in clean, renewable energy that is made here in the United States, including solar, wind, biomass, and biofuels. We will also invest in new energy technologies and develop policies to stimulate investment  and deployment of energy efficient products and services. Investing in alternative fuels and new energy technologies is also an investment in jobs here in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make it clear that this legislation eliminates only the most egregious energy industry subsidies. First of all, we target the flawed deepwater oil and gas leases that were awarded in 1998 and 1999. Contrary to longstanding practice, these leases did not provide for royalty  payments--no matter how high oil prices rise. In this legislation, we require that these leases be renegotiated. The American people deserve a fair royalty for publicly-owned resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to respond to some of the statements made today by opponents of this legislation. Some have suggested that our legislation unfairly singles out the oil and gas industry by repealing their ability to take advantage of a tax provision intended to encourage domestic manufacturing. This is not the case. Many of my colleagues will recall that several years ago our trading partners in the European Union successfully challenged a tax benefit that the Federal Government provided to U.S. exporters.  Let's be clear that the oil and gas industry did not qualify for the old FSC-ETI tax benefit, and neither did any number of other U.S. industries, including financial services, hospitals, and real estate, to name only a few. When Congress repealed the FSC-ETI in 2004, we provided a replacement benefit to U.S. exporters in the form of tax benefit for domestic manufacturers. But for some reason, this manufacturing</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope this clears up this matter and that all my colleagues will join me in voting for this important legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today Democrats will bring forward the final piece of legislation in the Six for 06 for America, the Clean Energy Act of 2007. This bill is vital in assuring the American taxpayers that the government will close loopholes and end giveaways in the tax code for major oil companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my work as Ranking Member on the Government Reform Subcommittee on Energy and Resources in the 109th Congress, I worked closely with my colleague DARRELL ISSA in investigating the overlooked but serious problems with the oil and gas royalty programs. The mismanagement of several of these leases potentially could cost America's taxpayers nearly twenty billion in royalties over the next 25 years because of errors in drafting the leases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Had the leases been negotiated properly, it is estimated that the government would have collected an additional $700 million in royalties in 2005 alone. Do the math. These funds would allow one American family to fill their Dodge Caravan minivan over 12 million times, even with the high gas prices we are facing now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, our citizens should not pay for bureaucratic mistakes nor should they suffer the consequences of this administration not holding these companies accountable. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> will be a start to fixing this and many other examples of government mismanagement in the energy sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is time for us to promote energy legislation that will lead to positive outcomes for the economy and the environment while protecting taxpayers and consumers. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> does this and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412186" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>. Over the last 24 years, America's dependence on foreign oil has more than tripled. We currently import about 65 percent of our oil, a new record high. At the same time, the Federal Government has been providing tax incentives that have only exacerbated our oil dependence problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time that we pass this bill and repeal the subsidies created in the 2005 Energy Bill. These government giveaways could be much better used by investing in research and development of clean, renewable energy sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in my home State of New Jersey, we consume 11.1 million gallons of gasoline per day! That ranks 11th in the Nation. With such high consumption in New Jersey and across our country, we need to start thinking about the future and turn to alternative energy sources. Americans need more choices at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will not solve our energy dependence problems overnight, but we have to start somewhere. This legislation gives us a good starting point. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400090" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Clean Energy Act of 2007, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, like all of the bills brought to the floor by the Democratic leadership under the Six for '06 package has the same effect, to try to level the proverbial playing field so that every American family has a fighting chance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill takes a huge step in the right direction by repealing $14 billion in subsidies given to Big Oil companies and paid for by American taxpayers. It also addresses a future that we know is coming--a future where fossil fuels will be in far less plentiful supply--and sets the stage for investing those profits in clean, renewable and alternative energy technologies and sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill closes tax loopholes for oil companies, rolls back tax breaks for geological and geophysical expenditures and repeals five royalty relief provisions from the 2005 Republican energy bill. In fact, this bill will require companies that have been reaping billions in profits and providing record golden parachute packages to departing CEOs while the average American family has seen an overall decline in income, to pay royalties in order to qualify for new federal leases for drilling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The goal of this bill is energy independence for our country that will allow our foreign policy decisions to be based more on what's good for our citizens and not just what's good for our gas tanks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the Democratic leadership for bringing this legislation to the floor and I applaud this Congress for successfully passing six critical pieces of legislation that affect the everyday lives of all Americans.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400388" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, affordable and reliable energy is an important component of continued economic growth. It heats and cools our homes, facilitates the means of production, and fuels our transportation system. However, politics, not sound energy policy is driving the legislation before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tax provisions targeted for repeal in <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> are designed to encourage new capital investment in U.S. energy projects, and they are fulfilling this goal. Their repeal will discourage new domestic oil and gas production and refinery capacity, threaten American jobs, and make it less economic to produce domestic energy resources--thereby increasing our dependence on imported crude oil and refined fuel products. A recent economic analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers confirms:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Higher taxes on the U.S. activities of the oil and natural gas industry, as would result under <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, would be expected to reduce U.S. exploration, production, and refining activities and increase U.S. dependence on foreign oil. This outcome is in sharp contrast to long-term energy goals for a Nation less reliant on imported energy sources."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These results run directly counter to sound energy policy goals and, by diminishing energy supplies, would strike a blow to U.S. energy consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Provisions in the bill affecting the deep water royalty relief program will set back the significant gains in oil and gas production that are attributable to the program and discourage new domestic production. This program has been one of the most successful policy stimulants for U.S. oil and natural gas exploration and production. It has contributed to a nearly 400 percent increase in natural gas production and more than 100 new discoveries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The real impact of actions taken in this bill will be felt by our Nation's manufacturers and every day consumers of energy. The higher energy taxes will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher gasoline and home energy prices. Similarly, heavy users of oil and natural gas, such as manufacturers and their customers, will feel the pinch of these higher prices and the effects of higher gas prices will ripple throughout the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would give an unfair competitive advantage to foreign energy firms by placing tax increases squarely on the shoulders of domestic energy producers. This will encourage domestic energy companies, which employ 1.8 million Americans to move those jobs overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's energy future is too important to risk a rush to judgment, and <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> represents a significant step backward for our Nation's energy security. Imposing new costs, whether in the form of taxes or fees is contrary to the goal of providing stable and affordable energy supplies for American consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's energy consumers deserve a sound energy policy that will not hit them with unnecessarily increased energy costs. This legislation is a poor substitute for a real energy policy. I urge my colleagues to reject this punitive energy legislation and to decrease our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I stand in opposition to <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>. This bill is fatally flawed, both because of the provisions that it contains and also the process that brought it to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put: Congress performs best when the process of Authorization, Appropriation, and Oversight is followed through the regular order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill seeks to both Authorize and Appropriate at the same time by short-cutting the authority of the Budget Committee and directing spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, this new language was brought to the floor without the benefit of review by any Committees, and even before the Resources Committee has been organized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this bill seeks to create a slush fund for spending on non-specific programs with no enforcement mechanism to ensure that funds are spent appropriately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are not talking about an insignificant amount; rather, CBO estimates that these provisions will raise $14 billion dollars in federal revenue--$14 billion that should be returned to the Treasury for deficit reduction, if raised at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond the argument of oil and gas tax incentives, sanctity of contracts, or renewable resources, I simply cannot support a bill that displays such a disregard for the legislative process and handle taxpayer dollars with such irresponsibility.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400230" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, which will help our Nation take a major step toward energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must recognize that we cannot dig or drill our way out of our energy crisis and must move away from our reliance on oil and gas. Our nation deserves a comprehensive energy policy that guarantees access to affordable power, encourages energy conservation efforts, and pursues increased use of environmentally responsible and renewable sources of energy. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> moves us in exactly that direction. It will close expensive loopholes and end giveaways to oil and gas companies and invest those dollars  in clean and renewable sources of energy here in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have strongly supported efforts to develop and adopt new sources of energy, not only for the important environmental benefits they create, but also for their positive impact on our economy and national security. Just as our Nation worked together to put a man on the moon, we must now unite behind an energy policy that enhances national security, creates American jobs, and protects our environment. We must harness Americans' ingenuity and creativity to make the United States a world leader in  new energy technology and move our nation toward energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of my colleagues have talked for a long time about how we need to end our addiction to foreign sources of energy. Today we finally have an opportunity to follow through on our promises by voting for <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400218" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, which will begin to right our country's course on energy policy, steering us away from costly subsidies for the oil and gas industries that are both unnecessary and unwanted. Instead, this bill will allow our government to invest in its own industries, which produce clean, efficient energy that will improve our environment, produce jobs, and increase our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I cannot say why, during a time of record profits by oil and gas companies, this industry was targeted for tax relief in 2004 and 2005. I honestly cannot say why the majority of this congress thought it was a good idea to give away billions of taxpayer dollars in this way. What I do know, is that I am not alone in wondering why.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our own President, whose personal ties to the oil industry are well known, has said numerous times that industry does not need these subsidies. Just last year, he was quoted in the Washington Post saying:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Record oil prices and large cash flows also mean that Congress has got to understand that these energy companies don't need unnecessary tax breaks like the write-offs of certain geological and geophysical expenditures, or the use of taxpayers' money to subsidize energy companies' research into deep water drilling. I'm looking forward to Congress to take about $2 billion of these tax breaks out of the budget over a 10-year period of time. Cash flows are up. Taxpayers don't need to be paying for  certain of these expenses on behalf of the energy companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush was saying these things even before we passed the energy bill. In 2005 he said, "With oil at more than $50 a barrel, by the way, energy companies do not need taxpayer funded incentives to explore for oil and gas."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even the President, from the oil State of Texas, understands that our country needs to move in a new direction on energy policy. In his State of the Union address last year, he said, "America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world. The best way to break this addiction is through technology."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> will repeal the unnecessary giveaways to the energy industry by reducing the tax deductions for exploration that were included in the 2005 energy bill, and eliminating a tax break the industry never should have had. This is expected to raise $6.6 billion over 10 years, which will be set aside in a new strategic energy efficiency and renewables reserve to go toward research and development of newer, cleaner alternatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for us to invest in the midwest, not the Middle East. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400097" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the real issue here is about moving this Nation in the direction of energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's true that this bill is about increasing royalties for oil extracted from land owned by the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lease agreements from 1998 and 1999 mistakenly did not include the proper royalty language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, the American people lost out on an estimated $865 million in royalties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this legislation, Congress has an opportunity, and a responsibility, to correct this mistake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also have an opportunity to roll back unnecessary subsidies and tax breaks for oil companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the bill is not about sticking it to the oil industry as some critics have claimed. It is about creating an important funding mechanism for our Nation's energy future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout history, America has been an innovator in technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Benjamin Franklin's experiments with electricity paved the way toward harnessing its capabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Wright Brothers flew the first airplane.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America was the first to put a man on the moon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now is the time for America to become a leader in another field: renewable energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The funding generated from this bill will allow us to significantly increase our Nation's investment in renewable energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Nation, we have become more and more dependent on oil. We simply cannot maintain our current rate of oil consumption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let's not wait until we hit rock bottom before making significant progress toward energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it comes to renewable energy, we must go forward with the dedication and commitment that put America first in flight and put a man on the moon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's show the American people that this Congress will set this Nation on the path toward clean, renewable energy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, Creating Long-Term Energy Alternative for the Nation, also known as the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill closes up the tax loopholes that have enabled energy companies to reap huge profits in recent years, as the prices of oil and gas have risen exponentially.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also rolls back a 2005 Energy Bill tax break for geological and geophysical expenditures, and it repeals provisions that have enabled energy companies to duck out on paying taxes on these profits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One provision that especially appeals to me is the creation of a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Reserve will be used to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and it would accelerate the use of alternative fuel sources and renewable energy. In addition, it will encourage energy-efficiency and conservation of our resources. The provision will also ultimately fund research to produce better renewable energy technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House Science Committee, of which I am a member, has had hearings and markups on renewable energy research strategies, and it is clear that we should push harder toward renewable energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Energy research and development are the keys to lessening our dependence on foreign oil and to lessening our dependence on fossil fuels. The federal government should continue to support energy research and also provide incentives to encourage the American public and businesses to buy hybrid cars and support renewable fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must take the lead in supporting energy policies that are good for the environment and help reduce our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400176" topic="E.O. 12988 ">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased we're discussing the growing problem of America's dependence on foreign sources of oil and gas, and the high prices that consumers are paying here at home. In the 109th Congress we made great strides in promoting energy independence through tax incentives for oil and gas exploration, improvement of outdated infrastructure and added research into renewable resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But while the goal of "energy security" is a good one, I am concerned that today's bill moves us away from that objective. I frequently hear from constituents concerned about our growing dependence on foreign supplies. And rightly so--when we experienced the first "energy crisis," foreign countries provided one, third of our energy needs. Thirty years later, that reliance has nearly doubled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> does not address this problem. Quite the opposite: Through increasing taxes, the legislation makes it more costly for U.S. firms to develop domestic supplies. This means our over-dependence on foreign supplies will increase even more. The policies we have already put in place are working: American production of natural gas is up 407 percent, and deep water oil production is up 386 percent. And billions of dollars that would otherwise go to hostile nations have been invested in renewable  energy developed from open-loop biomass, geothermal and other resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, my constituents want a forward-thinking energy strategy that seeks new ways to meet our needs. Everyone agrees we should pursue "energy independence." <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> moves us farther from this goal.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR. MC CRERY">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the substance of this motion to recommit is basically to say, look, these matters are complex. My good friend on the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. McDermott, said that himself just a few minutes ago. And because of that complexity and because of the complexity of the issues, not only the tax issues in this legislation but the energy issues as well, this bill deserves regular order. It deserves to go through the relevant committees with full hearings,  full ability of both the majority and the minority to offer amendments in committee, and then have some sort of rule on the floor which allows for different opinions to be voted on as either amendments or substitutes as the process goes forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know by now, in this 100-hour exercise, which I think still has plenty of time left in it, frankly, we could even go back now and within the 100 hours have committee hearings and dispense with this bill in the regular order, and that is what this motion to recommit will do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It simply says this is not a rejection of the bill, it is not a rejection of the substance of the bill, it is merely saying let's take this important piece of legislation through regular order, let's allow Members of this House the full rights of Members to talk about a bill, hear expert witnesses, delve into the particulars of the legislation, offer amendments, try to make it better, and then, finally, bring it to the floor for a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The way that this bill has been rushed through, without regular process, without opportunity for amendment, or even a substitute, makes a mockery of the legislative process and certainly, I think, shortchanges the important subjects covered in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have talked about the tax consequences of the provisions in the bill which increase taxes on only one sector of American manufacturing, oil and gas. Again, it is not taking back a subsidy to oil and gas, it is not taking back a special tax break for oil and gas, it is singling out oil and gas for harsher treatment under the Tax Code than any other economic sector in this country. That is punishing oil and gas. That is punitive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that is not what this Congress should be engaged in, in my view. We should try to give a level playing field to all sectors of the American economy, give them all the same opportunities to succeed, to return value to its shareholders, to all those millions of pensioners that have pieces of shares of stock in these American oil and gas companies. They shouldn't be punished by this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should be striking a balance between the need for, as my good friend from Washington says, new alternative and renewable sources of energy for the future, but also recognize the immediate needs of this country and for the foreseeable future, the 20 or 30 years the experts say we are going to be reliant on fossil fuels. So we ought to have a balanced approach. We ought to encourage, not discourage exploration and development of fossil fuels in this country, and also encourage research and development  of new renewable sources of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the process that we have gone through on this bill didn't give us the opportunity to do that. This motion to recommit would give us that opportunity, and I urge its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in response to the declaration of the gentleman from Louisiana that this is a tax increase on the oil and gas industry, this bill is not a tax increase, I say to my colleagues. What we are doing is repealing subsidies, repealing royalties, and asking the oil and gas industry to pay their fair share. There is no tax increase whatsoever in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The meat and potatoes of this legislation, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, came through our Natural Resources Committee. It was drafted by our committee in consultation with the leadership. This committee is the same committee chaired in a previous Congress by our former colleague, Chairman Richard Pombo. Much of the legislation in this bill, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, has been debated, has had hearings held therein, and has even been voted upon by the House of Representatives in the previous Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would suggest to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to go back and look at those votes that were held in a previous Congress in order to be consistent today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, the new conservation fee of $9 per barrel that is set up in this bill if the companies choose to pay no royalties. That was set up in the Jindal-Pombo bill of the last session of Congress and supported by a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reference has been made to these notorious leases of 1998 and 1999, where the American taxpayers got socked the most; that these were instituted and allowed to take place under the Clinton administration. True, President Clinton was President of the United States at that time. But I would also remind my colleagues who make this charge that in 2000 we elected President George Bush as President of the United States, and the last time I looked at the calendar, this is 2007. Six years with no action  by the current Department of the Interior to correct these abuses. And, I might say, until December 31 of this year, Republicans controlled the Congress as well, yet no action was taken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we are doing here is an attempt to correct mistakes, correct bungling by the Department of the Interior, mismanagement, whatever word you want to call it, on these 1998-1999 leases where there were no royalties collected, where the price of oil has certainly gone above the threshold that was established in the 1995 Deep Royalty Relief Act, again passed by a Republican Congress, and which was overlooked in the implementation and collection on these 1998-1999 leases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To those who charge that we are breaching contracts today, there is ample precedent and reservation of power in the U.S. to impose fees for the conservation of resources both in the  statute in the Outer Continental Lands Act, and reserved specifically in the leases that are issued in the Gulf of Mexico. Again, these leases issued in 1998 and 1999 are royalty free regardless of market, and that is when we impose this conservation fee passed by the Republican  Congress in the past but failed to be enacted into law. So we have set ample precedent here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I conclude, let me say that I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, in a bipartisan fashion, as we have voted before on this legislation, to pass <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> for the sake of the American taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington, a member of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. McDermott.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge people to vote down this motion to recommit. Mr. McCrery sat in the other day when we had a forum in the Ways and Means Committee and we discussed this bill. We went over it fairly carefully with experts from two sources at least. And, clearly, we are making very modest changes. That was clear from the testimony we had, that these were modest changes to the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we make the bigger changes, which we will have to do to give us a real source of money for this, and decide how we are going to allocate it in the most effective way for the country, there will be full hearings in the Ways and Means Committee, and I look forward to having your participation. You have been a real wonderful change in the Ways and Means Committee for us, and we are looking forward to working with you on the Tax Code to make this truly the first step, the first teeny step, and  then we are going to make a lot of other big steps.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Point of order, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Missouri.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I do intend to request a recorded vote. However, I first want to make a point of order that the Chair just failed to properly announce the result of the question of passage by the requisite three-fifths pursuant to clause 5(b) of rule XXI, which requires a three-fifths vote to increase tax rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 102 of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> proposes to deny a deduction under section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for an income attributable to domestic production of oil, natural gas or primary products thereof.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code provides for up to a 9 percent deduction in the amount of corporate income that is taxable under section 11(b) of the Code.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As described in the joint statement of managers accompanying <bill type="h" number="4520">H.R. 4520</bill>, which created section 199, when enacted section 199 effectively created a lower percentage rate of tax and therefore reduced the amount of tax proposed by such section. Once fully phased in in 2010, section 199 reduces the tax rate under section 11(b) by 3 points.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 102 of the pending bill proposes to disallow this deduction for certain taxpayers, thus imposing a new, higher percentage of tax, and thereby increasing the amount of tax imposed on a taxpayer under section 11(b).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Joint Committee on Taxation has indicated that section 102 will increase tax receipts by $7.6 billion between 2007 and 2017.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, Madam Speaker, since this bill increases taxes, and since that tax burden will ultimately be passed on to every American consumer who owns or operates an automobile, I insist on my point of order and demand that <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> not be considered as passed unless agreed to by three-fifths of those Members present and voting.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> For what purpose does the gentleman from Washington rise?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, to hear the Speaker's answer to the question.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Does any other Member wish to be heard on this point of order?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask to be heard on the point of order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill should require a three-fifths majority for passage. Madam Speaker, it is important to point out that section 199(d)(6), the subject in this bill, incorporates by reference section 55 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 55 is specifically identified as a provision subject to the point of order found in clause 5(b) of House rule XXI. By amending section 199, the bill is increasing the applicable rate under section 55 as applied to oil and gas manufacturers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recognizing the connection between section 199 and section 55 is critical to the interpretation of House rule XXI. All of the sections identified in House rule XXI deal with the imposition of taxes, and those sections, in turn, are referenced throughout the Internal Revenue Code.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, Internal Revenue Code section 2(a)(1) defines the term "surviving spouse" for purposes of section 1 as a person whose spouse died up to 2 years before the current tax year. Amending section 2 of the Code to change the definition of a spouse to someone who died only 1 year ago would have the direct effect of increasing the tax rate on widows that is set by section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By way of further example, one computation method for farm income is found in section 1301 of the Internal Revenue Code. That section of the Code also explicitly references section 1. By changing the methods for computing farm income in section 1301, you can directly raise the tax rate of a farmer that is set by section 1.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, here comes the denouement. Madam Speaker, certainly the intent of rule XXI is for the House to clear a higher hurdle, a three-fifths majority, before it increases taxes on farmers or widows. That intent would be just as relevant in this case where a bill effectively raises the tax rate on some American manufacturers.</paragraph>
