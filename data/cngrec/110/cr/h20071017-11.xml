    <paragraph>I rise to call attention to a tragedy of our own making. In May of this year, a U.S. soldier, Alex Jimenez, along with several of his friends, were captured by al Qaeda. As our intelligence officers wanted to tap into wires to try to find his whereabouts, they were hobbled and had to wait 10 hours for lawyers to get through the FISA Court to allow them to get the critical information they needed. That information lost, this soldier and his compatriots have never been found, although  the bodies of one or two have been found.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats want to expand this FISA process now to our warfighting capabilities and hobble our soldiers to have to wait for hours and hours for lawyers to approve gathering information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back when I was in the State of Missouri, we had jokes between farmers and lawyers. They were kind of funny. But this is not a funny joke. How many lawyers does it take to rescue a hostage? The answer should be zero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the Democrats want to undermine our relationship with Turkey which will cripple our military's efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the Democrats want to pull our troops out of Iraq then have the courage to defund the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Otherwise, stop handicapping our military with bureaucratic red tape that will undermine their mission. The lives of our military personnel are on the line.</paragraph>
