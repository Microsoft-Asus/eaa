    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, another border agent has been tried for allegedly using too much force in arresting an illegal at the Texas-Mexico border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Former border agent David Sipe was found guilty in 2001 by a Federal court jury for using excessive force in arresting Jose Guevarra.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to news sources, the Federal prosecutor hid evidence at that trial that was beneficial to the border agent, such as the Federal Government had made deals and gave benefits to witnesses like Social Security cards, and the prosecutor had not revealed the criminal record of a witness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does this sound familiar to anyone? Anyway, Sipe was granted a new trial and last week a second jury, after hearing all of the facts and the truth, found the border agent not guilty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why does it seem our Federal Government is so zealous in prosecuting border agents who appear to be doing their job and give those who illegally enter the United States a free pass? Once again, it seems like the Federal Government is on the wrong side of the border war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
