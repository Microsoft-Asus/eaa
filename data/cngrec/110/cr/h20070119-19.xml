    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last year during the political campaign, House Democrats promised to pass six pieces of legislation if the American people trusted us with control of the House. The American people were looking for a new direction and turned to us to get them there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the first 3 weeks of the new Congress, we have not disappointed. Democrats have delivered on all six promises. During 100 hours we have increased the minimum wage, implemented the 9/11 Commission recommendations, cut student loan interest rates in half, repealed preposterous welfare handouts to Big Oil, approved Federal funding for promising stem cell research, and provided our government the ability to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for America's seniors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six major pieces of legislation passed by this House within the first 100 hours of the 110th Congress. And this legislation begins to move our Nation in a new direction, one where the needs of all Americans are finally addressed here on the House floor. These six pieces of legislation will produce real results for the American people, and that is why they garnered such strong bipartisan support over the last 3 weeks. And this is only the beginning.</paragraph>
