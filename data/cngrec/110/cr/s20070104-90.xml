    <paragraph>Today was a good day in the Senate. The spirit of bipartisanship is in the air. I look forward to working with the Republican leaders and Members of Congress as we move ahead and forward in this Congress, the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the information of Members, the first vote next week is Monday, January 8, at 12 noon. Therefore, Members should be prepared to be here and ready to vote. Time will show what we will do, but votes will be a lot quicker than they used to be. We will not wait around for long times. Most of the votes are not very close, and it is not fair to keep Members from their constituents and other work in their office. If some people are not here, they will not be recorded within a reasonable period of  time after the vote is called.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We hoped to proceed to <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>. We do not have consent to move forward on that yet, but we are confident we will.</paragraph>
