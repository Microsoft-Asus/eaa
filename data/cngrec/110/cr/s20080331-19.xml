    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in appreciation of the life and lasting legacy of civil rights activist and labor leader, C&#xE9;sar Ch&#xE1;vez.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>C&#xE9;sar Ch&#xE1;vez came from humble beginnings, born on March 31, 1927, in a small farm outside of Yuma, AZ. Through his experiences as a laborer and migrant worker in the fields of the southwest United States, he recognized a need for change; change that would bring social and economic equality to those who tilled America's soil and harvested America's crops. The exploitation and discrimination experienced and observed by Mr. Ch&#xE1;vez energized his courageous fight for fair and equal  treatment for his hardworking colleagues of all backgrounds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the U.S. Navy he served in the western Pacific during the end of World War II to protect the freedoms that he often did not enjoy. He demonstrated his dedication to two great values--community and compassion--by building a powerful coalition of grass roots organizations and inspiring individuals of all backgrounds to join a campaign for social equality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>C&#xE9;sar Ch&#xE1;vez is not only an icon for Mexican-American communities across this great country, but also an American icon for all those who have felt the pain of injustice and for those who recognize the continuing need to allow equal access to the resources of our great Nation. His tireless efforts to help bring our country closer to its ideals of freedom and equality of opportunity shall be recognized today as they were when he posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  His legacy inspires hope, action, and prosperity for those who are often burdened by marginalization and discrimination. Our society owes gratitude to the indelible mark that Mr. Ch&#xE1;vez has left on our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the Clark County Commission for commemorating the legacy of a giant in our Nation's labor movement by declaring March 31, 2008, as C&#xE9;sar Ch&#xE1;vez Day. I join the Commission, and many throughout Nevada, in honoring Mr. Ch&#xE1;vez's visionary leadership. We must continue to recognize the value in C&#xE9;sar Ch&#xE1;vez's legacy, which has become a symbol of dignity and perseverance for all workers, whether in the fields, in the factories, or behind the counter.</paragraph>
