    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to my good friend, the majority leader, I share his view that we ought to wrap up this legislation this week. We intend to cooperate toward that end. There are some additional amendments over here on which we would hope we could get votes. But I, too, share the view that this legislation should be completed later this week. I will be talking with the majority leader about how to move toward that end.</paragraph>
