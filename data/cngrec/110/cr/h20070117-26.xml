    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this College Student Relief Act of 2007. This bill will help thousands of students throughout the State of Maine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maine has one of the highest high school graduation rates in the country. However, only one out of four Mainers go on to complete college. That is because college costs are rising, and  many Maine students cannot afford their tuition. Too many are being denied the opportunity that college provides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us today would save students thousands of dollars on their loan repayment by cutting interest rates in half. Students in Maine beginning college in the fall of 2007 would save $2,107 on their loans, and those starting in 2011 would save $4,210.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is also consistent with the pay-as-you-go principle that my fellow Blue Dogs and I have long advocated and that the Speaker has committed to. So it will not increase the deficit one dime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation to help all the young people live the American Dream.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
