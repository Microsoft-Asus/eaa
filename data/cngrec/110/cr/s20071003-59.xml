  <narrative>ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, -- (Senate - October 03, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12693">S12693</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="OCTOBER 4, 2007">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 9 a.m. tomorrow, October 4; that on Thursday, following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders reserved for their use later in the day, and there then be a period of morning business for 60 minutes, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, with the  time equally divided and controlled between the Democrats and the Republicans, with the Republicans controlling the first half; that at the close of morning business, the Senate then proceed to the consideration of <bill type="h" number="3093">H.R. 3093</bill>, the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would also say to all the Members, we are going to do our best to finish this bill tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to give it the old college try. I think we should be able to do it. It is an important bill. We are going to do our very best to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also say that the next appropriations bill we are going to move to is the Labor-HHS bill, which is extremely important. Again, I have had conversations the last several days with the Republican leader, and we are now moving through the process. The bill to go to conference has not been held up by the Republicans. The Democrats have held themselves up. We have not been able to get the 302(b) allocations and the other things we needed to work out to be able to do that. Now we are in the  process of being able to do that as of yesterday, so we expect to move very expeditiously on these bills so that we can get a bill or bills to the President as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My goal is to finish what we need to do here by November 16. It is easy to say that and it is hard to do, but that certainly is my timetable.</paragraph>
  </speaking>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me just add that I couldn't agree more with what the majority leader has just indicated his goals are, and he will have great cooperation on this side of the aisle to achieve the goal of finishing these bills and wrapping up our business.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
