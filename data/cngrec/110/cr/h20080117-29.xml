  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, yesterday we revisited the question of the Defense Authorization bill. I think it is important to remind my colleagues that in our appropriations bill that was passed and signed by the President, we took care of a number of issues dealing with our soldiers, including an increase in their compensation, including a recognition of traumatic brain injury, and a number of other concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill yesterday was a disappointment because it continued to include money for Iraq, and it is time to bring our soldiers home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to commend the debate today on HOPE VI, another issue that addresses the issue of homelessness and those who are without homes. This legislation was provocative and important because it is an economic stimulus when you provide housing for those in public housing who cannot be housed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is innovative because it suggests we should have green buildings, meaning more efficient, and it is innovative because it protects the elderly who may have those young people in their homes who have had some run-in with the law, that those individuals go but not the elderly who would be evicted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good piece of legislation. I supported HOPE VI. I am disappointed I could not support the Defense Authorization bill.</paragraph>
