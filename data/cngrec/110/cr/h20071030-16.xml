  <speaking speaker="412217" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of a permanent research and development tax credit. We are the strongest Nation on Earth, in large part because of the innovation inspired through research and development. This has been a driving force through our history, leading us to discoveries which add convenience, comfort and productivity to our lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Nebraska, now more than ever, our rural businesses grow when people are willing to face the uncertainty and risks which others find daunting. In our increasingly competitive global economy, it is essential we ensure there is a permanent, meaningful incentive for all businesses to invest in research and development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We live in a world with limitless innovation, and I look forward to seeing what the future will bring from further research and development.</paragraph>
