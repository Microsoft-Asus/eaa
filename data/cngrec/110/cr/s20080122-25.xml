  <narrative>The legislative clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>A bill (<bill type="h" number="4986">H.R. 4986</bill>) to provide for the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008, and for other purposes.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I oppose the fiscal year 2008 Defense authorization bill because it authorizes $189.5 billion for the war in Iraq but does nothing to end the President's misguided, open-ended Iraq policy. That policy has overburdened our military, weakened our national security, diminished our international credibility, and cost the lives of thousands of brave American soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are certain provisions of the bill that I support strongly, including a pay raise for military personnel, Senator Webb's amendment creating a Commission on Wartime Contracting to examine waste, fraud, and abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Senator Lautenberg's amendment to create a Special Investigator General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But on balance, I cannot vote to support a bill that defies the will of so many Wisconsinites--and so many Americans--by allowing the President to continue one of the worst foreign policy mistakes in the history of our Nation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to applaud the chairman and ranking members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senators LEVIN and MCCAIN, respectively, on passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, I would like to express my gratitude to the bill conferees for their inclusion of four amendments that I authored and which were unanimously adopted by the Senate during its initial consideration of this bill. These provisions will increase oversight of our country's economic and security assistance to Afghanistan by creating a Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, section 1229; help victims of state sponsored terrorism to achieve justice through the U.S. courts,  section 1083; prevent military health care fees through the TRICARE program from rising, sections 701 and 702; and increase accountability and planning for safety and security at the Warren Grove Gunnery Range in New Jersey, section 359.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I was proud to be joined by my cosponsors, Senators COBURN, DODD, HAGEL, FEINGOLD, WEBB, and MCCASKILL, in creating a Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. I wrote this legislation because I believe that while a democratic, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan is important to the national security of the United States and to combating international terrorism, I am concerned that we are not achieving all of our goals there. The United States has provided  Afghanistan with over $20 billion in reconstruction and security assistance. However, repeated and documented incidents of waste, fraud, and abuse in the utilization of these funds have undermined reconstruction efforts. I therefore believe that there is a critical need for vigorous oversight of spending by the United States on reconstruction programs and projects in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to emphasize that the Government Accountability Office and the departmental Inspectors general have provided valuable information on these activities. However, I believe that the congressional oversight process requires more timely oversight and reporting of reconstruction activities in Afghanistan. Oversight by this new Special Inspector General would encompass the activities of the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the U.S. Agency for International Development,  as well as other relevant agencies. It would highlight specific acts of waste, fraud, and abuse, as well as other managerial failures in our assistance programs that need to be addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new position will monitor U.S. assistance to Afghanistan in the civilian and security sectors, as well as in the counternarcotics arena, and will help both Congress and the American people better understand the challenges facing U.S. programs and projects in that country. I am pleased that this provision has been included in this final bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, this bill includes my legislation to provide justice for victims of state-sponsored terrorism, which has strong bipartisan support. I believe this legislation is essential to providing justice to those who have suffered at the hands of terrorists and is an important tool designed to deter future state-sponsored terrorism. The existing law passed by Congress in 1996 has been weakened by recent judicial decisions. This legislation fixes these problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1996, Congress created the "state sponsored terrorism exception" to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, FSIA. This exception allows victims of terrorism to sue those nations designated as state sponsors of terrorism by the Department of State for terrorist acts they commit or for which they provide material support. Congress subsequently passed the Flatow Amendment to the FSIA, which allows victims of terrorism to seek meaningful damages, such as punitive damages, from state sponsors of  terrorism for the horrific acts of terrorist murder and injury committed or supported by them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress's original intent behind the 1996 legislation has been muddied by  numerous court decisions. For example, the courts decided in Cicippio-Puleo v. Islamic Republic of Iran that there is no private right of action against foreign governments--as opposed to individuals--under the Flatow Amendment. Since this decision, judges have been prevented from applying a uniform damages standard to all victims in a single case because a victim's right to pursue  an action against a foreign government depends upon State law. My provision in this bill fixes this problem by reaffirming the private right of action under the Flatow Amendment against the foreign state sponsors of terrorism themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My provision in this bill also addresses a part of the law which until now has granted foreign states an unusual procedural advantage. As a general rule, interim court orders cannot be appealed until the court has reached a final disposition on the case as a whole. However, foreign states have abused a narrow exception to this bar on interim appeals--the collateral order doctrine--to delay justice for, and the resolution of, victim's suits. In Beecham v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,  Libya has delayed the claims of dead and injured U.S. service personnel who were off duty when attacked by Libyan agents at the Labelle Discothe 2que in Berlin in 1986. These delays have lasted for many years, as the Libyans have taken or threatened to take frivolous collateral order</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another purpose of my provision is to facilitate victims' collection of their damages from state sponsors of terrorism. The misapplication of the "Bancec doctrine," named for the Supreme Court's decision in First National City Bank v. Banco Para El Comercio Exterior de Cuba, has in the past erroneously protected the assets of terrorist states from attachment or collection. For example, in Flatow v. Bank Saderat Iran, the Flatow family attempted to attach an asset owned by Iran through the Bank  Saderat Iran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Iran owned the Bank Saderat Iran, the court, relying on the State Department's application of the Bancec doctrine, held that the Flatows could not attach the asset because they could not show that Iran exercised day-to-day managerial control over Bank Saderat Iran. My provision will remedy this issue by allowing attachment of the assets of a state sponsor of terrorism to be made upon the satisfaction of a "simple ownership" test.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another problem is that courts have mistakenly interpreted the statute of limitations provision that Congress created in 1996. In cases such as Vine v. Republic of Iraq and later Buonocore v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the court interpreted the statute to begin to run at the time of the attack, contrary to our intent. It was our intent to provide a 10-year period from the date of enactment of the legislation for all acts that had occurred at anytime prior to its passage in 1996.  We also intended to provide a period of 10 years from the time of any attack which might occur after 1996. My provision clarifies this intent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My provision also addresses the problems that arose from overly mechanistic interpretations of the 1996 legislation. For example, in several cases, such as Certain Underwriters v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, courts have prevented victims from pursuing claims for collateral property damage sustained in terrorist attacks directed against U.S. citizens. My new provision fixes this problem by creating an explicit cause of action for these kinds of property owners, or their insurers,  against state sponsors of terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, in several cases the courts have prevented non-U.S. nationals who work for the U.S. Government and were injured in a terrorist attack during their official duties from pursuing claims for their personal injuries. My provision fixes this inequity by creating an explicit cause of action for non-U.S. nationals who were either working as an employee of the U.S. Government or working pursuant to a U.S. Government contract.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to make special mention of the inspiration for this new legislation. On October 23, 1983, the Battalion Landing Team headquarters building in the Marine Amphibious Unit compound at the Beirut International Airport was destroyed by a terrorist bomb killing 241 marines, sailors, and soldiers who were present in Lebanon on a peace-keeping mission. In a case known as Peterson v. the Islamic Republic of Iran, filed on behalf of many of the marine victims and their families, the U.S. District  Court ruled in 2003 that the terrorist organization Hezbollah was funded by, directed by, and relied upon the Islamic Republic of Iran and its Ministry of Information and Security to carry out that heinous attack. The judge presiding over this case, Judge Royce Lamberth, referred to this as "the most deadly state sponsored terrorist attack made against United States citizens before September</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, President Bush's veto of the initial version of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008, <bill type="h" number="1585">H.R. 1585</bill>, on New Year's Eve required that my provision to provide justice for victims of state-sponsored terrorism be amended. The President chose to take this extraordinary action without warning after asserting that he had not been aware of the provision's potential impact on the Government of Iraq. The President contended that this provision would hinder Iraqi reconstruction  by exposing the current Iraqi government to liability for terrorist acts committed by Saddam Hussein's government and vetoed the entire Defense Authorization bill on that basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To address the President's concerns that the Government of Iraq could be made liable, the revised provision grants the President the authority to waive the terror victim's provision only for cases in which Iraq or its agencies, instrumentalities, or governmental actors are named defendants. The provision does not give the President the authority to waive any part of the provision for any case in which a government, its agencies, instrumentalities, or governmental actors are named defendants other  than Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By insisting on being given the power to waive application of this new law to Iraq, the President seeks to prevent victims of past Iraqi terrorism--for acts committed by Saddam Hussein--from achieving the same justice as victims of other countries. Fortunately, the President will not have authority to waive the provision's application to terrorist acts committed by Iran and Libya, among others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, my new provision includes a Sense of the Congress that the Secretary of State should work with Iraq, on a state-to-state basis, to resolve the meritorious claims made against Iraq by terror victims. It is crucial that the victims of these terrorist acts be included in such discussions. Their approval of agreements made between the two governments on their behalf is critical to ensuring that justice is served.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, this Defense authorization bill includes my provision to prevent proposed increases in enrollment fees, premiums, and pharmacy copayments for TRICARE, the military community's health plan. The principal coauthor of this provision is Senator Hagel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both career members of the uniformed services and their families endure unique and extraordinary demands and make extraordinary sacrifices over the course of 20-year to 30-year careers in protecting freedom for all Americans. I believe they deserve the best retirement benefits that a grateful nation can provide. Proposals to compare cash fees paid by retired military members and their families to fees paid by civilians fails to adequately recognize the sacrifice of military members. We must be  mindful that military members prepay the equivalent of very large advance premiums for health care in retirement through their extended service and sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Defense and our Nation have a committed obligation to  provide health care benefits to Active Duty, National Guard, Reserve, and retired members of the uniformed services, their families, and survivors, that considerably exceed the obligation of corporate employers to provide health care benefits to their employees. Ultimately, the Department of Defense has options to constrain the growth of health care spending in ways that do not disadvantage  current and retired members of the uniformed services, and it should pursue any and all such options as a first priority. Raising fees excessively on TRICARE beneficiaries is not the way to achieve this objective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I thank the conferees for including my amendment to require increased oversight and accountability, as well as improved safety measures, at the Warren Grove Gunnery Range in New Jersey. I wrote this provision with Senator Menendez because a number of dangerous safety incidents caused by the Air National Guard have repeatedly impacted the residents living nearby the range.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 15, 2007, a fire ignited during an Air National Guard practice mission at Warren Grove Gunnery Range, scorching 17,250 acres of New Jersey's Pinelands, destroying 5 houses, significantly damaging 13 others, and temporarily displacing approximately 6,000 people from their homes in sections of Ocean and Burlington Counties in New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My provision will require that an annual report on safety measures taken at the range be produced by the Secretary of the Air Force. The first report will be due no later than March 1, 2008, and two more will be due annually thereafter. My provision will also require that a master plan for the range be drafted that includes measures to mitigate encroachment issues surrounding the range, taking into consideration military mission requirements, land use plans, the surrounding community, the economy  of the region, and the protection of the environment and public health, safety, and welfare. I believe that these studies will provide the type of information that we need to ensure that there is long-term safety at the range, both for the military and the surrounding communities.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have sought recognition to address the pay raise given to members of the U.S. military. On December 28, 2007, President Bush vetoed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 because of a disagreement over a provision in the Justice for Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The disagreement over language in the Justice for Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Act has affected far more individuals than the legislation itself addresses. By holding up the signing of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, it jeopardized the pay raise which was promised to our Nation's servicemen and servicewomen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 4, 2008, the President issued Executive Order 13454, which gave all members of the military a 3-percent pay raise effective January 1, 2008. I commend the House for its January 16, 2008, decision to make retroactive to January 1, 2008, a 3.5-percent pay raise for members of the uniformed services. This was the number that the House and the Senate agreed upon before we sent the bill to President Bush in December; I think it is only fair this be the number we return to when we again  submit the bill to the President. The men and women of the military should not be made to suffer for disagreements between the Congress and the White House.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in a few minutes, I am going to ask unanimous consent to take up the authorization bill for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2008. But before we proceed to consider and pass this important legislation, I want to take just a moment to advise my colleagues of the unfortunate and troubling path that this legislation has taken since the Senate last voted to pass it on December 14.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 19, the same day the other body adjourned its first session, the Congress sent to the President legislation, <bill type="h" number="1585">H.R. 1585</bill>, that was identical to the bill we are about to take up and pass, with one substantive difference regarding section 1083 and several associated technical corrections necessary due to the delay of the bill's enactment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I want to focus on today is the manner in which the President chose to exercise his veto prerogative. As the Chair and our colleagues are well aware, the Framers of our Constitution deliberately gave the President only a limited or qualified veto power, one that could be overridden by Congress if it could muster a two-third vote in both Houses--a formidable challenge. But President Bush was not satisfied simply to veto the bill and risk an override, as contemplated under our constitutional  process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather, on December 28, the President issued a memorandum of disapproval stating that, because the other body had adjourned its first session, while the Senate remained in session to protect its advise-and-consent prerogative, he considered the bill pocket vetoed, relying upon the constitutional provision that protects against the Congress's adjourning in order to prevent the President from exercising his veto power. But the President did not actually pocket the bill. Instead, using the mechanism  provided in the rules of the other body for such periods as the December holidays, the White House returned the bill, with the President's veto message, to the Clerk of the House, for transmission to the full body when it reconvened last week. The President said that he was returning the bill "to avoid unnecessary litigation" and "to leave no doubt" that he was vetoing the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Constitution does not provide for double vetoes: A bill is vetoed either by being returned or, if return is prevented by Congress's adjournment, by being pocketed. Here, the President returned the bill to the other body through delivery to the Clerk. Obviously, the adjournment did not prevent the bill's return. Accordingly, the bill was not subject to a pocket veto. Had the President not returned the bill within the 10 days--excluding Sunday--prescribed by the Constitution, the bill would  have become law without his signature. That fact explains why the President returned the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, in 1983, President Reagan attempted to pocket veto a military aid appropriations measure during an analogous adjournment--the break between the first and second sessions of the 98th Congress. On a bipartisan basis, the Senate  joined a group of Members of the other body to challenge that attempted misuse of the pocket veto in a Federal court case called Barnes v. Kline. Although the decision was subsequently vacated because the fiscal year for the military aid bill had expired in the meantime, thereby mooting the case, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the Executive's attempt to pocket veto the bill and held that, because it could have been returned to the House, under the Constitution  the bill had become law. The court held that three factors, when taken together, establish that adjournment of the first session of a Congress does not prevent the President from returning a bill under the Constitution: First, "[t]he existence of an authorized receiver of veto messages"; second, "the rules providing for carryover of unfinished business" in the second session of a Congress; and third, "the duration of modern intersession adjournments."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that decision, the court of appeals built upon the foundation laid by our colleague, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, who, a decade earlier personally had argued and won the case Kennedy v. Sampson in the same court, thereby establishing the President's duty to return bills to Congress, through its appointed officers, during intrasession adjournments. As the court made clear, during both types of adjournments, the application of the pocket veto clause has necessarily been guided from  the beginning by its "manifest purpose." And that purpose is solely to ensure that the Congress cannot deprive the President of his right to exercise the qualified veto, not to permit the President to accomplish what the Framers of our Constitution denied him--by transforming the qualified veto into an absolute veto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have gone into some detail in explicating the background and history of the pocket veto controversy because of its importance to our constitutional system of separation of powers and checks and balances between the branches. The President should abandon the strange and unseemly practice  of maintaining that he cannot return a bill to Congress, while simultaneously returning the bill. Such game-playing is unworthy of the Office of the President and breaks  faith with the brilliant, carefully crafted system that the Founders bequeathed to us and future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, much as part of me would like to see Congress take the opportunity provided by the President's action here to establish definitively the Congress's constitutional power to override a veto exercised during its adjournment, the Nation's security and the care of our troops and wounded warriors demands that we get this bill signed into law as soon as possible. This bill provides important congressional authorizations and guidance for the Nation's defense budget, a 3.5-percent 9 pay raise  and key bonuses for the troops, legislation to improve the system of care for our wounded warriors, and authorization to establish a war profiteering commission. The President's veto of this bill in December has already delayed these provisions for too long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to reiterate that it is my belief that the Government of Iraq should take responsibility for what has taken place there in years past, including the brutal torture of American POWs. Congress has gone on record repeatedly--most recently, in overwhelmingly passing section 1083 of the conference report to <bill type="h" number="1585">H.R. 1585</bill> last year in both the House and Senate and sending it to the President--to support the efforts of these Americans who have suffered so much for their country to hold their  torturers accountable. This administration has been fighting for years to oppose efforts to win compensation for these American soldiers, which is, frankly, a disgrace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In light of the President's veto over this issue, I call on him and his administration to work with the POWs and their family members to facilitate negotiations with the Government of Iraq. It is my understanding that the administration has been working with Iraq to settle gulf war commercial debts with foreign corporations such as Mitsubishi of Japan and Hyundai of Korea through issuance of Iraqi bonds. This mechanism takes no funds from the reconstruction of Iraq. It is beyond me why the administration  would refuse to do at least that for the POWs. The administration needs to make this right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill (<bill type="h" number="4986">H.R. 4986</bill>) was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.</paragraph>
