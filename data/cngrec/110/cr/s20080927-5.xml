  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - September 27, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9881">S9881</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, following the remarks of the leaders, if any, the Senate will proceed to the consideration of the House message to accompany <bill type="h" number="2638">H.R. 2638</bill>, the continuing resolution. The time until 10 a.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the leaders or their designees. At exactly 10 a.m., the Senate will proceed to a rollcall vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to <bill type="h" number="2638">H.R. 2638</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As those of us here have seen, in trying to make entry to the Capitol, there is something of a bicycle race or performance of some kind. It has really slowed things up, so we are not going to terminate the vote in the normal 15-minute time schedule. We are going to make sure people have an opportunity to get here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to all Members, unless something can be resolved by consent, we are going to file cloture today on the Department of Defense authorization bill, which will be a Monday vote. Hopefully, there does not have to be a vote tomorrow. Thirty hours after cloture was invoked on this matter will be sometime tomorrow afternoon. There are a number of ways we can do that. People wanting the extra 30 hours could waive that or they could let us have a voice vote tomorrow. As I understand it, there is  only one Senator holding up this bill now. We will work on that during the next hour or so. It appears we may have to be in session tomorrow, with a vote on Monday. I know there is a holiday on Monday starting at sundown and going to sundown on Tuesday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The staff worked until about 3 a.m. this morning on the bailout. They made significant progress. There are probably 15 issues still left outstanding. Senators are going to have to get together and resolve those. We hope sometime tomorrow evening we can announce that there has been some kind of an agreement in principle so the only thing that will have to be done is to write the legislation. We are still a long way from completing it, but we have made significant progress, as I just indicated.  We will keep Senators advised on a timely basis as well as we can.</paragraph>
