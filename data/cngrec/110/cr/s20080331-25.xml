    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor a visionary in the field of music education, Dr. Walter Pavasaris. Dr. Pavasaris, a native of New Britain, CT, has been selected to receive the Massachusetts Music Educators Distinguished Service Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Walter M. Pavasaris has been a music educator and curriculum coordinator in Massachusetts for the past 31 years. During that time he has taught all levels of K-12 music, including both general and instrumental, as well as teaching undergraduate and graduate level courses in various collegiate settings. In Walter's position as coordinator of fine and performing arts for the Lexington Public Schools, he is responsible for the implementation of the K-12 curriculum in the areas of music, visual arts,  and drama. He leads a faculty of 41 highly motivated professional artists/educators. In addition to his responsibilities in Lexington, Walter also serves on the music education faculty at the Boston Conservatory of Music.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1971, Walter graduated from the University of Hartford, Hartt College of Music, with a bachelor of music education degree. While at Hartt he studied double bass with Bert Turetzky, Leland Tolo, and also traveled to Boston and Tanglewood to study with William Rhein, associate principal double bassist of the Boston Symphony. While completing his undergraduate degree at Hartt, Walter was active as a freelance musician playing in a variety of small combos and big bands in the greater Hartford,  CT, area. Additionally, he played in the Smith College Orchestra, Springfield, MA, Symphony and New Britain, CT, Symphony. In his senior year Walter was recognized by Hartt College of Music as an Outstanding Music Educator based on his outstanding leadership, participation, and scholarship in the field of music.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following his graduation from Hartt College of Music, Walter won an audition and was selected to become a member of the U.S. Military Academy Band at West Point, NY. During the next 3 years he played sousaphone in the marching band and double bass in the concert band and chamber orchestra. While at West Point, Walter was a member of the Hudson Valley Philharmonic Orchestra. During this time, he studied with New York Philharmonic double bassist Orin O'Brien.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon his discharge from the Army, Walter began his graduate studies at the University of Michigan majoring in stringed instruments. While at Michigan, he was a teaching fellow in the String Department. He studied double bass with Larry Hurst. During his years at Michigan, Walter played in a variety of orchestral ensembles and was the double bassist in the wind ensemble conducted by H. Robert Reynolds. He earned his master of music in string instruments in December 1976.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In September of 1977, Dr. Pavasaris joined the music faculty of the Belmont, MA, public schools. During his first few years in Belmont, his teaching responsibilities included being the director of orchestras and string teacher for grades 3 to 12, and conducting one of the middle school bands. As string enrollments flourished, his responsibilities shifted to overseeing the entire string and orchestral curriculum in grades 3 to 12. In addition to teaching large heterogeneous grouped weekly string  lessons in each of the elementary schools, Walter encouraged his students to also be part of the very popular "Saturday Morning" music program, which he administered during many of the years he was in Belmont. It was in this program that all elementary students, studying an instrument, received a small homogenously grouped lesson as well as the opportunity to participate in either the All-Town String Orchestra or Band.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his years in Belmont, the Belmont High School and Chenery Middle School Orchestras expanded their music making both within and outside the community. Under his baton, the middle and high school orchestra ensembles consistently earned superior ratings at numerous State, regional, and international music festivals. Additionally, the Belmont High School Orchestra was selected to perform at the All-Eastern MENC Conference in Boston in 1983.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1990, Walter was appointed coordinator of fine and performing arts for the Lexington Public Schools. His primary responsibilities include advocating for the arts and creating and implementing curricula in the areas of music, visual arts, and drama. Along with advocating for the arts among a wide array of constituencies, he also supervises and evaluates the K-12 fine and performing arts faculty. Throughout his tenure in Lexington, the arts have maintained an integral place within each student's  basic education. Coordinating an outstanding professional faculty with a supportive administration and community, Walter has continuously modeled his passion and belief that music is a lifelong endeavor that transcends, gender, age and ethnicity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his professional life, Dr. Pavasaris has positively impacted many young music educators while serving on the faculty of many institutions within the greater Boston area, including the Boston Conservatory of Music, New England Conservatory of Music, and Boston University. As a member of the music education faculty at the Boston Conservatory of Music since the late 1980s, Walter has taught a variety of methods classes as well as classes in string pedagogy and conducting. He also had  an integral part in redefining, reshaping, and changing the direction of the music education curriculum at TBC to address the needs of the contemporary educator. For 11 years, Dr. Pavasaris enthusiastically conducted the Boston University All-University Orchestra. The orchestra,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a conductor, Walter has had the distinct privilege of conducting festival orchestras in all four Massachusetts districts as well as throughout New England. In 1992 and from 1999 to 2001 Walter was the guest conductor of the U.S. Youth Ensemble String Orchestra during their European Tours. During the 2004 and 2005 seasons he served as music director of the Nashoba Youth Orchestras. Currently, he is the music director and conductor of the Arlington, MA, Philharmonic Orchestra, a post he has  held since 1980; associate music director and associate conductor of the Metrowest Orchestra; and conductor of the northshore Youth Symphony Senior Orchestra. In 1992, Dr. Pavasaris was the recipient of the Paul Smith Memorial Conductor of the Year Award presented</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his career, Walter has had the good fortune to be associated with many wonderful colleagues and students. He is however, most thankful for the patience, understanding, and encouragement of his wife Beverly and son Christopher, who currently works in my office as a staff assistant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Making music is an endeavor that can be enjoyed, cherished, and celebrated regardless of age, gender or ethnicity. It is inspiring to realize that the personal and professional contributions of Dr. Pavasaris will only continue to grow through the works of  very people that Walter has come into contact with. It is with great pride that I recognize such a dedicated visionary in the field of music education.</paragraph>
