    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I celebrate the 25th anniversary of KILI Radio on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. For 25 years, this radio station has served as the Voice of the Lakota Nation. It serves as an important communications tool for members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, some western residents of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe and the general listening public in a region that reaches as far as the sacred Black Hills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At times throughout its history, this radio station has served as an important part of the Emergency Broadcast System, getting word to listeners of severe weather, fire, or other emergency situations on the horizon. It also serves as a vital tool to inform people about community meetings, educational opportunities, danger prevention activities, and others. KILI Radio also plays a crucial role in maintaining the Lakota language on the reservation, with its DJs and other programming hosts often  speaking in Lakota or with Lakota-speaking guests. The station's coverage of sporting events is exceptionally popular with KILI listeners and is one of the station's top-ranked areas of programming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perched atop Porcupine Butte, KILI Radio plays an integral part of life on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Without its existence, lives may have been lost to emergency situations it reported over the airwaves. Lakota language preservation efforts would also have languished. I applaud KILI Radio for working tirelessly to preserve the Lakota language and culture while also promoting, educating, and entertaining listeners with the good news of Lakota youth, elders, and entrepreneurs. Whether it is coverage  of basketball tournaments, conferences on issues of importance to the Lakota people or holding politicians' feet to the fire, KILI Radio is a way of life for the Pine Ridge community. I wish to commend the efforts of all of KILI Radio's staff and volunteers I especially want to congratulate Tom Casey on 23 years of service to the radio station. He serves both as a radio voice, and a man behind the scenes to ensure KILI's survival.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to recognize the efforts of those who came together with the vision for the wind turbine that was erected earlier this month. On a practical level, the turbine will generate energy to power the radio station and its electrical needs. One cannot overlook the symbolism however, to imagine KILI Radio again operating off the grid, and on its own terms. Congratulations, KILI Radio on your silver anniversary and thank you for all that you have done and all that you continue to do.</paragraph>
