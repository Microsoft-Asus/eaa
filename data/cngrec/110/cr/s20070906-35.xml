  <narrative>HONORING MARY McALENEY -- (Senate - September 06, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11209">S11209</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I commend a Mainer who has gone above and beyond the call of duty in public service to our State and the Nation. On June 30 of this year, Mary McAleney retired from her position as district director of the U.S. Small Business Administration's Maine district Office after serving in that capacity for 9 dedicated years. Her retirement from this post is a loss to all of Maine's 151,000 small businesses. Mary has always worked with the best interests of Maine's small  businesses in mind, and her efforts on behalf of our State's small firms has been widely praised. In March of this year, the Maine Small Business Development Centers named Mary their Small Business Champion for her tireless efforts to serve Mainers. Her commitment to, and enthusiasm for, small enterprises has impressed all who have had the privilege of working with her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will never forget when, in the spring of 2006 following devastating flooding in York County, Mary helped to organize a tour for me of the damage. On very short notice, she made arrangements to visit numerous businesses affected by the flooding, rallying business leaders to stay optimistic and begin the recovery process. Over the years, Mary proved time and again that she could be relied upon in times of crisis to assist small businesses in need, and as a Mainer herself, she knew exactly how  to be helpful, knew the right person to call, and found a way to get results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mary's public service began with her work as a staffer in the Maine Legislature. Leaving Augusta, Mary came to Washington to work for former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, where she served as chief of staff. Prior to her appointment to the Maine SBA, Mary served as district director for the Massachusetts SBA from 1995 to 1998. Without any doubt, it is clear from the first time Mary meets anyone that Mary McAleney's passion is Maine! She grew up in eastern Maine, in the town of Vanceboro,  where she undoubtedly learned the value of sustaining a rural economy, and realized the challenges many Mainers from rural areas of the State face in order to support a family. Throughout the years, Mary has demonstrated this zeal by her remarkable ability to work with people from all sides of the spectrum, because she is among them in spirit and determination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State of Maine owes a debt of gratitude to Mary McAleney for the outstanding work she has done fighting for Maine's small businesses. While she will be sorely missed at the SBA, I know Mary will continue her distinguished service to Maine in innovative and beneficial ways. I wish my good friend continued success and offer my sincere appreciation for her devotion to Maine's small business community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. President, for affording me the opportunity to speak about this truly exceptional Mainer and American.</paragraph>
