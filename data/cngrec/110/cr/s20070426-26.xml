    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to commemorate and pay tribute to the life of a great Washingtonian, a great American, and someone who in the State of Washington will be remembered for his great contributions and who will be remembered across our country. I am talking about our former Washington State Speaker of the House, John L. O'Brien, who died this past week at the age of 95. Speaker O'Brien actually passed away on the last day of this year's legislative session, almost an appropriate  dedication for him for the remembrance of his service in our State government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to say John L. O'Brien was a good friend, a mentor, and someone who imparted a lot of political wisdom in the State of Washington. He served in our State legislature for 52 years, from 1939 to 1993, and he served as speaker of the house for a chunk of that period, 1955 to 1963. He served under nine different Governors. At one point in time, I believe, he held the record in our country for the longest serving State legislator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He did a tremendous job as majority leader; I am sure at times as minority leader; as speaker, as I mentioned, speaker pro tem. I believe he served on every single committee in our State legislature. He led our State's government through some great challenges  for us and for our country. He literally was in office when the United States went to declare World War II in 1954. He was speaker when the first flight of the Boeing 707 was completed. He saw the  Space Needle completed for the World's Fair that was held in Seattle in 1962. He was there when Microsoft was founded. He led our State through the challenging times responding to Mount St. Helen's eruption in 1980. And he was there to lead our celebration as Washington State celebrated our 100th anniversary as a State in 1989.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But John O'Brien also was a man who thought about the future, and he has an unending list of accomplishments that literally touched the lives of thousands of Washingtonians. He changed the course of history in our State by his generosity, by his leadership, by his commitment, his inspiration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know my remarks will not do him justice, but I just want to say that he did a lot in a time and period of making sure that despite the lofty position he held in the house, he never lost track of what the constituents of his district and of our State cared about. He worked on property tax relief for seniors and low-income individuals. He fought for prescription and over-the-counter drug information labeling so that seniors knew what kind of products they were purchasing. He was a champion of  State employee collective bargaining and workplace safety issues. He sponsored Washington State's first clean air act. That might sound like something lots of people do, but he actually sponsored that legislation in 1940. So he was ahead of his time in thinking about Washington State's environment and how to preserve the pristine quality of life that is so important to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He helped to establish one of the first programs in the Nation to commit a percentage of our construction budget for the creation of art. He helped save and restore Franklin High School. He worked to make sure we established a drug-free zone and got legislation passed removing the sales tax from items sold at charitable auctions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John O'Brien represented one of the most diverse neighborhoods in Seattle, an area called the Rainer Valley. The Rainer Valley began as an Irish and Italian community of immigrants, and with Speaker O'Brien's leadership, it helped to incorporate various waves of new immigrants from various communities: the Chinese-American community, Japanese, Filipino, African American, Orthodox Jews, Vietnamese, East African, and Hispanic citizens. Now, it is, as I said, one of the most diverse areas of our  State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Seattle Times ran a story about Speaker O'Brien's life and how his values were shaped, they said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. O'Brien was just 7 years old when his Irish immigrant father, a detective with the Seattle Police, came home after a particularly tough day on the job. He turned to his eldest son and asked, rhetorically, "What will ever become of you if something happens to me?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two years later his father was shot and killed while on duty. That left the young Mr. O'Brien to help his mother, also an Irish immigrant, care for their siblings. By the time he was a teenager, he was bringing home a paycheck as a truckdriver for Keefe's Grocery in Rainier Valley. He went on to start his own accounting firm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Seattle Post-Intelligencer quoted former Governor Dan Evans, who knew John O'Brien well, who said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He knew how to lead and occasionally when things got rambunctious, he had to have a heavy gavel to get things back in order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Evans remembered one time when he challenged an O'Brien ruling, O'Brien slammed his gavel down so hard the head snapped off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While O'Brien was a fiscally conservative Democrat, he  understood what the role of the speaker required of him. He was always ready to have a good time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember that if there was ever anybody who captured the saying, "when Irish eyes are smiling," it was John O'Brien because he had a twinkle in his eye and a way to get people engaged. When I entered the State legislature at the age of 28, I was the youngest member at the time, and he was the most senior member of our legislature. Knowing of my Irish heritage background, he got me to commit to him that I would participate in St. Patrick's Day celebrations in his office by doing the Irish  jig if, in fact, he produced someone with a bagpipe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, unbeknownst to me, our secretary of state, Ralph Monroe, of Scottish heritage, had such bagpipes stored in his office and was quite frequently seen in the halls of Olympia playing the bagpipes. So on St. Patrick's Day I did participate in Speaker O'Brien's St. Patrick's Day celebration, as did our secretary of state, Ralph Monroe, and many others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope to this day that there is not a picture of my rendition of my Irish heritage dance. But I know I will always remember on St. Patrick's Day John O'Brien and his great service and his heritage in our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the last two pages of his biography, "Speaker of the House," Speaker John O'Brien sums up his philosophy on how to survive in a legislature. He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do your best, count the votes, and, win or lose, move on to other pressing issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It might stay with you for a while, but as far as being disappointed, you cannot let it remain as a personal matter because there's always another rollcall. There's always another day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can find inspiration in Speaker O'Brien's service as we face tough legislative issues here and as we face our vote today. No matter on what side of the political aisle you stand, we can all join in honoring the inspiration from others who have served and honoring the life of Speaker John L. O'Brien for his lifetime of public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My thoughts are with his family: his wife Mary, their six children, John O'Brien, Jr., Laurie, MaryAnn, Karen, Jeannie, and Paul, and to their grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John O'Brien was a great Washingtonian, a great citizen of our country, and we will miss him, and we will try to live up to his accomplishments and to his legacy.</paragraph>
