  <speaking speaker="400381" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Democratic majority's decision to ignore the requests of our intelligence community has endangered our national security. Why do House Democrats refuse to give the intelligence community the tools they need to protect American lives?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A strong bipartisan bill passed the Senate by a vote of 68</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has no greater responsibility than to ensure that our intelligence-gathering laws are strong and our Nation is safe from future attacks. Let's hope, for the sake of our country, the Democratic leaders will decide before it's too late to pass the bipartisan Senate bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="HONORING ESSIE MAE REED DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTH">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, here on Black History Month, I'm very pleased to salute Essie Mae Reed from Tampa, Florida, a true community hero. Essie Mae Reed has been an outspoken voice for the poor and struggling families in Tampa for decades. As a resident of the Central  Park Village housing project in 1967, she created the first tenants association and ultimately advocated on behalf of thousands of families in Tampa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Essie Mae Reed established the Boys and Girls Club. She ensured children could go to the community college for enrichment programs. She publicized unsanitary conditions. She ensured children will receive lunch in schools. She fought to have hot water heaters installed in public housing. She forced a change in public housing policy that barred single mother s from public housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Essie Mae Reed was the first African American woman to run for the Tampa City Council; and when they charged her a substantial qualifying fee, she challenged it, and the Federal district court threw it out and ruled it unconstitutional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Essie Mae Reed is a Tampa and American treasure. She stood up for so many that didn't have a voice and improved lives throughout our community.</paragraph>
