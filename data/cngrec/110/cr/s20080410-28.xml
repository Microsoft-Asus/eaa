  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="LANCE CORPORAL CODY WANKEN">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great sorrow I honor a fallen soldier. American hero Marine LCpl Cody Wanken was seriously injured near Fallujah, Iraq, last fall. He subsequently died from these injuries on April 2, 2008. My deepest sympathy and prayers go out to Cody's parents, Rick and Susan Wanken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cody was a machine gunner in the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division. He was a 2006 graduate of Hampton-Dumont High School and served as the 2005-06 president of the Iowa Jobs for America's Graduates, Hampton-Dumont chapter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his youth, Cody was a standout athlete. He played on a Hampton youth baseball team that took first place at the Iowa games, and he was named to the Class 3A, District 2 defensive team after his senior year of high school. Cody returned to speak at Hampton-Dumont while recuperating from his injuries obtained in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cody will be forever remembered by his family, friends, and community members. One of Cody's former coaches said, "He was very, very proud to serve in the Marines. You could just tell." For this, we are all indebted for his service to our country. I express gratitude on behalf of all Americans to the family of a true American patriot, fallen hero Marine LCpl Cody Wanken.</paragraph>
