    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is really simple: If you want to help rural small town poor individuals in this country, we have to get the price of gas down. Here is the problem: January 2001, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $23. When this majority came in, it was $58. Now it is $134. What does that translate into? From $1.45 to $2.23 to $4.07. Add climate change, 50 cents additional. $4.55, if you calculate climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is the solution? The solution is all of the above. Outer Continental Shelf exploration and recovery, coal-to-liquid technologies, solar and wind, renewable fuels. We need to do all the above, and you all need to help us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to bring a bill to the floor that brings on more supply. We are willing to work with you. More supply is the only thing that we can do to bring down the cost of fuel which will help middle- and low-income Americans. We ask you to join us.</paragraph>
