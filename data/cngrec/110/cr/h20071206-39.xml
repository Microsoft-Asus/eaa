    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, all of us are interested in moving this country forward on a defined energy policy. And we had, just an hour ago, an open debate on how we could move America forward. I'm delighted that part of the effort in the legislation just passed by this House emphasized new CAFE standards so that there can be greater mileage on vehicles that Americans may purchase, and, yes, a lowering of the cost of gasoline, but also a lowering of the utilization of gas by getting  greater mileage; compromise between the energy industry and, of course, those who make automobiles in Detroit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition are the emphasis on alternative fuels, the research to help us expand greening of America and the emphasis on creating new jobs and looking at alternative fuels. But I also believe that we must focus on the existence of fossil fuels, oil and gas, and be able to develop oil and gas domestically, particularly, in the gulf region. And so I hope that we will expand that debate as we go forward in making America independent as relates to energy.</paragraph>
