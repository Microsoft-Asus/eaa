    <paragraph>Mr. President, today we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the historic Good Friday agreement, which put Northern Ireland on the path to reconciliation and peace after decades of violence, bloodshed, and deep mistrust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Northern Ireland and the courageous leaders of the political parties in Northern Ireland, Ireland, and Great Britain, all deserve special recognition on this day for their deep and unwavering commitment to peace. We salute them for their extraordinary accomplishment and difficult compromises they were able to achieve to create a greater and better future for the people of Northern Ireland. Their success is an example to the world of what can be accomplished with courage and commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The benefits and advances have been extraordinary over the past decade. Guns are out of politics, and power is being shared on an equal basis. Future generations in Northern Ireland will live in peace, stability and prosperity, and they will do so because of the extraordinary commitment by leaders on all sides to a peaceful resolution of conflict based upon mutual respect for all the people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All Americans congratulate the people of Northern Ireland on this auspicious anniversary. They were truly blessed to have such extraordinary peacemakers among them, and we pray for similar leadership in resolving the other bitter conflicts that challenge our world today.</paragraph>
