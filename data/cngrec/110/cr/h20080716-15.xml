    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American economy has lost nearly half a million jobs this year with six consecutive months of negative job growth. In fact, under this administration our economy has the slowest record of job growth since the Hoover administration, has added $3.5 trillion dollars to the national debt and seen the value of the dollar plummet. Gasoline is $4.10 a gallon, the stock market has flatlined, the financial industry is in crisis, and the housing industry teeters on the brink.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We simply cannot afford to continue the same failed policies of the past 8 years. And while Senator McCain's chief economist says that it's all in our heads, that the Americans are just whining about the economy, Democrats recognize the problem and are working to provide some relief. And though we lack cooperation from a President who doesn't share our values, we have shown leadership by overriding his vetoes four times now and counting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats in Congress are leading the way and moving towards a new direction for our economy.</paragraph>
