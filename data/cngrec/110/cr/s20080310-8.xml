  <narrative>PEACE CORPS -- (Senate - March 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1787">S1787</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I had the good fortune to meet earlier today with the head of the Peace Corps. His name is Ron Tschetter--a wonderful man who was approved overwhelmingly not that long ago by the full Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Peace Corps is one of the programs that is so good for this country and the world. We have a little over 8,000 Peace Corps volunteers. We should have twice as many. The President said a couple years ago he was going to double the Peace Corps from 7,000 to 14,000. That has not happened. He has increased it by a few hundred, and that is very, very important. From Nevada, we have 22 Peace Corps volunteers out of the 8,000. They are from all over the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have had the good fortune of being able to travel as a representative of our country around the world over the last several decades, every place I go, I visit with Peace Corps volunteers because there is no group of individuals that does more for our country in setting good, high-quality standards than the Peace Corps volunteers. They do great work, and I am very proud of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These Peace Corps volunteers, when they are interviewed, are not Democrats or Republicans, they are Americans, and they do great public service. They are true public servants, and I am very proud of the work they have done and will continue to do throughout the world on behalf of America.</paragraph>
