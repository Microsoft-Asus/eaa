    <paragraph>Madam President, today I recognize Lemmon, SD. The town of Lemmon will celebrate its 100th anniversary this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded in 1907, Lemmon is located in Perkins County near the North Dakota border. It was named after George Edward Lemmon, who managed the largest fenced pasture in the world and is a member of the National Cowboy Hall of Fame. The town of Lemmon is home to the world's largest petrified wood park, which was constructed by unemployed workers during the Great Depression. Lemmon has been a successful and thriving community for the past 100 years and I am confident that it will continue to serve  as an example of South Dakota values and traditions for the next 100 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to offer my congratulations to the citizens of Lemmon on their anniversary and wish them continued prosperity in the years to come.</paragraph>
