  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>The House will soon entertain a resolution relating to the surge. It is a nonbinding resolution. The war, however, is binding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The supplemental resolution relating to funding will give Congress an opportunity to take some binding action related to the war. Congress' real power is to cut off funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Money is there right now to bring the troops home, and money to bring the troops home is part of a plan that involves bringing in international peacekeepers while our troops leave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a 12-point plan which I have circulated among Members of Congress as to how we can get out of Iraq. The American people will not tolerate nonbinding resolutions as being an excuse for strong and substantive action to end the war as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
