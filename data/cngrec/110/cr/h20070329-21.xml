    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I had an honor today that will be forever embedded in my heart; and that was to watch the Tuskegee Airmen, of which my father-in-law, Phillip Ferguson Lee, was an active and proud member, be honored with the Congressional Gold Medal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank with all of my heart Representative CHARLIE RANGEL, Senator Levin, and all of the participants who commemorated and celebrated brave men who sacrificed their life in World War II but yet were treated worse than the Nazi soldiers who were captured and held here in the United States. In spite of color and racism, they rose to the highest occasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am so proud to be part of this majority that supported an emergency supplemental that would dignify our troops and bring them home with success and a budget today that was voted with the largest amount for dollars for veterans in the history of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you to my father-in-law, Phillip Ferguson Lee, and all the Tuskegee Airmen who now are so proud to receive the Congressional Gold Medal. But, more importantly, they are proud to be Americans, World War II veterans who never, never denied their leadership in the United States of America. God bless them and God bless the United States of America.</paragraph>
