    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have not had an opportunity to speak to the distinguished Republican leader about this, but I ask unanimous consent that the vote, rather than starting at 9:45, start at 9:55 a.m. This will still allow those who are attending hearings to get there immediately after casting their vote.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask consent that all other elements of the previous order remain in effect.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the effect of this consent agreement is that the rollcall vote will occur at 9:55. We will proceed then to the water resources bill. Since this is a very bipartisan bill, I hope cloture is invoked on the motion and shortly thereafter we can proceed to the bill so the managers, Senators Boxer and Inhofe, can work toward completing that action.</paragraph>
