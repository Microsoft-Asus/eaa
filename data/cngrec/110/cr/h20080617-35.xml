  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the mission of public radio is to create a better informed public that is challenged and invigorated by a deeper understanding and appreciation of events, ideas, and cultures;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the programming content created and distributed by public radio is based on 3  core values: qualities of mind, qualities of heart, and qualities of craft, which exemplify the inherent meaning of localism by placing value and financial investment in local and regional assets to gather and distribute a collection of programming that informs and improves community;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas public radio is known for distinctive, award-winning programming that includes "Morning Edition", "All Things Considered", "A Prairie Home Companion", "Marketplace", "Speaking of Faith", and "This American Life";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas America's more than 800 public radio stations serve every State and every congressional district with news, information, cultural, and music programming that are unique to free radio;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas some 33,000,000 Americans listen to public radio programming each week;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the public radio audience has doubled in the past 15 years and has increased by some 70 percent in the past decade;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas public radio stations are licensed by community foundations, colleges, universities, school boards, libraries, and other local nonprofit entities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas public radio stations are locally licensed, locally staffed, and locally programmed, and have tailored their programming to meet the needs of local audiences;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas public radio stations on average receive more than 85 percent of their annual funding from local sources;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas public radio's public service finds expression through a deep music discovery, education, and enrichment experience for both its audience and the performers, singer-songwriters, musicians, lyricists, and composers, which places the greatest emphasis on a valued partnership with performers to bring all facets of music into the lives of its audience in a way that is found nowhere else;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas public radio has preserved and enhanced the archetypal musical formats of American music history, such as jazz, classical, folk, bluegrass, the blues, and Celtic;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas public radio is responding to its commitment to community-based and fact-based journalism with several initiatives, including the Local News Initiative, a national effort to increase public radio's service to communities through investments in station capacity to provide in-depth, serious, and balanced news, and Public Insight Journalism, a pioneering concept that uses citizens to help cover the news by sharing their observations, knowledge, and expertise;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas public radio has embraced digital broadcasting technology because of its inherently inclusive nature and potential to expand public service programming; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas public radio exists to serve the public interest: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) expresses support for the designation of a "Public Radio Recognition Month"; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (2) encourages the celebration of America's public radio stations for their contributions to our Nation's communities and enduring civic spirit.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, public radio, of course, is one of the things that all of us spend a great deal of time listening to. As a matter of fact, there are many of us, and many people in America, who feel that if they don't get the opportunity to listen, to know what has taken place, to recognize what is going on in our country, then they are seriously deprived.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas the mission of public radio is to create a better informed public that is challenged and invigorated by a deeper understanding and appreciation of events, ideas and cultures; and whereas public radio is almost a mainstay in hundreds of thousands and perhaps even millions of Americans' homes. We wake up in the morning, many families go to bed at night, and public radio is the balance that they need to feel that the information they are receiving is not being commercialized, that it is  information that is coming straight from wherever the purveyors have gotten it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>They are not necessarily trying to shape ideas in one direction or another, but to simply give information to people that they can use and take advantage of and make it a part of their everyday lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, based upon those facts and based upon that information, it is certainly my pleasure to express support for this legislation. I want to commend the gentleman from Oregon, Mr. Blumenauer, for introducing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I too rise in support of the resolution. National Public Radio is important. KPBS in my hometown represents a voice that provides a plethora of information that would not otherwise be available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the information that I hope they would provide would be to get to the true causes of our high oil prices. In San Diego, Public Broadcasting is playing a role in saying that $5 gas is unacceptable. Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, public radio is not yet making us aware of just why it is so high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact that over 2 billion acres are not available for exploration of oil and gas in California is part of the reason that last weekend I paid $5-plus for a gallon of gas in my home district. That, Madam Speaker, is in fact something that we need to take care of. We need to have public radio and all of our communications systems running on full bore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do note, Madam Speaker, that this is an April resolution. This is a resolution that we are so far behind in the important business of the House, we are only getting to now celebrating April of 2008 for Public Broadcasting. I find it interesting that we were so busy, and yet we didn't have time to find out what were the real causes of high oil and gas prices, why America is importing half a trillion dollars a year of other people's oil and a similar growing amount of natural gas and other resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would hope that when we get this April legislation off our plate, we would turn to the important issues of the day, certainly the incredibly high price of gas in my home district, caused by a lack of domestic exploration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And if we have just a little time, perhaps we could find out why in the midst of the sub-S meltdown, we discover that Members of this body and Members of the body on the other side of the dome were in fact getting special deals that saved themselves tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars on their home mortgages. These investigations need to happen, because we need to solve the problem of how America finds itself with financial meltdown. We need to find out what it is going to take to get American  oil and high-paying American jobs flowing again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would urge support of this resolution and yield back the balance of our time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, <bill type="hr" number="1002">H. Res. 1002</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <narrative>The question was taken.</narrative>
  <chair> In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The yeas and nays were ordered.</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX and the Chair's prior announcement, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed.</chair>
