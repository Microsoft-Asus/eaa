    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on Monday morning five libraries and five museums throughout the country were honored with medals at a ceremony that was presided over by Mrs. Laura Bush.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Memphis Library and Information Center was one of the five libraries and the only big city library to be honored. I was honored to have nominated them for that recognition and honored to be there with them when the library was so recognized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Libraries are very important to the future of this country, for people of all standings of wealth need access to books, access to computers, and access to other materials. The Memphis Library takes services to the community and gives people in their neighborhood the opportunity to read and make available to them cultural outreach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also have a television and radio station that is operated by our library, and it is an important facility, and I am proud that it's Tennessee's first facility to receive such an award and the first in the mid-South.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations to my city. You have a very proud congressman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
