  <narrative>PROTECTING OUR LIBERTIES AND OUR SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11644]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, later today the House will vote on the RESTORE Act, on electronic surveillance, which its well-intentioned authors believe will help both protect our liberties and protect our security. It does the latter, but, unfortunately, does not fully do the former.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill includes a provision that could be used to spy on Americans without warrants. There is no need for us to pass in haste yet again a bill that does not protect the citizens. We must not give in to the politics of fear. I urge our leadership to make the changes necessary to this bill so that it protects our citizens from both enemy attacks and warrantless government surveillance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, executive branch assurances that the rights of Americans will be protected through administrative procedures are no substitute for judicial protections. In recent weeks and months we have seen too many abuses of administrative warrants to find reassurance in that. We will have the best protection when agencies have to demonstrate to a court that they know what they are doing.</paragraph>
