    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are going to be in a period of morning business for an hour. The majority will control the second half of morning business, the Republicans will control the first half of morning business. We had a conversation last night, the distinguished Republican leader and I, and the decision was made at that time that we are going to do our very best on the Webb amendment to come up with a side by side so we can have, sometime today, votes on those two amendments. Following  that, there will be another amendment offered, and we will move along on this most important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
