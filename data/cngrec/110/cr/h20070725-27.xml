    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today it is an honor for me to congratulate the longest married couple in the United States, married for 82 1/2  incredible years. They live in my district, Clarence and Mayme Vail of Hugo, Minnesota. They have six wonderful children, 39 grandchildren, 101 great-grandchildren, and 40 great-great-grandchildren. It is almost beyond belief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At 101 and 99 years of age, what is the Vails' secret to success? Clarence says "Avoid debt, strive for simple, clean living, no public arguments, feed your faith, and accept your spouse as is." Then Clarence went on to say, "Pick a good woman and let her lead the way." That is good advice from a humble Minnesotan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations, Clarence and Mayme Vail of Hugo, Minnesota, on 82 1/2  years of marriage; the longest married couple in the United States. Congratulations, lovebirds.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
