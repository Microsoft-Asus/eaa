  <narrative>LOBBYING REFORM -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H9058]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400120" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last year, we promised to break the link between lobbyists and legislators here in Washington and to fundamentally change the culture of corruption that has become accepted practice here. This new law is on the doorstep of becoming law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we will pass this bill that fixes an institutional problem with an institutional solution. Our bill mandates unprecedented disclosure of lobbying activities and turns the spotlight on special interests who have grown too comfortable with their special access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most importantly, our legislation levels the playing field between the special interests and the voters. When the gavel comes down on the Speaker's podium, it is intended to open the people's House, not the auction house.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people, and not paid lobbyists on behalf of the special interests, should have access to their government 365 days a year. Election day should not just be a formality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the Senate must do its work and pass this legislation. Americans have waited long enough for this Congress to pass real lobbying reform. It is time to turn this bill into law and give the American people a government as good as its people.</paragraph>
