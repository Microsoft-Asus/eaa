    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in recognizing Isadore Erwin "I.E." Millstone of Saint Louis, MO. It is an honor to celebrate I.E.'s centennial birthday and to pay tribute to all that he has accomplished in his 100 years. Through his business and philanthropic interests, Mr. Millstone has helped shape the course of the city of Saint Louis over the past century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born on January 6, 1907, in North Saint Louis, I.E. graduated from Soldan High School in 1923. He then continued his education at Washington University in St. Louis, studying architecture and engineering, and graduating in 1927.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his life, I.E. has been an integral member and patriarch of the Saint Louis community. He is a life member of the United Hebrew Congregation in Saint Louis, where he earned money as a child checking hats and coats, and served as global president of the World Federation of YMHA's and Jewish Community Centers Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following the Great Depression, I.E. formed Millstone Construction Company with his wife and became involved in the creation of many landmarks throughout the Saint Louis area--due in part to his revolutionary use of reinforced concrete. These projects include the old Busch Stadium, Highway 40, and the Jewish Community center in Creve Coeur. As the city is being redeveloped, both the old Busch Stadium and Highway 40 are being transformed to serve a new generation, but the original structures are  forever a part of the city's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A giant among men, I.E. demonstrates a passion that does not lie solely in building Saint Louis from a physical standpoint. As a dedicated philanthropist, I.E. has supported many causes, including funding a program to support nearly 60 scholarships at Washington University in St. Louis. His dedication to helping others, however, is not limited to the Saint Louis area. Following World War II, I.E. joined a small group of builders to help the new State of Israel construct emergency housing for  thousands of immigrants, many of whom were Holocaust survivors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in honoring I.E. Millstone for 100 years of dedicated service to Saint Louis and to the world. I am proud to recognize this extraordinary Missourian and wish him many more healthy and happy years to come.</paragraph>
