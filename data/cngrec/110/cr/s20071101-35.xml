    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good friend and great Nebraskan, former U.S. Representative Peter Hoagland, who passed away Tuesday at the age of 66. Peter was a very special friend to all who knew him. His tenure in Congress coincided with my first 4 years serving as Governor of the State of Nebraska, and I will always remember Peter's thoughtful advice and advocacy on issues important to our mutual constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peter worked to do what he believed was right for his district and our state. An Omaha native and alumnus of Omaha Central High School, Peter represented the good people of Nebraska's largest metropolitan area in one capacity or another for 14 years through two terms in the Nebraska Legislature and three representing Nebraska's Second District in the U.S. House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Elected to the Nebraska Unicameral in 1978, Peter later assumed a leadership role as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. This role suited him well, as he was a Yale-educated attorney, having completed his law degree in 1968 after serving our country as a U.S. Army intelligence officer. Peter was active on important topics such as ground water protection, and he spearheaded the passage of landmark drunk-driving legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peter was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1988, where he served three terms. He focused his efforts on the inner workings of his committees. Peter was a workhorse, not a show horse; and he made his presence felt on many issues, particularly those pertaining to banking and the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peter Hoagland was a true leader; and while he may have left public service, he never left public life. As a tribute to his immense legacy, Nebraska Democrats honored Peter with the Hall of Fame Award at the Morrison-Exon Dinner earlier this year. I am grateful we had that opportunity to let Peter know how much he meant to all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer my most sincere condolences to Peter's wife Barbara and their family. Peter's passion for service, his dynamic leadership, and his unwavering dedication will remain a source of inspiration to all who knew him.</paragraph>
