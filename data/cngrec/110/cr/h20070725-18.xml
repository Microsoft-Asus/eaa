  <narrative>NO PERMANENT BASES IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8403]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yesterday, the President of the United States went to South Carolina to address the United States military to convince them that the al Qaeda network in Iraq is part of the international network of al Qaeda. But as I rise to support the legislation that will appear on the floor today, No Permanent Bases in Iraq, I rise vigorously to support this important legislation, that I have co-sponsored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Intelligence Estimate has been very clear, and that is that al Qaeda has become stronger because of our military presence in Iraq. It's time now to make the statement and the decision, no permanent military bases of the United States in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four thousand lives, almost, of our soldiers have been lost. They are our heroes. We claim they are our heroes. They've done their job. It is time now, Mr. President, to redeploy our soldiers in a safe manner and recognize the misdirected war in Iraq, political reconciliation is the answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time now for the Iraqis and the Prime Minister to stand up, along with the sister states in the region, and establish the reconciliation goverment for Iraq. Please support No Permanent Bases in Iraq.</paragraph>
