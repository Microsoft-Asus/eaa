    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, assuming we get there, how strange the politics of today will seem to future generations. Here we are debating whether to send more troops into a nation we are already illegally occupying for oil. Here we are contemplating the U.S. invading another nation, Iran. I wonder if we would be having that discussion if Iran did not have a tremendous amount of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All around us we are in conflict because we are addicted to oil. Our energy consumption choices are causing global warming which is causing weather patterns to change. Think about what we have seen in the last few weeks alone: snow in Los Angeles, billions of dollars in damage to California citrus crops because of a freeze.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The burning of fossil fuels has contributed to erratic weather. Last year, we had the warmest weather in the United States continent in 112 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, instead of separating the world with our politics, it is imperative that we bring the world together to meet the challenge of global climate change. I am hopeful that in his State of the Union Address next week, the President is going to take a direction to do that.</paragraph>
