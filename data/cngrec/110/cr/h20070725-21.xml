    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last Tuesday, Secretary Jim Nicholson resigned from his position at the Department of Veterans Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a highly decorated combat veteran, his experience in the Army for over 22 years gave him insight into the needs of veterans. He has implemented many reforms since assuming the leadership of the VA in February 2005. He established electronic medical records for the nearly 8 million people in the VA health care program. This enabled the successful transition of veterans from hospitals damaged by Hurricane Katrina and Rita.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Mr. Nicholson improved care for veterans with brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder, mandating screening of all returning veterans for signs of PTSD, and adding mental health services at more than 100 medical centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secretary Nicholson also hired suicide prevention counselors at each of the VA's 153 facilities and established a 24-hour national suicide prevention hotline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Secretary Nicholson for his commitment and leadership, and wish him well in his future endeavors. God bless him.</paragraph>
