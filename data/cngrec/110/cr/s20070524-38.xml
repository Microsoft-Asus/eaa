    <paragraph>Mr. President, Tuesday, May 22 was a memorable day in the life of the U.S. Senate. In keeping with longstanding tradition, each year, Senate spouses gather to give a luncheon in honor of the First Lady of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, Landra Reid served as Chairman and Jeanne Warner served as co-chairman. The theme was a unique one, entitled, "100 Dresses." This year, Jeanne Warner became Chairman, Grace Nelson became co-chairman and Landra Reid, together with over 20 Senate spouses, organized another highly successful and enjoyable luncheon. This year's event, entitled "Heartfelt Safari," focused on the President and Mrs. Bush's initiative to help alleviate the plight of malaria in Africa. The number of deaths  this year from malaria could be as high as two million, largely among children in Africa. Part of the proceeds from the luncheon will be donated to a well-respected not-for-profit charity--Malaria No More--that works to alleviate this tragic suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the evening, our two Senate leaders presided over a dinner honoring the Senate spouses. Senator REID opened with a moving framework of remarks, humorously recounting how the esteemed author, Ralph Waldo Emerson, once spoke for over 2 hours at a Harvard University event in the 1830s. He quickly assured the audience he would not seek to match Emerson, and he then proceeded to give a very warm introduction of an honored guest, Placido Domingo. The renowned singer regaled the audience with  anecdotes about his career and about America's growing interest in opera.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator McCONNELL concluded the evening, reciting the vital role performed by Senate spouses through the years. His remarks were warmly received by so many colleagues that I am privileged to offer for the RECORD, on behalf of all Senators, his thoughts, and I ask unanimous consent they be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
