    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say briefly, the majority leader has it entirely right, we are in the process of discussing a consent agreement under which the Webb amendment would be voted upon and the alternative, which will be offered by Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM, who will be over to speak shortly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hopefully, we will be able to work that out and begin to make progress on the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
