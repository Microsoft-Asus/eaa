  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, every month this year the Bush administration and the Bush economy has shed more jobs than it has produced, leaving millions of American workers competing against each other for the remaining jobs. We haven't seen this many people enter unemployment so quickly in over three decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the House will consider providing up to 13 weeks of extended unemployment benefits to workers who have exhausted the 26 weeks of regular benefits. The bill will provide relief to American families struggling through these tough economic times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unemployment benefits are also important to economic recovery, with absolutely every dollar of the benefit checks going right back into the economy. And while the economy continues to weaken and costs for gasoline and food skyrocket every day, the need for government help is clear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, our Republican colleagues continue to oppose these efforts to assist millions of out-of-work Americans, even though they supported a similar extension in 2002, when job loss numbers were not nearly as bad as they are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as our economy continues to face tough times, Washington should explore every possible option to help those struggling. That is exactly what Democrats will do today in Congress, extend those benefits.</paragraph>
