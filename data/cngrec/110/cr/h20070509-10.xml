  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in March, the Homeland Security Committee unanimously approved a bill to authorize funding for the Department of Homeland Security for the coming year. It wasn't a perfect bill, but it was one the committee accepted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the liberal leadership plans to strip the most critical provisions in the legislation. These are not controversial points that should make my colleagues on the other side of the aisle uncomfortable. Unless, of course, the Democrats do not agree with an increased emphasis on immigration enforcement at the ports or secure biometric identification for aliens captured at sea or critical funding to protect America's food supply. But, as we've all seen since the Democrats took over in January,  we know that is the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it actually gets worse. The liberal leadership voted against allowing noncontroversial amendments to increase information sharing between DHS and cops on the beat, allowing DHS to investigate Social Security fraud at the workplace, and increased fines of employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill makes a mockery of the democratic process, does nothing extra to secure our borders and will, unfortunately, probably make our Nation less safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Welcome to Homeland Security, Democrat style.</paragraph>
