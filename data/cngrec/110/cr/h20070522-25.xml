  <speaking speaker="412189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week this House passed a bipartisan defense authorization bill. The legislation includes two provisions to which  President Bush objected. One gives our military a well-deserved pay raise, and the other offers surviving spouses of fallen armed servicemembers an additional $40 per month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our men and women in uniform and their family members have sacrificed enormously. They have earned honor, and they deserve the benefits that would be provided to them in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the President has repeatedly called for supporting our troops and their families, it appears that his words do not match his deeds. On the other hand, this Congress has committed to providing our troops the equipment, training and benefits they need and deserve, ensuring our veterans get the care to which they are entitled and caring for our military families who endure many issues when their loved ones serve overseas and when they return home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation owes our soldiers, our veterans and our families more than just empty talk.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
