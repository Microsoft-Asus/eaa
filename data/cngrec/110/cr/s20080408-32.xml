  <speaking speaker="300073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I opposed going to war in Iraq. I opposed the escalation of American troop levels. And I still do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Bush administration proposed the escalation of U.S. forces in Iraq, the President said it would enable the Iraqi government to achieve political reconciliation. Our troops have done their part. Yet as we ask our troops to do more, the Iraqi government does less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we were fighting the surge, the Iraqi parliament was on vacation. While our troops were wounded, dying, and away from their families, Prime Minister al-Maliki was running up a budget surplus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Iraqi government has failed to make their country safer or more stable; they have failed to hold provisional elections, reform their oil laws or disarm the militias. This is a failure in leadership. The battle of Basra was a disaster. We know that many members of the Iraqi military fought bravely and steadfastly. But we also know that more than 1,000 deserted or refused to fight. Once again, American troops had to step forward to salvage the operation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our troops have performed bravely and effectively. Yet a great American military cannot be a substitute for a weak Iraqi government. It is time to come home. We must bring our troops home, swiftly and safely.</paragraph>
