  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize a community in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th anniversary. From June 28 to July 1, the residents of Ellendale will gather to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ellendale is a community of about 1,550 on the border between North and South Dakota. It was founded in 1881 in anticipation of the Milwaukee Road Railroad. It was the first white settlement in the county and, as the first stop on the railroad in the region, it became a great distributing point for settlers' supplies. It was named in honor of the wife of Milwaukee Road Rail Road official S. S. Merrill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Ellendale is the county seat of Dickey County. It is also home to an Opera House which, at one time, was the largest between Minneapolis and Seattle. The Organization of the People in Ellendale for the Restoration of the Arts hopes to reopen the Opera House, which is currently undergoing restoration, so that it can, once again, have live productions. In addition, the Cole Memorial Museum hosts numerous artifacts and memorabilia showcasing the Ellendale area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those who call Ellendale home, it is a comfortable place to live, work, and play. The people of Ellendale are enthusiastic about their community and the quality of life it offers. Nearby Pheasant Lake offers a wealth of recreational opportunities from fishing to boating to camping. The community has a wonderful quasquicentennial weekend planned that includes school reunions, a Walk of Fame inductee banquet, a golf tournament, and a Historical Pageant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Ellendale, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well in the future. By honoring Ellendale and all the other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Ellendale that have helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ellendale has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
