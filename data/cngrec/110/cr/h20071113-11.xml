    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (<bill type="hc" number="229">H. Con. Res. 229</bill>) expressing the sense of the Congress that the United States should seek a review of compliance by all nations with the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas' conservation and management recommendations for Atlantic bluefin tuna and other species, and should pursue strengthened conservation and management measures to facilitate the recovery of the Atlantic  bluefin tuna, and for other purposes, as amended.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.</narrative>
  <narrative>The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hc" number="229">H. Con. Res. 229</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas Atlantic bluefin tuna are a valuable commercial and recreational fishery of the United States and many other countries;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (hereinafter referred to as "the Convention") was signed in 1966;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Convention established the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (hereinafter referred to as "the Commission") to coordinate international research and develop conservation and management recommendations on Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly migratory species in the Atlantic Ocean and the adjacent seas, including the Mediterranean Sea;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in 1974, the Commission adopted its first conservation and management recommendation to ensure the sustainability of Atlantic bluefin tuna throughout the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, while allowing for the maximum sustainable catch for food and other purposes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in 1981, for management purposes, the Commission adopted a working hypothesis of two Atlantic bluefin tuna stocks, with one occurring west of 45 degree west longitude (hereinafter referred to as the "western Atlantic stock") and the other occurring east of 45 degree west longitude (hereinafter referred to as the "eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean stock");&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas since 1981, the Commission has adopted additional and more restrictive conservation and management recommendations for the western Atlantic stock, and these recommendations have been implemented by nations fishing west of 45 degree west longitude;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas despite adoption and full implementation of a science-based rebuilding program for the western Atlantic stock by countries fishing west of 45 degree west longitude, catches and catch rates remain very low;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in contrast to the conservation and management measures implemented for the western Atlantic stock, total allowable catches for the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean stock have been consistently set at levels significantly above scientific recommendations intended to maintain bluefin tuna populations at levels that will permit the maximum sustainable catch;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas compliance with eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean stock quotas by parties to the Convention that harvest that stock has been very poor, most recently with harvests exceeding such total allowable catch levels by over 50 percent for each of the last 4 years;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas poor management and compliance with recommendations for the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean stock are of grave concern because the condition of the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean stock could adversely affect recovery of the western Atlantic stock due to mixing between the two stocks;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas recent scientific data shows considerable mixing of the two stocks and additional research on stock mixing will improve the understanding of the relationship between the two stocks and the fisheries for such stocks, which will assist in the management of these species throughout their ranges;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas poor data reporting on eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean stock quotas has frequently thwarted efforts by the Commission to assign quota overharvests to specific countries;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas many Commission members fishing east of 45 degree west longitude do not comply with other Commission recommendations to control eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna fisheries and conserve this overfished resource and, more generally, lack of compliance with Commission recommendations is an ongoing problem;</narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the Commission's Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (hereinafter referred to as "SCRS") noted in its 2006 report that the fishing mortality rate for the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean stock may be more than three times the level that would permit the stock to stabilize at the maximum sustainable catch level, and continuing to fish at the level of recent years "is expected to drive the spawning biomass to a very low level" giving "rise to a high risk of fishery and  stock collapse";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the SCRS has recommended that the annual harvest levels for eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna be reduced from 32,000 metric tons to approximately 15,000 metric tons to halt decline of the resource and initiate recovery;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in 2006, the Commission adopted the "Recommendation by ICCAT to Establish a Multi-Annual Recovery Plan for Bluefin Tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean" (hereinafter referred to as the "Recovery Plan") containing a wide range of management and monitoring and  control measures designed to facilitate the recovery of the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna stock; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Recovery Plan is inadequate and allows overfishing and stock decline to continue, and initial information indicates that implementation of the plan in 2007 by many eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna-harvesting countries has been poor, reflecting a business-as-usual attitude from the countries harvesting this stock that is unacceptable in light of the 2006 SCRS assessment showing a high risk of a fishery and stock collapse: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that the United States, through the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (hereinafter in this concurrent resolution referred to as the "Commission"), should--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) pursue a review and assessment of compliance with conservation and management measures adopted by the Commission and in effect for the 2006 eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna fishery, occurring east of 45 degree west longitude, and other fisheries that are subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, including data collection and reporting requirements;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) seek to address noncompliance by nations with such measures through appropriate actions, including, as appropriate, deducting a proportion of a future quota for a country to compensate for such country exceeding its quota in prior years;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) pursue a meaningful discussion of the implementation and effectiveness of the Commission recommendation entitled "Recommendation by ICCAT to Establish a Multi-Annual Recovery Plan for Bluefin Tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean" (Recommendation 06-05), including seeking detailed explanations from Commission members that have failed to fully implement the terms of the recommendation; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (4) seek to strengthen the conservation and management of the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna by making recommendations to halt the decline of the stock and begin to rebuild it.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) and the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Guam?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Concurrent Resolution 229 sends a message encouraging the 42 member nations attending the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas to take actions to stop the overfishing of bluefin tuna.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1981, fishermen in the United States and other nations in the Western Atlantic have curtailed fishing to help the bluefin recover. At the same time, other nations in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean have continued to fish at levels exceeding limits recommended by the scientists. If serious conservation actions are not taken, we will lose the bluefin tuna.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Concurrent Resolution 229 demonstrates our support for the U.S. delegation and other nations attending the meeting in Turkey to act decisively to conserve bluefin tuna.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Congressman Frank Pallone for introducing this resolution, and I urge all Members to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 229, promoting the conservation and management of the Atlantic bluefin tuna.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States has been instrumental in working towards a viable and successful rebuilding plan for western Atlantic bluefin tuna. Unfortunately, the countries fishing on the eastern bluefin tuna stock have repeatedly ignored the recommendations of the scientific committee and set quotas for eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna at unsustainable levels. To add insult to injury, those countries have not even complied with these unsustainable quotas, having continued to fish at levels far over the unsustainable  quota level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This concurrent resolution is very timely, within the 20th meeting of the Tuna Commission, occurring this week in Turkey. The U.S. delegation should continue its leadership role and propose additional conservation measures for eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna. Moreover, the delegation should work to get the Commission to adopt viable compliance measures and, if necessary, sanctions for those countries that continue to ignore the conservation and management recommendations of the Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge a "yes" vote on this particular bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, again, I request that my colleagues support this House Concurrent Resolution 229, as amended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, <bill type="hc" number="229">H. Con. Res. 229</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution, as amended, was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
