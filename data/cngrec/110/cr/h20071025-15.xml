  <narrative>PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF <bill type="h" number="3963">H.R. 3963</bill>, CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12027]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 774 and ask for its immediate consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="774">H. Res. 774</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative> Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the bill (<bill type="h" number="3963">H.R. 3963</bill>) to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to extend and improve the Children's Health Insurance Program, and for other purposes. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived except those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI. The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions of the bill are waived. The previous question  shall be considered as ordered on the bill to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided among and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means; and (2) one motion to recommit.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Sec. 2.  During consideration of <bill type="h" number="3963">H.R. 3963</bill> pursuant to this resolution, notwithstanding the operation of the previous question, the Chair may postpone further consideration of the bill to such time as may be designated by the Speaker.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;POINT OF ORDER</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400367" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I raise a point of order against consideration of the rule because the rule contains a waiver of all points of order against the bill and its consideration and, therefore, is in violation of section 426 of the Congressional Budget Act.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Texas makes a point of order that the resolution violates section 426(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.</chair>
  <chair>In accordance with section 426(b)(2) of the Act, the gentleman has met the threshold burden to identify the specific language in the resolution on which the point of order is predicated.</chair>
  <chair>Under section 426(b)(4) of the Act, the gentleman from Texas and the gentlewoman from New York each will control 10 minutes of debate on the question of consideration.</chair>
  <chair>Pursuant to section 426(b)(3) of the Act, after the debate the Chair will put the question of consideration, to wit: "Will the House now consider the resolution?"</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400367" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we make a point of order with great respect to this body. We're here to do business today. We've asked this body to please consider an adjournment because we have a lot of Members who are in California. We were denied that request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also believe this point of order should be heard because it's important that last night a 293-page bill was brought forth to the Rules Committee, which we received only 25 to 30 minutes before that meeting took place, I believe, in violation of the regular order for legislation that Speaker Pelosi has outlined for all Members of Congress, as well as the American people, a Congress working for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And under regular order for legislation, it states: "Members should have at least 24 hours to examine bill and conference report text prior to floor consideration." Mr. Speaker, that has not happened again today. Again today we find that the legislation not following regular order is presented to this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night, as we began the discussion in the Rules Committee, we found out this is not even a House bill. No  one took responsibility for the bill that was coming to the Rules Committee last night. Every person there said this is a Senate bill; this isn't a House bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then we tried to discuss what was in that bill. I don't know what's in that bill. Sure, we've had some time today, but we have not digested all 293 pages. And, Mr. Speaker, we believe that what is happening here today is not only in violation of what we have seen, a Congress working for all Americans, but also the establishment of the way this House would run itself under regular order and for the best interest of all Members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400367" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in support of his point of order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see that the distinguished Speaker of the House is on the floor, was on the floor; and although I don't have the quote in front of me, I know, as she took the gavel to become Speaker of the House, that she said that this would be something along the lines of the fairest and most democratically run House in the history of our country. I'm trying to see where the fairness, I'm trying to see where the democracy comes in, where most of us, most of us didn't even know of the existence of this almost-300-page  bill until we arrived this morning. And so I'm having a little trouble seeing exactly where we're having fairness and democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, Mr. Speaker, I think Speaker Pelosi said bills should generally come to the floor under procedure that allows open, full, and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members should have at least 24 hours to examine the bill. That is certainly not true for this Member. I don't think it's true for the vast majority of Members here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the Speaker may say one thing, and I respect her words, but the actions are speaking far more loudly than the words are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would think, with the great human tragedy that is taking place in California unfolding upon the television screens of almost everyone in America, I would think that if any Speaker would be sensitive to that human tragedy it would be this Speaker since she hails from the State of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet we have countless Members who need to return home to be about the business of their constituents, and they're not here. They're not present for a very, very important vote and a vote that could have obviously taken place months ago, a vote that could have taken place weeks ago, and a vote that can take place early next week when these people will return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yet, I fear, I'm not questioning the motives or the heart of any one Member, but the actions are such that people could be led to believe that this is simply a move to manipulate the outcome of a vote. And I'm not sure that's the appearance that we want to give the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, again, Republicans, Members on this side of the aisle, have stood ready for weeks and for months to reauthorize an SCHIP program. The vast majority will vote to support funding for every eligible child. But a program that was designed and passed by a Republican House to ensure health insurance benefits for uninsured low-income American children, that's been hijacked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And again, yet again, the Democrat Congress will try to transform that program into something else; instead to give additional benefits to adults while we still have children that are not served, to give benefits to illegal immigrants while we still have Americans unserved, to give benefits to the uninsured while we have those who are insured and, finally, to give benefits to higher-income Americans before we serve lower-income Americans. That is not right. This is not fair. This is not democratic.  It's not what the Speaker committed to. And this point of order should be sustained.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400367" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last Congress the distinguished chairwoman of the Committee on Rules thought it was so important to require at least 24 hours before voting on any rule that she authored a rules change, <bill type="hr" number="686">H. Res. 686</bill>, cosponsored by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui), senior members of the Rules Committee. The proposed change would have prohibited calling  up a report by the Committee on Rules within 24 hours of presentation to the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would refer my colleagues to <bill type="hr" number="686">H. Res. 686</bill> of the 109th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I wasn't really surprised when the new Democrat majority didn't actually follow through on their commitments on the opening-day package. However, I just wonder what happened to the dedication of Democratic Members who once showed the rights of preserving those things which they think are good for Members to have time to know what the heck they're voting on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And I believe today a 293-page bill with zero cosponsors, and even the gentleman who brought the bill to the Rules Committee last night said "not my bill, it's the Senate's bill," I believe we should be careful what we are doing and allow 24 hours and follow the rules of the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from California (Mr. Daniel E. Lungren).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from California is recognized for 2 1/2  minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this point of order that goes essentially to the question of unfunded mandates contained in this bill. It is very difficult to determine exactly what this bill is since it is nearly 300 pages and we received it last night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is the question of unfunded mandates so important? Well, a great example would be exactly what is happening in my home State of California right now; the tremendous, tremendous pressure that my home State is under at the current time as a result of an unprecedented series of fires raging at the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that brings into question of those Members of Congress from my home State who are traveling today back home with the President of the United States in order to assess the damage, to show that the Federal Government is fully involved in concert with State and local governments. And we would ask that the consideration of this rule and this bill be postponed not only on this point of order but because of the circumstances that are occurring in our State at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority leader said a little bit earlier that, well, things happen all the time and Members miss the opportunity to be here on the floor because they are back home, as if this is an everyday occurrence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home State has lost almost 1,500 residences, 1,500 destroyed. We have somewhere between half a million and a million people evacuated. That is not an everyday occurrence. That is an exceptional circumstance. And it just is beyond the sense of the cordial nature of the collegiality of this House that ought to prevail for us to be considering this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 9,000 firefighters from all agencies on the fire lines of California over the last number of days. At least one confirmed death, 18 fires in seven counties, almost a half a million acres destroyed, 104 commercial structures destroyed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is that we ought to come together and work together on issues as important as responding to the natural disaster that is occurring in California just as we should be coming together, working together to try to solve the problem of the unmet needs of poor children and their health in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have not been invited to the table to be able to present this. This point of order ought to be sustained technically on the question of unfunded mandates but really, philosophically on the fact that this is not the time for consideration of this particular rule or this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I feel compelled to point out this is not  about a point of order or unfunded mandates, but it is because this administration and many of the people in this House do not want to give health care to 10 million children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> All time for debate has expired. The question is: Shall the House now consider the resolution?</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.</paragraph>
