  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill>) to designate the headquarters building of the Department of Education in Washington, DC, as the Lyndon Baines Johnson Federal Building, as amended.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Graves) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on <bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Congressman Gene Green of Texas for his steadfast advocacy to this bill. In the 109th Congress, he introduced <bill type="h" number="4252">H.R. 4252</bill>, a bill to designate the Department of Education headquarters building. Lyndon Baines Johnson, "the teacher who became President," was one of the leading political figures of the 20th century, I think, on both sides of the aisle, it would be agreed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He served the country in ways too numerous to mention, including lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Member of both Houses of Congress, Vice President of the United States and, of course, the 36th President of the United States, we are all aware of President Johnson's humble beginnings in Stonewall, Texas. In 1927, he enrolled in Southwest Texas State Teachers College at San Marcos, Texas, now the Texas State University at San Marcos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He graduated with a bachelor of science degree in August 1930. After graduation, he taught at Pearsall High School in Pearsall, Texas, and taught public speaking at Sam Houston High School in Houston, Texas. In a special election in 1937, President Johnson won the U.S. House of Representatives seat representing the 10th Congressional District of Texas, defeating nine other candidates. In the next election he was elected to a full term in the 76th Congress and to each succeeding Congress until  1948.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 1941, President Johnson became the first Member of Congress to volunteer for active duty in the Armed Forces, enlisting in the U.S. Navy, reporting for active duty on December 9, 1941.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson received the Silver Star for gallantry from General Douglas MacArthur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1948, he campaigned for and was elected to the U.S. Senate. He was elected minority leader of the Senate in 1953 and majority leader in 1955, where he served until January 1961, when he resigned to become Vice President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lyndon Johnson became the 36th President of the United States on November 22, 1963, after the tragic assassination of President John F. Kennedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his administration, education was one of the many areas where Johnson blazed new ground. He pursued numerous education initiatives and signed many landmark education bills into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1963, President Johnson approved the Higher Education Facilities Act, which authorized a 5-year program of Federal grants and loans for construction for improvement of public and private higher education facilities in 1964. President Johnson signed the Library Services Act in order to make high-quality public libraries more accessible to both urban and rural residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later that year, President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, which, among its provisions, authorized the Federal authorities to sue for the segregation of schools and to withhold Federal funds from education institutions that practiced segregation, if I may say so. The bill also authorized title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the equal employment part of the act it was my great privilege to enforce as Chair of the EEOC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1965, President Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Act. This was the first general aid-to-education program ever adopted, and it provided programs to help educate disadvantaged children in urban and rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later that year, he also signed the Higher Education Act, which was the first U.S. congressional approval for scholarships to undergraduate students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1965 as well, President Johnson launched Project Head Start as an 8-week summer program to help break the cycle of poverty by providing preschool children of low-income families with a comprehensive program to meet their emotional, social, health, nutritional, and psychological needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1966, President Johnson signed the International Education Act, which promoted international studies at United States colleges and universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1968, he signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act amendments of 1967, establishing bilingual education programs for non-English speaking children and providing more funds for special education for handicapped education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later that year, he also signed the Handicapped Children's Early Education Assistance Act, which authorized experimental programs for handicapped children of preschool age. After leaving office, President Johnson continued his involvement in education and taught students while he wrote his memoirs and pursued other academic endeavors. President Johnson died January 22, 1973.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lyndon Baines Johnson will be remembered not only as a great President and Member of the House and of the Senate, but also as a champion of education. Thus, the Department of Education, located at 400 Maryland Avenue, Southwest, Washington, D.C., most appropriately should bear the name of and be designated as the Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill> designates the Department of Education Building as the Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building. Lyndon Baines Johnson was born in Stonewall, Texas, on August 27, 1908, and his connection to education began very early in life when at the age of 4 his mother persuaded the teacher at the nearby one-room junction school to take him as a student.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lyndon Baines Johnson enrolled in the Southwest Texas State Teachers College in 1927. He graduated in 1930 and embarked on a teaching career that would eventually lead him to the White House. As was pointed out by the gentlelady, in 1937 he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in a special election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was subsequently re-elected to the House in each succeeding Congress until 1948 when he was elected to the United States Senate. In 1961, he resigned from the Senate to become the 37th Vice President; and on November 22, 1963, a day we all remember, Lyndon Baines Johnson became the 36th President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This teacher who would become President pursued numerous education initiatives, as was pointed out. He signed into law education legislation such as the Higher Education Facilities Act, the Library Services Act, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and the Higher Education Act, just to name a few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After leaving office, President Johnson continued to have an impact on education, as he taught students while he was writing his memoirs, and subsequently passed away on January 22, 1973.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to recognize the gentleman from South Carolina for such time as he may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400075" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a former public school teacher who started his educational pursuits as a 4-year-old in his mother's kindergarten, I proudly rise in support of <bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill>, legislation to designate the headquarters building of the Department of Education here in Washington as the Lyndon Baines Johnson Federal Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, most people remember President Johnson for his poise and confidence as he assumed the Presidency during a turbulent and mournful time for our Nation. He is also remembered for his leadership and vision with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was his support in the White House for a movement that I and my brothers and sisters were fighting for on buses and at lunch counters throughout the South and helped bring here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I give special thanks to his work in an area that is dear to my heart, education. President Johnson recognized the power of education to  strengthen the Nation and help bring people out of poverty. He made his name as the first education President by signing into law over 60 education bills during his Presidency, most notably the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and the Higher Education Act of 1965.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was the first President to recognize the need for strong Federal investment in education, backing programs that funded not only elementary and secondary education, but higher education with the Federal student loan program for college and graduate school students. He gave us the Head Start Program, which since its inception has helped millions of disadvantaged children get off on the right foot by providing health, nutritional and educational assistance, recognizing that an investment in our  children at an early age pays off in the long run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His domestic vision for this country was revolutionary in the areas of civil rights and the fighting of poverty. We still see the benefits of his vision for a Great Society today. That is why I am proud to join my colleagues in passing this legislation to designate the Department of Education, the first Federal building in Washington to bear his name. I thank the gentlelady for yielding me this time, and I thank her for her leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>

  <speaking speaker="400158" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I wish to yield 6 minutes to the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank Congressman Graves for his gracious allocation of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support for <bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill>, a bill to name the Department of Education headquarters in Washington, D.C., as the Lyndon Baines Johnson Federal Building. I am proud to be the primary Republican sponsor of this legislation, and I believe that all the Republicans in the Texas delegation have also cosponsored this particular piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Mr. Green of Texas for being the primary sponsor of the overall bill and his tireless work on this. He has worked on it for a number of years now, and it is good to see that it has finally come to fruition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I never had the privilege to meet the late President Lyndon Baines Johnson. I wish I had. I am a great admirer of his in many ways, not so much some of the policies that he pursued, but I am a great admirer of the enthusiasm and the tenacity with which he pursued those policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my first campaign for Congress in 1984, I read the first Caro book, "Path to Power," the first installment of that, and required all my campaign staff to read that book; because President Johnson, when he ran for Congress in the 1930s in the middle of the Depression, he made it a motto of his that he would literally search out the voters of his congressional district one by one, whether they were in the fields plowing or in the stores working or at church socials or wherever. He went where  the people were to spread his message.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I took that to heart, and numerous times traveled hundreds of miles to meet with small groups and in a few cases one or two people just so I could have an option. On one occasion, I went and met with a gentleman at 6 a.m. because he didn't think I would show up at 6 a.m., and so he said meet him at 6 a.m. when he opened his business. And I was there at 5:45. On another occasion, a banker in Houston couldn't see me. I waited in his waiting room from 4 o'clock in the afternoon until 8:30 that  evening, and finally, in exasperation, he agreed to see me and, before I left, had given me a substantial contribution and agreed to let me use his name on my steering committee. Those were both things that I got from the way President Johnson ran his campaign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In terms of his policies, the two bills that he supported that became law that had the greatest impact on my life were the creation of the White House Fellows program in 1965. I was a White House Fellow in 1981 and 1982. That is a program that President Johnson established to bring young Americans to Washington for a year to work in the Cabinet agencies, and then either go back to their areas or to stay in Washington. And so far, there have been about, I believe, 700 young Americans have gone  through that program. Texans like Henry Cisneros come to mind, a former White House Fellow. Colin Powell is a former White House Fellow, Senator Sam Brownback in the other body is a former White House Fellow. But it had a tremendous impact on my life and led me for the first time to think about trying to become a Member of this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another program that President Johnson established was the Head Start program. And in the summer I believe of 1964 or 1965, when that program was established in Waco, Texas, my mother became a Head Start assistant at Brooke Avenue Elementary School in Waco, Texas, at a time when my family was in need of financial income, and so she decided to work part time outside the home and went to work at a Head Start program; and, because of that, became a school secretary and spent her career in education.  The impact on me that summer was, I was the oldest child, and it forced me to learn to cook, learn to clean and learn to take care of my three younger brothers and sisters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will never forget the day that my father showed up for lunch and I had been trying to make gravy. To this day, that gravy is still in the pan because it would not come out of the pan when you turned it upside down. That was my one and only attempt to learn how to make gravy. And my father said, "From now on, son, if you need to make gravy, ask your mother to do it or ask me to do it, but nobody can eat what you are trying to make." So thanks to President Johnson, I never had to learn to cook,  because that was one of the few times I even attempted it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I rise in strong support of this piece of legislation. President Johnson was a great President, he was a great American, and he was obviously a great Texan. And there are still people in Washington today that are effective in the political arena. People that come to mind that are still active in Washington, Jack Valenti who was for many years the president of the Motion Picture Association of America who came to Washington with President Johnson, and an attorney named Harry McPherson who is  still active in his practice, he, too, was involved with the President. Some of the former members of this body, the late Jake Pickle, the late Jack Brooks, were LBJ proteges. And then former Governor of Texas, John Connelly, a good friend of mine who helped me politically when I was getting started, is another protege of Lyndon Johnson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill with Congressman Green. I think it is right to honor President Johnson with this building. He wanted to be known as the "educational president" and did many, many things to bring forth public education for our citizens.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, the author of the bill, such time as he may require.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400160" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as author and sponsor of the bill, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill>. I would like to thank both Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Norton and Ranking Member Mica and Ranking Member Graves for moving this legislation out of committee, and I like to thank Majority Leader Hoyer for bringing it to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A bipartisan group of Texas delegation members introduced this bill to name the Department of Education headquarters building in Washington, D.C. the Lyndon Baines Johnson Federal Building. We now have over 50 cosponsors from around the country, and I am proud to be joined on this legislation by the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, JOE BARTON, who just spoke, Congressman Mike McCaul, and also our dean of the Texas delegation, Congressman SOLOMON ORTIZ.  Representative McCaul actually represents the Johnson family in Congress. Their bipartisan efforts have helped move this bill to the floor, and I think they should be congratulated for the efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say one thing, though. Former Congressman Jack Brooks is not deceased. He is still much alive, and Congressman Barton, I suspect you will be getting a call very shortly from Jack Brooks, as we all know, former dean of the Texas delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did have the opportunity at a very young age to meet President Johnson. In January 1973, I was a young State Representative in Austin, Texas, my first term. President Johnson came to our swearing in my first term in 1973, and I actually got a very candid photo with him that I hang proudly in our office here in Washington. He passed away a week later, and I was honored to be able to go to his funeral and his burial there at the Johnson Ranch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson was a proud Texan, and back in those days, many of my Republican friends were Democrats as well. President Johnson pioneered issues such as civil rights and voting rights, but his educational leadership stands out even among these accomplishments. President Johnson passed away over 30 years ago, and to this day, he has no Federal buildings in his name in the Capitol area. So we believe the Education Building is a fitting honor. Presidents Reagan and Bush have been honored with  the International Trade Center for President Reagan and the Central Intelligence Agency building for President Bush reflecting their priorities and contributions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson presided during turbulent times in our Nation's history. He ascended to the presidency after the Kennedy assassination and faced a difficult conflict in Southeast Asia. President Johnson was a very human figure, but his legacy is with us in many ways today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lyndon Johnson's first priority in life was education. He was the first "Education President." Before Johnson, educational opportunity in America was not a national priority, as it continues to be today for both our parties, including current President George W. Bush.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1927, Lyndon Baines Johnson's career and education began when he went to Southwest Texas State Teachers College in San Marcos, Texas. He earned money as a janitor and taught the fifth, sixth, and seventh grades at the Mexican-American School in the South Texas town of Cotulla. He taught later at Sam Houston High School, which is part of our congressional district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Jeff Davis High School student, which Madam Speaker, you actually visited a few years ago, in 1965 and 1966, I saw the impact of the first Federal dollars that came to my high school firsthand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his memoirs, President Johnson declared, "There is an old saying that kids is where the money ain't." And I need to repeat that. That may be true today, Madam Speaker, "That kids is where the money ain't, which summed up one of the major problems confronting the American educational system when I became President." And that is a direct quote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Continuing the quote, "because of these convictions, I made a personal decision during the 1964 Presidential campaign to make education a fundamental issue and to put it high on the Nation's agenda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I proposed to act on my belief that, regardless of a family's financial condition, education should be available to every child in the United States, as much education as he or she could absorb. I had no intention of walking away from this fight."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson succeeded in his fight to improve education for all Americans. He signed into law 60 education bills, including the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, which established the Head Start program, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the Higher Education Act of 1965.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Elementary and Secondary Education Act was the first real Federal assistance to grade school education, and it is widely supported today. The President actually signed that in a one-room schoolhouse in Stonewall, Texas, with his elementary school teacher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In large part, President Johnson's education priorities are accepted by both political parties, as some of them were then. The Higher Education Act passed by 368-22 in the House and 79-3 in the Senate, strong bipartisanship votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In discussing President Johnson's education legacy, we have to recognize First Lady, Lady Bird Johnson, who was also a major contributor and strong advocate for his educational initiatives. During her White House years, Ms. Johnson served as honorary chair of the National Head Start program, the program for underprivileged school children which prepares them to take their places in the classroom on par with their peers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In part for her education efforts, President Ford presented her with the country's highest civilian award, the Medal of Freedom. Mrs. Johnson turned 94 last December, and hopefully she is listening to this debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Johnson also received the Congressional Gold Medal from President Reagan in 1988. This legislation is a fitting honor for both President Lyndon Baines Johnson and also First Lady, Lady Bird Johnson.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400158" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 7 minutes to another gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400654" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleague from Texas, Mr. Green, for introducing this bill. It has been a real honor to work with you on this bill. I am proud to be a lead sponsor and to have played a role in terms of whipping votes on my side of the aisle and getting this bill to the floor of the House where it stands today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this important piece of legislation which honors a former President of the United States and his commitment to better educate the future generations of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we will vote to name the Department of Education building in Washington, D.C., the Lyndon Baines Johnson Federal Building. And, by doing so, we honor a son of Texas who left a positive mark on me, my family, the State of Texas, and this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born on August 27, 1908, in Stonewall, Texas, Lyndon Johnson's family knew that he was destined to do great things. The future President got his experience in Washington first as a secretary to Congressman Richard Kleburg. Shortly after that, Johnson met Claudia Alta Taylor, a woman the world has come to affectionately know as Lady Bird.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1937, after the death of Congressman James Buchanan, Lyndon Johnson entered a special election for the 10th Congressional District of Texas, a district which I am proud to represent today. Representative Johnson beat nine other candidates to win the seat, an experience that I can personally relate to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his tour of duty during World War II, LBJ would spend the next 23 years in the Congress as both a Congressman and Senator. During his career in the Congress, Johnson would serve as Senate minority and Senate majority leader. As President Kennedy's Vice President, Johnson served as the chairman of NASA and the Presidential Space Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lyndon Johnson early on earned a reputation for getting things done for the betterment of our Nation, and he used that intensity to lead America to land a man on the moon and continue America's dominance in space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>But it was Lyndon Johnson's steady and calming leadership after the assassination of President Kennedy which helped to lead our Nation through one of its most turbulent and tragic hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Taking the experience he had gained from his younger days as a teacher, President Johnson focused on working with the Congress and passing several landmark education bills. These initiatives served as a foundation for a new standard of education in America. Among them were programs such as Head Start, the first Federal aid to public schools and the first Federal student loan programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson recorded in his memoirs, he said, "I remember seeing in the folder of reading material I took to my bedroom one night, the account of a 62-year old man who learned how to write his name after years of making an X for his signature. He was so excited that he sat for a whole hour just writing his name over and over again."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Johnson said, "Reading about this man whose life had been so enriched, I was almost as excited as the man himself."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, that sums up so much of the man President Johnson was. In his story, our striving for increased opportunity and education took shape and became real and valid. It is this love and dedication to education that makes this bill the ideal way, in my view, and my judgment, to honor President' Johnson's memory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While President Johnson will always be remembered as a champion of the  Civil Rights Act, it was President Johnson's wish that the education papers from his Presidency be the first set of records to be made public because he believed, and I quote, in his words, "You can't get your civil rights without your education." This is why, in my judgment, he will always be known as the first "Education President."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the greatest honors I have had during my tenure in the Congress was the opportunity to sit down with Lady Bird Johnson, who I am proud to have as a friend and a constituent. I spoke with her about my intention to see this bill through the Congress and have the Department of Education named for her husband. And the excitement and the gratitude in her eyes that she responded with will be a memory that I will cherish for the rest of my life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Representative of President Johnson's former congressional district, I have been inspired by his dedication to the American people. I specifically look back to his work in supporting the space program and education as I consider ways to further improve our great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I urge my colleagues to honor this great Texan and to support the Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God bless Lyndon Johnson, and may God bless our national treasure, Lady Bird, may God bless Texas, and may God bless the United States of America.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400111" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today, we belatedly honor the Education President by affixing his name to the Education Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson began as student Johnson, a Blanco County farm boy going to college in Hays County, Texas, at Southwest Texas State Teachers College. It was a time when he remarked that "poverty was so common we didn't even have a name for it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He borrowed $75 to get his college education, which is one of the reasons he appreciated the need for strong student financial assistance programs. And he even took leave there at Southwest Texas, as it later became known, in order to teach school and earn a little money to stay in school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, we dedicated an LBJ museum in San Marcos to commemorate his years as a student there, recognizing that now Texas State University continues to provide quality higher education to students across the State, Nation and globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson continued his involvement as President with students. One of my own most memorable experiences as a university student was going with a small delegation of university student leaders to meet with President Johnson in the residence at the White House and having an opportunity to ask him questions about the important work that he was doing in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1994, I had the good fortune to be elected to represent the congressional district that Lyndon Johnson once served in this House, having served in the State Senate before that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With his own premature passing, we lost the opportunity to have his continued involvement in Texas, but we have been blessed, as other speakers have noted, with the active involvement of the woman we know only as "Lady Bird," who continues now, even at this point in her life, to make public appearances and support causes for education and other good deeds in the Central Texas area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, we are blessed that his commitment to education is reflected in the work of his daughter, Luci Baines Johnson Turpin, and his granddaughter, Catherine Robb, who are active participants in our Central Texas community. This family recognized that, as President Johnson said of the NATO alliance many years ago, "There are no problems we cannot solve together, and very few we can solve by ourselves."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The importance of working together is true, whether our objective is to provide more children an education, guarantee seniors' retirement security or protect our veterans with the coverage that they earned and deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we name this building to honor President Johnson, I think that we share his commitment to the least, the last, and the most in need. All of us welcome this measure as a fitting tribute to a man who did so much for this country, so much for education, and so much to improve the quality of life for all Americans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to another gentleman from Texas (Mr. Rodriguez).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400339" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a proud Texan, I rise this afternoon in support of <bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill> in naming the Department of Education Headquarters Building in Washington, D.C. after the first "Education President," President Lyndon B Johnson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like myself, President Johnson began his career in the field of education and, like me, he also had to borrow money in order to attend college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1927, he borrowed $75, as indicated by the previous speaker, to attend the Southwest Texas State Teachers College in San Marcos, Texas. He temporarily dropped out of school to serve also as a principal and teacher, and he taught at a school in South Texas in La Salle County in a city by the name of Cotulla, which is a city that I had the pleasure of representing while I was representing the 28th Congressional District. There he taught a good number of Mexican Americans as a young man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 19, 1930, President Johnson graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Science and continued teaching at Pearsall High School, also in the 28th Congressional District that I served.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pioneering the importance of education as our President, on April 11, 1965, Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which was the first Federal general aid to education law and focused on disadvantaged children, both in inner cities and rural communities throughout this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, President Johnson has no Federal buildings in the District of Columbia named after him, and since he enacted over 60 education bills in his term, including the Economic Opportunity Act, Head Start, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (title I) and the Higher Education Act, (beginning student loan program), the Department of Education building is a fitting honor for President LBJ.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues in joining me in passing <bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Lampson).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400229" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding me the time, and our Republican colleagues for the graciousness in extending our time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first met Lyndon Baines Johnson when he was a Senator from Texas and he came to my high school and showed the commitment that he had to education and to inspiring young people to go into public service. I was one of those young people who responded to his words at that time. And I am privileged today to represent the area where the Lyndon Baines Johnson Space Center, the Johnson Space Center, is located in Texas, and it continues to be a beacon to inspire young people to enter into, particularly  math and science education, critical areas that we need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I am also privileged to speak today in support of this piece of legislation, <bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill>, a bill to name the Department of Education's Washington headquarters in honor of one of our Nation's greatest Presidents, President Lyndon Baines Johnson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Texan, it gives me particular pride to help this effort to name the building after a man who did so much to enhance and improve the educational system for all Americans. Not only did he begin his storied career in public service as an educator, as I did, and some of my colleagues who have  already spoken, President Johnson also ushered in the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and the Higher Education  Act of 1965, all keystones in our efforts to provide excellent and enduring educational opportunities for all of our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House should take this simple step to honor a great leader and educator and, of course, a great Texan. It is a fitting tribute to his family that remains, including Lady Bird. I ask for the support of all Members of this piece of legislation, <bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, may I ask Mr. Graves, the gentleman from Missouri, whether he has any more speakers and if he is prepared to yield back his time?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I have none. I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman again for his courtesy in allowing a number of Members to speak with the time he provided.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, before I yield back the remainder of our time, I must say that it would be hard to find a greater domestic policy President than Lyndon Baines Johnson. The only one I could think of would be FDR himself, and of course, President Johnson updated the Roosevelt New Deal. In fact, we are naming the education building, the Department of Education building after President Johnson. We could as soon have named the HHS building. This is the Medicare President. This is the Medicaid President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On both sides of the aisle, the historic accomplishments of this great President have been embraced. And I must tell you, they have certainly been embraced by our constituents. He updated the New Deal. And as we consider what domestic legislation lies ahead for us, I think we would do well to remember that history gets made in one era; and the New Deal era with Social Security, unemployment insurance and the like, and then in another era, new issues come forward. President Johnson found those  issues. None could have been more important than education and health care, and I appreciate the bipartisan nature of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No building should be named in Washington that is not embraced on both sides of the aisle, and there is no more appropriate person to name this building after than President Lyndon Baines Johnson.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill>, a bill to designate the Department of Education headquarters building located at 400 Maryland Avenue Southwest in the District of Columbia as the "Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the gentleman from Texas, Mr. GREEN, and his colleagues of the Texas delegation, for their steadfast advocacy for this bill. In the 109th Congress, Mr. GREEN introduced a similar bill, <bill type="h" number="4252">H.R. 4252</bill>. Regrettably, the House did not take action on that legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lyndon Baines Johnson, "the Teacher who became President," was one of the leading political figures of the 20th century. He served his country in ways too numerous to detail, including as lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Member of both houses of Congress, Vice President of the United States, and the 36th President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson was born on August 27, 1908, in Stonewall, TX. In 1927, he enrolled in Southwest Texas State Teachers College at San Marcos, TX--Texas State University--San Marcos. He took a leave of absence for a year to serve as principal and teach fifth, sixth, and seventh grades at Welhausen School, a school in the south Texas town of Cotulla. He graduated with a bachelor of science degree in August 1930. After graduation, he taught at Pearsall High School in Pearsall, TX, and taught public  speaking at Sam Houston High School in Houston, TX.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a special election in 1937, Johnson won the U.S. House of Representatives seat representing the 10th Congressional District of Texas, defeating nine other candidates. In the next election, he was re-elected to a full term in the 76th Congress and to each succeeding Congress until 1948.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Johnson became the first Member of Congress to volunteer for active duty in the Armed Forces--U.S. Navy, reporting for active duty on December 9, 1941. Johnson received the Silver Star from GEN Douglas MacArthur for gallantry in action during an aerial combat mission over hostile positions in New Guinea on June 9, 1942. President Roosevelt ordered all Members of Congress in the Armed Forces to return to their offices, and Johnson was released  from active duty on July 16, 1942.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1948, he campaigned for and was elected to the U.S. Senate. He was elected minority leader of the Senate in 1953 and majority leader in 1955, where he served until January 1961, when he resigned to become Vice President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lyndon Johnson became the 36th President of the United States on November 22, 1963, after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During President Johnson's administration, education was one of the many areas where Johnson blazed new ground. He pursued numerous education initiatives, and signed many landmark education bills into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1963, President Johnson approved the Higher Education Facilities Act--P.L. 88-204--which authorized a 5-year program of Federal grants and loans for construction or improvement of public and private higher education academic facilities. This legislation created the largest education program since enactment of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>the National Defense Education Act of 1958, and it was the first comprehensive education bill enacted in the post-World War II period that was not tied to national defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1964, President Johnson signed the Library Services Act--P.L. 88-269--to make high quality public libraries more accessible to both urban and rural residents. The funds made available under this act were used to construct as well as operate libraries, and to extend this program to cities as well as rural areas. Later that year, President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act--P.L. 88-352--which, among its landmark provisions, authorized Federal authorities to sue for the desegregation of schools  and to withhold Federal funds from education institutions that practiced segregation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1965, President Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Act--P.L. 89-10. This legislation was the first general aid-to-education program ever adopted by Congress, and it provided programs to help educate disadvantaged children in urban and rural areas. Later that year, he also signed the Higher Education Act--P.L. 89-329, which was the first program approved by Congress for scholarships to undergraduate students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson launched Project Head Start, as an 8-week summer program in 1965, to help break the cycle of poverty by providing pre-school children of low-income families with a comprehensive program to meet their emotional, social, health, nutritional, and psychological needs. Recruiting children ages three to school-entry age, Head Start was enthusiastically received by education and child development specialists, community leaders, and parents across the Nation. Currently, Head Start continues  to serve children and their families each year in urban and rural areas in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. territories, including many American Indian and migrant children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1966, President Johnson signed the International Education Act--P.L. 89-698, which promoted international studies at U.S. colleges and universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1968, he signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Amendments of 1967--P.L. 90-247, establishing bilingual education programs for non-English speaking children, and providing more funds for special education for disabled children. Later that year, President Johnson also signed the Handicapped Children's Early Education Assistance Act--P.L. 90-538, which authorized experimental programs for disabled children of pre-school age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After leaving office, Lyndon Baines Johnson continued his involvement in education and taught students while he wrote his memoirs and pursued other academic endeavors. Lyndon Johnson died January 22, 1973.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lyndon Baines Johnson will be remembered not only as a great President and Member of Congress, but also as a champion for education. Thus, it is very appropriate that the headquarters building of the Department of Education, located at 400 Maryland Avenue Southwest in the District of Columbia, be designated as the "Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today I join Congressman GENE GREEN and a bipartisan group of the Texas delegation in supporting the renaming of the Department of Education headquarters building to the "Lyndon Baines Johnson Federal Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a fitting tribute to name the building that houses the Department of Education after President Lyndon B. Johnson. Under his watch, over 60 education bills were signed into law, several of which changed the face of education in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One such bill enacted by President Johnson is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. For the first time, Federal funds were explicitly directed to elementary and secondary public schools. These funds have improved the quality of education received by millions of students over the past 42 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson soon followed this measure with the Higher Education Act of 1965. This legislation made a college education possible for millions of Americans by creating the Federal student aid program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 contained the provisions creating the Head Start Program, which has put generations of preschool-age children on the path of learning and success. Head Start gives children the foundation they need in order to be successful in school in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As President Johnson himself once said, "Poverty must not be a bar to learning and learning must offer an escape from poverty." By opening the doors of education to millions of Americans, President Johnson improved countless lives and put the American dream within the reach of many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Congressman GREEN for bringing this bill to the floor so that we all may recognize the contributions of President Johnson to this Nation and to our educational system.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill>, a bill introduced by my friend GENE GREEN of Houston, which names the Department of Education Headquarters Building in Washington, DC, after President Lyndon B. Johnson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson's legacy is vast and mostly underappreciated. He was a visionary in terms of groundbreaking social legislation that literally changed the way this country elected leaders, treated one another in the workplace, and educated our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson passed away over 30 years ago, and is survived by his First Lady, Lady Bird Johnson. Despite the groundbreaking work in education and so many other levels, no Federal buildings bear his name in the national Capital area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In May 1964, Johnson called for a nationwide war against poverty and outlined a vast program of economic and social welfare legislation designed to create what he termed the Great Society. Central to his vision of a nation no longer hindered by poverty and hate was an education for every child, no matter what their economic status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his time in office, President Johnson passed over 60 education bills, including the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the Higher Education Act of 1965, and created the Head Start Program. Taken together, these legislative feats form the basis of public education in the United States today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson grew up in San Marcos, TX, seeing abject poverty all around him and seeing the power scheme that separated white children from Hispanic and African-American children. From his earliest days, he concluded the only true equalizing influence in our Nation was through an equal education for all Americans, no matter what their skin color or their economic status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Education headquarters building on Maryland Avenue, SW., in Washington, DC, has no name on it today. Bearing the name of our 36th President would be a fitting tribute to the life and legislative accomplishments in education of the Johnson presidency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While novel in his day, the Johnson administration's policy to place a national priority on education is supported by large majorities of both parties today, illustrating the long-term righteousness of Johnson's cause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Truly, the only silver bullet to equalize people in this Nation is education. That was LBJ's vision, and perfecting that vision should be our duty in the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Texas for his work in bringing this bill to the floor today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill>, a bill to name the headquarters of the United States Department of Education after President Lyndon B. Johnson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the entire District of Columbia, with all its Federal buildings, parks and monuments, there is not a single Federal facility named after the man many historians call one of the best Presidents in American history. From his stewardship of legislation creating Medicare and Medicaid, to his passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, President Johnson left a legacy on this Nation that we still enjoy today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his quest to achieve racial equality in the United States, President Johnson was an avid supporter of education. In 1965 he signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act into law. This landmark bill provided significant federal funding to public schools. Also in 1965, he stewarded the Higher Education Act to passage. Thanks to this legislation, children in poverty for the first time were able to attend college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, like President Johnson, I was a public school teacher, and I understand the importance of a good education. Let me conclude by quoting President Johnson himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I shall never forget the faces of the boys and the girls in that little Welhausen Mexican School, and I remember even yet the pain of realizing and knowing then that college was closed to practically every one of those children because they were too poor. And I think it was then that I made up my mind that this Nation could never rest while the door to knowledge remained closed to any American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I can think of no better person after whom we should name the building of the Department of Education. I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400179" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in proud support of <bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill>, a bill to re-name the Department of Education Building after a great Texan and a great American, Lyndon Baines Johnson. I would like to thank my good friend and colleague, GENE GREEN for bringing this bill to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we aspire to fulfill the vision of the Great Society that President Johnson envisioned for this Nation--in his words--a place where the meaning of man's life matches the marvels of man's labor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early on in his life, President Johnson was exposed to the unacceptable inequities in our Nation's education system. As a teacher and a principal in Cotula, TX, President Johnson worked with impoverished Hispanic students for whom the dream of pursuing higher education was all but out of reach. He saw a nation failing to live up to its potential because it failed to develop the talents of its low-income and minority citizens. He vowed not to rest until America's opportunities were open and accessible  to everyone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a fitting tribute to name the Department of Education headquarters after the President who brought us the Head Start Program, the Higher Education Act and student financial aid, as well as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which today we know as the No Child Left Behind Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under his watch, our Nation made a commitment to education so that opportunity and success would no longer be determined by family wealth or the color of one's skin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson was a visionary and a patriot. For me, a member of the Education and Labor Committee, he was a hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all my colleges to support <bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill>, legislation to designate the Department of Education headquarters in Washington, DC, after our 36th President, Lyndon Baines Johnson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An elementary school teacher himself, President Johnson had a deep appreciation for the importance of education. In his "Great Society" speech at the University of Michigan in 1964, President Johnson stated:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must seek an educational system which grows in excellence as it grows in size. This means better training for our teachers. It means preparing youth to enjoy their hours of leisure as well as their hours of labor. It means exploring new techniques of teaching, to find new ways to stimulate the love of learning and the capacity for creation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson's statement rings true to this day. Now is an especially important time to revisit his vision. As the global marketplace becomes more competitive, it is becoming clear that education is the vehicle that will drive U.S. global leadership into the future. It is therefore vital that we renew our commitment to Federal education programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of President Johnson's largest education initiatives were passed in 1965, including the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--ESEA--and the Higher Education Act HEA. ESEA provided the first program ever adopted by Congress to provide Federal support for public schools, and HEA provided the first-ever Federal financial aid programs to help students afford college. In addition, 1965 saw the passage of legislation to create the National Head Start program and the National Endowments for Arts  and Humanities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For over 40 years, President Johnson's education initiatives have helped millions of children across the country achieve the American dream. It is only fitting that the Federal Department of Education building be named after a man who was a pioneer in his endeavors to promote Federal investment in education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation to name the Department of Education Building in honor of President Lyndon B. Johnson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson believed that everyone should have the right to a free and adequate education regardless of their gender, race or economic status. President Johnson fought for opportunity and access for all Americans, and I can truly think of no one better person for whom to name the Department of Education building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson's first job was as a Texas elementary school teacher and principal at a segregated school attended by only Mexican-Americans. He held that experience with him, and continually fought for education and equality for all Americans. President Johnson recognized that education meant opportunity for millions of Americans who would otherwise never be able to achieve the American dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The strides made for educational equality and fairness under the Johnson administration were truly remarkable. Under President Johnson, we adopted many landmark education policies including the Early and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for Humanities, and the Higher Education Act of 1965. Perhaps no other President has ever overseen so many pioneering changes to the way that we educate our Nation's children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I fully support Congressman GENE GREEN's effort to name the U.S. Department of Education building in honor of President Lyndon B. Johnson, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as an original cosponsor and proud Texan, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="584">H.R. 584</bill>, which designates the national headquarters building of the U.S. Department of Education located in the District of Columbia as the Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building. I support this bill because it is a fitting tribute to the greatest "education President" in the history of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no exaggeration to say, Madam Speaker, that Lyndon Baines Johnson's record of extending the benefits of education to all Americans in every region of the country, of every race and gender, irrespective of economic class or family background, remains unsurpassed. Lyndon Johnson recognized that the educated citizenry is a nation's greatest economic asset and most powerful guardian of its political liberties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Lyndon Johnson did more than any single American, living or dead, to make the Federal Government a partner with States and localities in the vitally important work of educating the people of America, from pre-kindergarten to post-graduate school. It makes perfect sense, therefore, to name the headquarters building of the U.S. Department of Education in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Lyndon Baines Johnson was one of the leading figures of the 20th century. This teacher who became a President served his country in numerous, distinguished ways, including as lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy during World War II, as a Member of both Houses of Congress, as Vice President of the United States, and as the 36th President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lyndon Baines Johnson was born on August 27, 1908, in Stonewall, TX. In 1927, he enrolled in Southwest Texas State Teachers College at San Marcos, TX--Texas State University--San Marcos. He took a leave of absence for a year to serve as principal and teach fifth, sixth, and seventh grades at Welhausen School, a Mexican-American school in the south Texas town of Cotulla. He graduated with a bachelor of science degree in August 1930. After graduation he taught at Pearsall High School in Pearsall,  TX, and taught public speaking at Sam Houston High School in Houston, TX. In the spring of 1931, his debate team won the district championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a special election in 1937, Johnson won the U.S. House of Representatives seat representing the 10th Congressional District of Texas, defeating nine other candidates. He was re-elected to a full term in the 76th Congress and to each succeeding Congress until 1948.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Johnson became the first Member of Congress to volunteer for active duty in the Armed Forces--U.S. Navy, reporting for active duty on December 9, 1941. Johnson received the Silver Star from GEN Douglas MacArthur for gallantry in action during an aerial combat mission over hostile positions in New Guinea on June 9, 1942. President Roosevelt ordered all Members of Congress in the Armed Forces to return to their offices, and Johnson was released  from active duty on July 16, 1942.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1948, after a campaign in which he traveled by "newfangled" helicopter all over the State, Johnson won the primary by 87 votes and earned the nickname "Landslide Lyndon," and in the general election was elected to the U.S. Senate. He was elected minority leader of the Senate in 1953 and majority leader in 1955. He served in the U.S. Senate until he resigned to become Vice President in January 1961.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lyndon Johnson became the 36th President of the United States on November 22, 1963, after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his administration, education was one of the many areas where President Johnson blazed new ground. He pursued numerous  education initiatives, and signed many landmark education bills into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1963, President Johnson approved the Higher Education Facilities Act--P.L. 88-204, which authorized a five-year program of Federal grants and loans for construction or improvement of public and private higher education academic facilities. This legislation was the largest education program enacted by Congress since the National Defense Education Act of 1958, and it was the first broad education bill enacted in the post-World War II period that was not tied to national defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1964, Johnson signed the Library Services Act--P.L. 88-269--to make high quality public libraries more accessible to both urban and rural residents. The funds made available under this act were used to construct as well as operate libraries, and to extend this program to cities as well as rural areas. Later that year, President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act--P.L. 88-352, which among its landmark provisions authorized Federal authorities to sue for the desegregation of schools and to  withhold Federal funds from education institutions that practiced segregation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1965, President Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--P.L. 89-10--at the former Junction Elementary School in Stonewall, TX, where he first attended school. Sitting beside him as he signed the bill was his first teacher, Mrs. Kathryn Deadrich Loney. This legislation was the first general aid-to-education program ever adopted by Congress, and it provided programs to help educate disadvantaged children in urban and rural areas. Later that year, he also signed the Higher  Education Act--P.L. 89-329, which was the first program approved by the U.S. Congress for scholarships to undergraduate students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1965, President Johnson launched Project Head Start, as an 8-week summer program, to help break the cycle of poverty by providing pre-school children from low-income families with a comprehensive program to meet their emotional, social, health, nutritional, and psychological needs. Recruiting children from ages three to school-entry age, Head Start was enthusiastically received by education and child development specialists, community leaders, and parents across the Nation. Currently, Head  Start continues to serve children and their families each year in urban and rural areas in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. territories, as well as many migrant children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1966, President Johnson signed the International Education Act--P.L. 89-698, which promoted international studies at U.S. colleges and universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1968, he signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Amendments of 1967--P.L. 90-247, establishing bilingual education programs for non-English speaking children, and providing more funds for special education for disabled children. Later that year, he also signed the Handicapped Children's Early Education Assistance Act--P.L. 90-538, which authorized experimental programs for disabled children of pre-school age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After leaving office, Lyndon Johnson returned to his native Texas and continued his involvement in public education. His presidential papers are housed at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum at the University of Texas, which in 1970 established the Lyndon Baines Johnson School of Public Affairs, The "LBJ School," as is commonly known, pioneered what was then regarded as a novel approach to training for public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The curriculum combined courses in theory with courses that took students into government agencies to work and conduct research; the faculty included academics from various disciplines as well as practitioners from various levels of government; public service programs included an academic publishing program as well as workshops for government officials. This blend of the academic and the practical remains the distinguishing characteristic of the LBJ School and this highly effective approach to  training for public service is today an accepted model for public affairs graduate programs across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Lyndon Baines Johnson, who died January 22, 1973, will be remembered not only as a great President and Member of Congress, but also as the greatest champion of accessible and affordable quality education for all. President Johnson truly understood the importance of leaving no child behind, and he didn't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all these reasons, Madam Speaker, it is most appropriate that the headquarters building of the Department of Education located at 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., in the District of Columbia be designated the "Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building."</paragraph>
