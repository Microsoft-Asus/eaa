    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize Save the Children USA's 75th anniversary. I am proud to say that Save the Children work began in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Today, Save the Children continues to work in 33 different sites in Kentucky rural communities, serving approximately 3,000 children in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program was founded on January 7, 1932, in response to the needs of children and families struggling to survive the Great Depression in the Appalachian mountain region of Harlan County, KY. In 1938 Save the Children launched a Hot School Lunch program for undernourished children in nine States. Later it became one of the models for the national school lunch program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the organization's U.S. programs concentrate on literacy and nutrition programs benefiting over 20,000 children in areas of constant rural poverty in 12 States. Internationally, Save the Children works in more than 50 developing countries helping children by providing food, medical services and shelter to those in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again I congratulate Save the Children USA on their 75th anniversary. I appreciate the dedication of Save the Children to this worthy cause and their hard work is greatly affecting the lives of many people. Everyone involved in this organization is truly an inspiration to all.</paragraph>
