    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6358">H.R. 6358</bill>, the Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation incorporates the bipartisan compromise amendment to <bill type="h" number="5876">H.R. 5876</bill> that this House debated yesterday and supported by a vote of 422 in a recorded vote that was taken on the substitute amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ranking member, Mr. McKeon, and I worked together to develop this compromise legislation because we both agree that children's health and safety should never be a partisan issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Government Accountability Office has found thousands of cases and allegations of child abuse and neglect, stretching back decades, to teen residential programs, including boot camps, wilderness camps, and therapeutic boarding schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Education and Labor Committee has closely reviewed dozens of serious neglect and abuse cases, including cases that resulted in the death of a child. We have heard from parents of  children who died of preventable causes at the hands of untrained, uncaring staff members. We have heard from adults who attended these programs as teens. They too were the victims of physical and emotional abuse and witnessed other children being abused. These abuses have  been allowed to go on because of the weak State and Federal rules governing teen residential programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An 18-month study by the Government Accountability Office showed that State licensing may exclude certain types of teen residential programs and thus place children at higher risk of abuse and neglect. In some States inconsistent licensing enables programs to define themselves out of the licensing altogether. According to GAO, in Texas a program that calls itself a residential treatment center would be required to obtain a license, but if that same program simply called itself a boarding school,  it would not be required to have that license, and that's why this legislation is terribly important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Parents send their children to these programs because they feel they have exhausted their alternatives. Their children may be abusing drugs or alcohol, attempting to run away or physically harm themselves, or otherwise acting out. They turn to these programs because the promise of staff members that will help their children straighten out their lives. And surely there are many cases in which programs do provide families the help they need. These parents are desperate and their children are in  deep trouble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in far too many cases, when parents turn to those programs, they find they are getting conflicted information by people who have conflicts of interest in recommending the care for their children, financial conflicts of interest, ownership issues, and relationship issues that conflict that kind of advice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also know that we see programs that violate the trust that must be established between the parent and these programs and the programs and the children. It's very difficult for these parents to find good programs and to find accurate information, since the reporting requirements are so thin or nonexistent in so many States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish minimum standards for residential programs, and to enforce them. Ultimately, however, the States will have primary responsibility for carrying out the work of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation calls upon the States within 3 years to take up the role of setting standards and enforcing them at all programs, public and private. The Health and Human Services and the State standards would include prohibitions on physical, sexual, and mental abuse of children. The standards would require the programs to provide children with adequate food, water, and medical care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They would require that programs have plans in place to handle medical emergencies. They would also include new training requirements for program staff, including the training on how to identify and report child abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation requires Health and Human Services to set up a toll-free hotline for people to call to report abuse in these programs. It also requires Health and Human Services to create a Web site for information about each program so that parents can look and see if substantiated cases of child abuse or a child fatality has occurred at the program that they are considering for their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the legislation requires programs to disclose to parents the qualifications, roles, and responsibilities of all current staff members, and requires programs to notify parents of substantiated child abuse or violations of health and safety laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we have the responsibility to keep children safe, no matter what setting they are in. Today, we are taking an important step to finally ending the horrific abuses that have gone on in these residential programs for teens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank again Congresswoman McCarthy of New York for all of her help and work on this legislation, and Congressman McKeon for all of his work on this legislation. His suggestions as the bill left the committee made this a better piece of legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to support the bipartisan legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400321" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="6358">H.R. 6358</bill>, the Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens Act. <bill type="h" number="6358">H.R. 6358</bill> puts protections in place to guard against abuse, neglect, and death at residential treatment programs. These residential treatment programs help seriously troubled teens with drug addiction or behavioral or emotional problems. For many parents, they are a last resort when no other treatments or interventions have worked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members on both sides of the aisle share a commitment to protect young people enrolled in residential treatment programs. Even one instance of abuse, neglect, or death is one too many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we are considering today has been developed in an effort to reach a bipartisan consensus. It's important to note that the provisions in the version of this bill that the Education and Labor Committee reported in May have been revised or edited, including the requirement for the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a new bureaucracy to inspect every private residential treatment program in every State, and the requirement creating a new private right of action for lawsuits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation ensures that the standards required in the bill apply to both public and private residential treatment programs. The language also contains strong background check requirements that ensure that before coming into contact with children, potential employees are thoroughly scrutinized with tools, including the National Sex Offender Registry and an FBI fingerprint check.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stopping child abuse is a necessary and essential function of State and local government. It is clear to me that the most effective and appropriate way to protect those enrolled in these programs is to require States to establish a system of standards, licensure, and regulation to ensure that States are working to stop instances of abuse and neglect at residential treatment programs. The Federal role is to ensure that States live up to their vital responsibilities in stopping abuse in these facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this bill, the responsibility for licensing and inspecting these programs rests with the States and is tied to their receipt of funds under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. The role of the Federal Government relates to establishing minimum standards and investigating instances of abuse and neglect upon a referral from a State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think Members on both sides of the aisle can agree that there's still more work to be done. Just yesterday, Congresswoman Bachmann offered a proposal to strengthen parental notification and consent requirements regarding prescription medications given to teens at residential treatment facilities. Hopefully, this important issue will be further addressed as this legislation moves through the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, it's important to acknowledge the great progress that has already been made to strike a bipartisan consensus. I especially want to commend Chairman Miller, Subcommittee Chairwoman McCarthy and Ranking Member McKeon, along with their staffs, for working together to strengthen this important effort to protect our nation's teens against abuse and neglect in residential treatment facilities. I stand in strong support of this important legislation and encourage  my colleagues to also support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I want to thank Congressman Platts for his support of this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6358">H.R. 6358</bill>, "Stop the Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens". I would like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Education and Labor for bringing this very important legislation to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Capitol Hill we often debate matters that can address varying viewpoints. I believe that this legislation can only be looked at from two angles--right and wrong. I do believe that this bill must restore the spot check visits by HHS which have been deleted--the agencies in Texas are guilty of many abuses and these visits can save children's lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are everybody's children, and nobody's children. They are the forgotten children in the Texas foster care and residential care system. Black, White, Hispanic, and Asian--they all need the love of a mother, the nurturing of a family, and the support of their community. Some of them find homes with caring foster parents or in treatment centers with experienced and caring providers. And some do not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation allows us to keep our children safe with:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New national standards for private and public residential programs:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prohibit programs from physically, mentally, or sexually abusing children in their care;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prohibit programs from denying children essential water, food, clothing, shelter, or medical care--whether as a form of punishment or for any other reason;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Require that programs only physically restrain children if it is necessary for their safety or the safety of others, and to do so in a way that is consistent with existing Federal law on the use of restraints;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Require programs to provide children with reasonable access to a telephone and inform children of their right to use the phone;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Require programs to train staff in understanding what constitutes child abuse and neglect and how to report it; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Require programs to have plans in place to provide emergency medical care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prevent deceptive marketing by residential programs for teens:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Require programs to disclose to parents the qualifications, roles, and responsibilities of all current staff members;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Require programs to notify parents of substantiated reports of child abuse or violations of health and safety laws; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Require programs to include a link or Web address for the Web site of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which will carry information on residential programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hold teen residential programs accountable for violating the law:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Require States to inform the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services of reports of child abuse and neglect at covered programs and require HHS to conduct investigations of such programs to determine if a violation of the national standards has occurred; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Give HHS the authority to assess civil penalties of up to $50,000 against programs for every violation of the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ask States to step in to protect teens in residential programs: Three years after enactment, the legislation would provide certain Federal grant money to States only if they develop their own licensing standards (that are at least as strong as national standards) for public and private residential programs for teens and implement a monitoring and enforcement system, including conducting unannounced site inspections of all programs at least once every 2 years. The Department of Health and Human  Services would continue to inspect programs where a child fatality has occurred or where a pattern of violations has emerged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation seeks to protect the unprotected--our children--from abuse, neglect and exploitation. Many of these children are not safe, and their futures are uncertain. The groups serving children and adolescents with mental health or substance use conditions need better regulation. The youth boot camps and other "alternative placement facilities" should be forced to provide greater transparency as to the policies and practices of their programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is a welcomed and needed response to numerous studies documenting the ineffectiveness of these programs and, in several instances, the tragic deaths as a result of child abuse and neglect as reported by the GAO in October 2007. Too many families struggle mightily in nearly every State to find placements, when appropriate, for their children that will address their complex mental health needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These facilities flourish, in part, because parents lack the necessary information about the operation and practices of these programs. The promise of help cannot be allowed to obscure the fact that these kinds of programs are not science-based and have not been forthcoming about the incidence of neglect or abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This addresses the challenges facing many families. It seeks relief from these risks by (1) establishing standards for these programs that are consistent with current child protection laws; (2) ensuring that personnel are qualified; (3) shifting these programs to be family-centered, as well as culturally and developmentally appropriate; (4) creating mechanisms for the monitoring and enforcement of these goals; (5) calling for greater transparency and accessibility to the compliance of these standards;  and (6) providing grants to States for the prevention of child abuse and neglect and for the treatment of children's mental health or substance use conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the annual report to Congress is an effective tool in ensuring that these critical issues emerge from the shadows and see the light of day. I share the vision and commitment of Chairman MILLER and the Education and Labor Committee in protecting our youth from such predators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote for our children, vote for our families, and vote for <bill type="h" number="6358">H.R. 6358</bill>.</paragraph>
