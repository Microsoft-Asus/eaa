  <speaking speaker="412210" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today dismayed by the Department of Transportation's decision to rush dangerous Mexican trucks onto American roads.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last month, this House voted twice to impose severe restraints on any cross-border trucking program. Three weeks ago, we passed my Safe American Roads Act by an overwhelming, bipartisan 411-3 margin. The supplemental appropriations bill included similar language. It passed both Houses, and it was signed into law by the President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But although we have twice loudly and unambiguously rebuked the Department of Transportation, they are simply ignoring the American people. On Friday, they announced plans to launch a cross-border pilot program anyway, in clear violation of both Houses and the will of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their actions are deceptive, and they are intolerable. The people's House cannot be sidestepped through bureaucratic trickery. I urge the DOT to put the brakes on this profoundly undemocratic course of action. The safety of our highways is at stake.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
