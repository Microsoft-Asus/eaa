    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of House Resolution 1200, honoring the dedication and the outstanding work of military support groups for their steadfast work on behalf of the members of the Armed Forces and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 1.7 million military men and women have deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan since September of 2001, many of whom have been deployed more than once. These military men and women have left behind beloved parents, siblings and spouses. More than 782,000 children have had parents leave the confines of their home to serve the Nation nobly. These soldiers and their families face a daily struggle with constant and sustained deployments. Children are left to cope with the difficulties of a sustained  deployment with one parent supporting the family, and some are even left with other family members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Military men and women and their families make tremendous sacrifices every single day to serve and protect our country. These heroes deserve all the medical, the financial, the educational and moral support that our Nation can provide them. Military support groups, with that mission in mind, work diligently to provide essential support and services to the members of the Armed Forces and their families. They provide a compassionate community of supporters to military families, whether their loved  ones are at home or abroad. Whether it's finding a job, replacing a broken oven in a home, or offering moral support by sending care packages to soldiers abroad, our American military support groups and their volunteers work tirelessly to serve the men and women who serve to protect our way of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The positive impact that military support groups have on our soldiers and their families is invaluable. As Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recognized, the families and community members who support America's troops are "the power behind the power." You can go to the America Supports You Web site which lists the hundreds of military support groups across our country. The Web site also has many  stories of dedication, hope, kindness and generosity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1200 is our way, in Congress, of honoring the commitment and the outstanding work of military support groups and their volunteers across the country for their unwavering support of America's troops and their families. We honor their selfless service to American troops and their loved ones. As a cosponsor of House Resolution 1200, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this very important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400077" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me begin on a personal note. I just want to say what a great pleasure it is for me, Mr. Speaker, to manage this bill and the series of bills with my good friend from Guam whom I sit on the House Armed Services Committee with and the Natural Resources Committee with and whom I've been to Iraq three times with. I know of nobody that cares more about our military and men and women in uniform than my good friend from Guam, so it's wonderful to be with her in this particular venue today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1200, a resolution authored by Congresswoman BETTY SUTTON of Ohio. This resolution commends a large group of selfless and dedicated people, many of whom are volunteers, in organizations that provide support to the families and children of the deployed members of the Armed Forces, as well as to servicemembers themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our military families face extraordinary demands and stresses, Mr. Speaker, and challenges related to the service of their loved ones. To ease these burdens, military support groups provide a variety of crucial services ranging from financial and employment assistance to counseling and community support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These military support groups take on various forms, whether they be Federal, State and local government efforts, or whether they are the many nonprofit, charitable and private efforts that have continuously and unselfishly supported the members of our Armed Forces and their families ever since September 11, 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the approximately 1.8 million family members of the 1.3 million active duty personnel, the needs are many and supporting those needs is a matter of military readiness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The support challenge is made more complex because virtually all the families of the National Guard troops and reservists reside in civilian communities spread across this Nation. Yet numerous agencies, Mr. Speaker, and groups have taken on the challenge to provide help and support, particularly during extended periods of mobilization and deployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our military forces could not have sustained the stress of repeated deployments and combat without the outstanding assistance, dedication and outstanding work over the years of these military support groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me add on a personal note, if I may, Mr. Speaker, my grandfather and father were both career military personnel. And like many people in this Chamber, I have many members of my family, uncles, cousins, my own brother, who served at various points in the military. All of them would tell you that they have received valuable support for both themselves and their families repeatedly from private and charitable groups that are designed to support the men and women that wear the uniform of the  United States. Our citizens do that, not simply because it's the expedient thing to do, but because it's the right thing to do, and it's an expression of the appreciation of the American people for the men and women who sacrifice to defend them that these sorts of contributions take place. Today's resolution is a fitting way to celebrate and thank such organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 1200.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to my friend and colleague, the original sponsor of this important resolution, the gentlelady from Ohio (Ms. Sutton).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412228" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership on this issue, and I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for his eloquence in speaking to it as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today, Mr. Speaker, in support of House Resolution 1200, a resolution I introduced to honor some of the unsung heroes of our Nation. They are our military support groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All across our great Nation and throughout the world, our troops and their families are making incredible sacrifices for our country. Since 2001, more than 1.7 million members of the Armed Forces have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. And many of these brave men and women are being sent back for numerous tours of duty, and each time they represent our country with honor and a proud sense of duty. And we must never forget the incredible service they provide for our great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We, as Members of Congress, must do everything in our power to ease the burden their service places on them and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One incredible source of support and assistance for our troops and their families are military support groups. All across our country, servicemembers and their families and friends have formed these crucial support networks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Military support groups offer a variety of important services to members of our Armed Forces and their families. From providing financial assistance, employment assistance and tax return preparation, to offering counseling and prayer groups, sending care packages and writing letters, support groups serve a vital purpose within the military family and within our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill, House Resolution 1200, honors the dedication and outstanding work of military support groups across this country for their steadfast support of the members of our Armed Forces and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm very proud, Mr. Speaker, that one of these support groups, Family and Friends Connected, is based in Akron, Ohio, in my congressional district. This group was started by one of my constituents, Saundra Hunt. With a daughter in the Air Force and a son in the Marine Corps, Saundra knows more than a thing or two about the need to support our military families. And so, on November 9, 2001, Saundra established Family and Friends Connected to bring military families together. And on the second  Friday of every month, military families and friends from all over northeastern Ohio come together to support one another. They come from Akron and Barberton and Canton and Cleveland; they come from Cuyahoga Falls, and Copley and Dover and Hartville, Hudson, Stow and Tallmadge and Wadsworth. They come together to find common support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to take a moment and recognize Saundra, who took her own family's experience and used it to make a positive impact on the lives of others in the same situation. Saundra dedicates a listening ear to military families, and is available to them at every hour, day or night. Because of her endless commitment and compassion, there is an obvious love for her within the group.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've had the honor and privilege of attending one of their meetings, and I can attest firsthand to the dedication and the uplifting camaraderie of those who participate in Family and Friends Connected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Saundra and the Family and Friends Connected are just one example of the many support groups across the country that have provided endless amounts of time, energy and compassion to our military families. These are people who truly understand what military families go through, and they provide very real comfort and support for one another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The kindness and understanding these groups provide to our servicemembers and to each other is nothing short of inspirational. It is such an important service for our Nation's military families and yet, Mr. Speaker, they ask for nothing in return. They do it because of a love of country, a respect for service, and an understanding of the sacrifices that our military families so selflessly make. Their unwavering emotional and material support helps to fortify our military, allowing them to  carry out the missions our Nation asks of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We, in Congress, must always honor our brave servicemen and women, in word and in deed. Likewise, we should  honor those who dedicate themselves to their support. That's why I introduced this important resolution to honor these amazing groups. They did not ask for any recognition for their service, but we can all agree that they deserve to be honored for all they do for our military families and for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask for your support of this critical resolution honoring our military support groups.</paragraph>
