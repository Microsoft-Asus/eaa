    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent we now proceed to a period for morning business with Senators permitted to speak therein for a period of up to 10 minutes each.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="300087" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Matthew Shepard Act as an amendment to the DOD authorization bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Federal hate crimes legislation is a much-needed and long missing piece of the civil rights and criminal law puzzle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I would like to thank my friend and colleague, Senator Kennedy, for his determination and leadership on this bipartisan amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank my friends and colleagues--Majority Leader Reid and Chairman Levin--for their support of hate crimes legislation and this amendment. Many people had amendments they wanted on this bill, but Senator Levin and Senator Reid understood the importance of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. King once said "In order to answer the question, `where do we go from here?'. . . we must first honestly recognize where we are now."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are still in a time where racism and other hatred are ever-present.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are still in a time when our old scars and wounds from times past have not healed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, we have made progress, but all of us know we have a long way to go. And the only way we can get there is if we travel together, as one Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And if our Federal Government can say with one strong, unified voice that crimes based on hatred will not be tolerated, then that is a step forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we can also say that those hate-mongers who commit these crimes will not get off lightly; but rather will pay the consequences of committing a crime against a larger community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can all say this together by voting for the Matthew Shepard Act before us today. The act is named for a brave and courageous individual, who was killed simply because of who he was. This act deserves a quick and strong passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been here before. In 2004, this body passed hate crimes legislation, only to see it stripped away in conference. And I stand before my colleagues today to say--it is time to pass this legislation once again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Current Federal hate crime laws are inadequate to deal with the rising tide of hate crimes that are tearing at the very fabric of our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would remove the "federally protected activity" requirement that currently exists, and also expand the groups of individuals that are covered by Federal law including sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, this legislation gives much needed resources and assistance to State and local law enforcement officials in investigating and prosecuting these crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me clear, this legislation allows the Federal Government to act only with the consent of State or local law enforcement officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This law can be seen as a backstop--in case State hate crime laws do not cover a particular crime, or if State or local officials need the resources of Federal law enforcement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This should assuage any federalism concerns that some of my colleagues may have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, Congress has the clear mandate to act in this arena, based on both our authority under the commerce clause and the 13th amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This type of crime--violence based on a person's skin color, religion, ethnicity, or other traits and characteristics, are as old as slavery itself. It is unconscionable. Matthew Shepard was killed because of his sexual orientation. Who can defend that? Who can say we should not increase the strength of the laws to deal with that hatred, bigotry and nastiness?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hate crimes differ from other crimes because the criminals target groups of individuals who have been traditionally marginalized or stigmatized in our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This violence directly affects an individual's ability to feel safe and secure in a particular location, and has the effect of forcing people from their homes, or impeding their ability to travel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, hate crimes are greater crimes. These crimes affect an entire community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are not aimed at one individual. In fact, they are often not aimed at the individual upon whom they are committed but, rather, a much broader group. In that sense, these crimes are anti-American. They fly in the face of American pluralism, "E Pluribus Unum" that is on every dollar bill we see. Yes, out of many, one. Those who commit hate crimes are saying: No, there are certain groups of people who should not become part of the American fabric.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What could be more un-American than that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hate crimes must stop. The violence directly affects an individual's ability to feel safe and secure in a particular location and has the effect of forcing people from their homes or impeding their ability to travel. But, additionally, they are greater crimes because they affect an entire community, not just one individual. In that way, these crimes hurt all of us--the American community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of that, the perpetrators of these crimes should be punished for their actions; both Federal and local law enforcement working together to punish the perpetrator is an important and sometimes necessary signal showing that violence motivated by hatred  is not tolerated at any level. This legislation enjoys a broad range of support from numerous civil rights organizations to the National District Attorneys Association; rightfully so, since this  affects all of us as Americans. I urge my colleague to vote for this important piece of civil rights and criminal law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we will get an overwhelming vote from both sides of the aisle, a condemnation of hatred, a condemnation of pointing to a particular group and saying: You don't belong. You can be subject to vicious and nasty crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
