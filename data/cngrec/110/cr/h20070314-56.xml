  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from Indiana (Ms. Carson) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400067" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the Lilly Endowment for its exceptional commitment to Indianapolis and to the State of Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, the Lilly Endowment announced the winners of its 2007 Teacher Creativity Fellowships. The result of this endowment's effort is a program that will enable 129 teachers, principals, guidance counselors, and school librarians from all over Indiana to take the time to gain insight into new cultures, to explore subjects that intrigue them, and to just get away and bring back refreshed perspectives to share with their students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The endowment has been successfully funding such programs for 20 years now. The class of 2007 includes nine recipients from public and private schools across the State who were selected as "distinguished fellows" of the program and received up to $25,000. The remaining 120 recipients each received an $8,000 grant for their activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The distinguished fellows feature of the program was introduced last year by the Lilly Endowment. A limited number of grants were available for creative renewal projects that would provide additional financial support and the possibility of time away from the classroom. As a result of this innovative feature, each selected teacher received up to $25,000. A separate grant of up to $25,000 was available to the teacher's school district to cover the costs of a replacement teacher, if necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The winning creative renewal projects will send Indiana educators to study Indian culture by visiting Punjab, India; practice service learning by volunteering in Calcutta, Belfast, reservations in South Dakota, Haiti, and Mississippi; and interviewing street children in Latin America. But whether they travel to the Arctic or Mongolia, they will return to their Indiana schools carrying new cultural insights, full of new adventures and wisdom to share with their students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sara B. Cobb, the Lilly Endowment Vice President for Education, summarized the effort when she said, "Once again, we are thrilled at the response to this popular program. Good teaching requires a high degree of energy and motivation. We regularly hear that these renewal experiences have helped hard-working Indiana educators regain their enthusiasm for their profession."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, I want to commend the Lilly Endowment for doing such a great thing for Indiana and the education system. Good teaching does require a high degree of energy, motivation, and inspiration. I would add, "Good corporate neighboring requires a commitment to a corporate vision for a better community and the will to invest its resources to achieve that vision."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the Lilly Endowment and its CEO, and indeed a good neighbor to Indiana. Thank you very much.</paragraph>
