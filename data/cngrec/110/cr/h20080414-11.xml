  <narrative>AMERICA IS NOT AS SECURE TODAY -- (House of Representatives - April 14, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2228]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. BROUN of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412252" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, America is not as secure today as it was just several weeks ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The leadership in the House has not allowed the Protect America Act to come to the floor, and, thus, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot monitor what Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan or Pakistan are talking about or his phone calls to Iran or any other place in this world. FISA only monitors phone calls from one foreign entity to another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The leadership seems more bent on protecting lawsuits than they are in protecting America. I call upon the leadership to let us vote on the Protect America Act so that we can make America secure again.</paragraph>
