    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the sound of gunshots could be heard throughout Iraq last week. Unlike most days, however, it was not the sound of civil war. Instead, it was the sounds of celebration as Iraq won a pivotal soccer match over their Saudi rivals. The return to violence that is the new Iraqi way of life did not take long, however.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most Iraqi families are living in unimaginable circumstances. Nearly one-third of the children are malnourished, and some 15 percent of Iraqis regularly cannot afford to eat. That's according to a recent Oxfam report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The high for Baghdad today was forecast at 121 degrees. Electricity is available for about 2 hours a day. Children are out of school, and regular employment is becoming harder and harder to come by. In these conditions, it is hard to sustain hope. For a country so rich in resources, it is disturbing to hear the stories of families trapped in slums begging for clean drinking water. Mothers scourge to find books and paper for school lessons. It is no wonder. Over 4 million Iraqis have been displaced  from their homes and have sought refuge in neighboring provinces or nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United Nations estimates that 50,000 Iraqis leave their homes and become refugees every single month. That is the equivalent of one Biloxi or one Idaho Falls every month. It hits home even more when we think of a population the size of San Rafael or Petaluma, both in my congressional district. This is each month, Mr. Speaker; and the situation isn't getting any better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have spent half a trillion dollars on this occupation. Where has it gotten us? If only a fraction of the money we were spending on tanks and bombs was redirected to reconstruction and reconciliation, what a different country Iraq could be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district in Marin and Sonoma counties alone, the taxpayers have shelled out $1.5 billion for this Iraqi occupation. If we really wanted to make America safer, this same amount, just the money from my district alone, could have paid for nearly 29,000 public safety officers or 20,000 port container inspectors. That's the real way to defend our homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't need to wait until September to see if the administration's efforts in Iraq are working. They haven't worked from the beginning. We were not met as liberators. We are not making America safer. Our continuing  presence only serves as a recruiting tool for new terrorists. How can anyone think to put our troops in harm's way merely to serve a political legacy?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both the American and Iraqi people have consistently sent the clear message: Bring the troops home. Not in 2009 or whenever a new President comes along. The time is now, and we must not delay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This will require bold actions, but our troops deserve nothing less than to be brought safely home to their families.</paragraph>
