    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of the House, <bill type="h" number="719">H.R. 719</bill>, the KIDS Act, addresses the problems of convicted sex offenders infiltrating the Internet to contact and prey on minors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You've heard about this problem before under the measure that has just passed the House. We are all familiar with the problem. There is not a parent who is not concerned that through the Internet a sex offender may attempt to contact a child for criminal, vicious sex purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The KIDS Act addresses this problem in three ways: It authorizes funding for the Federal Probation and Pretrial Office to enhance the agency's ability to monitor the computer use by convicted Federal sex offenders. In particular, it authorizes funding to evaluate and purchase Internet filtering and monitoring systems to better enable probation officers to monitor the computer use of sex offenders. This is very important. This should help ensure that if an offender violates the terms of release  as to Internet use, the violation will be discovered so the offender's release can be promptly revoked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next thing we do here is codify the current practice of some sentencing judges by specifically authorizing a court to require as a condition of probation that a convicted sex offender cooperate with the installation of Internet filtering and monitoring systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill directs the Sentencing Commission to consider increased penalties for sex crimes committed over the Internet where the defendant lied about his age or concealed identity as a sex offender.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure before us now adds a new criminal provision to reach those who set up "virtual money systems" to facilitate the trafficking of child pornography over the Internet. There's no simple way of keeping the Internet out of the hands of those who would use it for these and other sinister purposes. Nonetheless, the KIDS Act goes a long way toward addressing the problem of Internet sex predation by enhancing supervision of convicted sex offenders and increasing penalties for these crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can't imagine anyone in this House on either side of the aisle not supporting a measure such as this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400154" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, recently we were all shocked to learn that over 20,000 registered sex offenders were on commercial social networking sites. In response to press attention, the social networking sites removed the sex offenders from these sites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="719">H.R. 719</bill>, as introduced, included an important provision requiring that sex offenders update their registration information to include their electronic mail addresses, instant messaging addresses, and other similar Internet identifiers used by the sex offender.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, <bill type="h" number="719">H.R. 719</bill> included a mechanism to permit social networking sites to check sex offender registries to prevent sex offenders from accessing the social networking site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, <bill type="h" number="719">H.R. 719</bill> included on introduction a new criminal prohibition on misrepresentation of age by a person designed to lure children into sexual activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, <bill type="h" number="719">H.R. 719</bill> has been stripped of all of these important provisions. It's my hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will work with us to address these important provisions in the future. The gap in our laws must be filled so that children on social networking sites do not have to fear sex predators joining their circle of so-called friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to commend my colleagues for including in this legislation a critical provision to prohibit the financial facilitation of child pornography. Originally proposed by our ranking member, LAMAR SMITH, at the beginning of the year, this criminal penalty is vitally important for prosecuting an emerging tool used by child pornographers to prey on children anonymously: virtual money systems. Unlike credit card companies, which require merchants and customers to provide personal information  such as name, address, and Social Security number, virtual money is essentially anonymous. Subscribers provide fictitious personal information, or no personal information, and no credit card or Social Security number is required, making them virtually untraceable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The key to combating the commercial child pornography industry is to cut it off at its source: money. Virtual money is now the payment method of choice. It is imperative that our law enforcement tools keep pace with changing technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="719">H.R. 719</bill> also includes a technical correction to the Adam Walsh Act to expand the eligibility for participation in a child safety grant program. And I want to particularly thank Congressman Forbes, the ranking member of the Crime Subcommittee, for introducing legislation that would have accomplished this technical correction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend my colleague from North Dakota (Mr. Pomeroy) for his dedication to protecting children and for working with us on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) for the hard work that he has put in on this measure. We appreciate the cooperation that we've had in the course of this. And of course we yield to no one in recognizing him as the Congress' foremost expert on the Internet, and thus his being involved in this kind of legislation for quite a few years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier versions of this bill required registration of online identifiers of sex offenders. And as the gentleman knows, a sex offender can change his user name and IP address in about two seconds, so we didn't feel that was particularly helpful. We thought monitoring sex offenders before they ever got on the Internet was a better way to go, and we're glad that we've been able to reach some closure with him on that subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, on the criminal provisions, I want to tactfully suggest that we've got a better way here in this bill, and I think most of the lawyers and those who followed this shall agree with us. There is no point in overburdening prosecutors. What we've done with reference to criminal provisions is that the practice of grooming, where sex predators lie about their age on the Internet to entice minors into sexual activity, obviously is horrific and widespread, but the other approach would have required  prosecutors to prove a new and separate offense in order to get a higher sentence for offenses involving grooming. We didn't think that would be the better way to proceed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the minority approach, a prosecutor would have had to prove all the elements of this new crime beyond a reasonable doubt. This is, I think, unnecessary and probably a very high burden to reach, given that there exists in criminal law a law against enticement that covers grooming activity. And so the approach we finally settled on directs the sentencing commission to provide tougher sentences for predatory behavior that involves grooming.  And you  don't get the chairman of this committee talking about tougher sentencing on very many things around here; this is one that I can support without qualification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we've done is deal with a serious problem of grooming and get to the same place as other approaches that have been suggested to us in what we believe, from a criminal justice point of view, is far more efficient. And with the new provisions that would fight financial facilitation of child pornography, we think we've got a bill. And we thank Mr. Pomeroy for helping us get there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400154" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I have no further speakers remaining on this legislation, so I would yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have the final closing speaker, Mr. Pomeroy, to whom I will yield the balance of our time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400323" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend, the chairman, for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to begin by acknowledging the work Paul Gillmor put into this legislation. He and I were the original cosponsors. He was a colleague with whom I worked on a variety of initiatives trying to keep our children safe against those who would prey upon them through the Internet. We miss Paul, but his efforts and his work continue with this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with the words of the chairman in the facet of this bill relating to grooming, and I think stiffening the sentences for those convicted of engaging in deceptive behavior relative to lying about their age to incur the trust of minors with whom they're interacting on the Internet, making that an item that would bring them longer prison time when convicted is a positive clarification to this bill, probably better than the original bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a feature of the bill that was left out, that I'm quite disappointed at, and work is going to need to continue on this one, and that is, helping these Internet sites keep sexual predators off in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a number of provisions in our code dealing with what's required of high-risk sexual predators, and I believe it would be appropriate to have a voluntary registry where their names would be required to be on file, and social networking sites could keep them off of their site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to especially commend the efforts of MySpace, one of the most popular sites out there, for the extraordinary efforts they've gone to to identify sex predators and keep them off the site; 29,000 are blocked from participating on the MySpace domain because of their efforts, and I think the Federal Government ought to do more to help them. That's work in progress. A lot of bills that come to the floor aren't perfect, at least at this iteration in the legislative process, so this is an aspect  of this bill I want to continue to work on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a couple of other things that I think are very useful, and that is the authorization of funds to step up the supervision of the Internet activities of high-risk sexual predators, as well as the portion that criminalizes financial facilitation of child pornography. If there is a banker making a buck by basically facilitating the credit card transactions on child pornography over the Internet, that is not an acceptable business practice. It is so not acceptable that we are criminalizing  it, and I hope they get that message loud and clear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've worked a lot with the Judiciary Committee on this bill. I think the chairman's comments about higher sentences aren't something that he is often willing to put in a code. I think that he has been fair-minded in this, and I look forward to continuing to work with him as we get this legislation where it needs to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you. This is a positive bill. I urge Members to vote for it.</paragraph>
