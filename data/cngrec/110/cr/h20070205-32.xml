    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues, Congresswoman BARBARA LEE, Dr. CHRISTENSEN, Congresswoman Waters, Congressman Towns, Congresswoman Kilpatrick, and many of my other colleagues in support of the goals and ideals of National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unbelievable, Madam Speaker, to hear the numbers that are escalating now with HIV/AIDS in the African American community, which accounted for nearly 50 percent of all new  HIV infections despite representing only about 12.3 percent of the population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CDC estimates that in 2005, African American women accounted for over 66 percent of all HIV/AIDS cases among women and were 25 times more likely to be infected than white women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Drastic, drastic, drastic decisions have to be made. We may be able to address this question by educating, but I do believe we must confront the question of testing. In our high schools today we are finding that there are those who are proving to be HIV positive as early as ninth grade and as early as middle school. We have to address this question. I ask my colleagues to wake up and confront this crisis in America.</paragraph>
