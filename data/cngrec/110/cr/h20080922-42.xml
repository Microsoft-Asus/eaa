    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of House Resolution 1466, honoring Dr. Guion S. "Guy" Bluford, Jr. on the 25th anniversary of his historic flight as the first African American in space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year marks the 50th anniversary of the House Committee on Science and Technology and also the 50th anniversary of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The past five decades of our space program have brought remarkable achievements in human space flight and in human exploration, in space and Earth science and in aeronautics. Mr. Speaker, these achievements would not have been possible without the contributions of many individuals who have served NASA and our space program. Some of those individuals also broke barriers along the way and have provided inspiration to all of those who have followed them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, we honored the 25th anniversary of Dr. Sally K. Ride's flight as the first woman in space. Today, we celebrate the 25th anniversary of Dr. Guion S. Bluford, Jr. as the first African American in space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Bluford's path to his pioneering flight exemplifies the "right stuff" so characteristic of NASA's astronauts. He graduated from Penn State University with a degree in aerospace engineering. As a distinguished Air Force ROTC graduate, he went on to complete pilot training and combat crew training, flew combat missions, and returned to serve with the 3630th Flying Training Wing at Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Bluford went on to earn master's and doctoral degrees in aerospace engineering from the Air Force Institute of Technology, and he held several positions in the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1979, Dr. Bluford became a NASA astronaut. On August 30, 1983, he made history when he lifted off with the space shuttle crew of STS-8 as the first African American in space. During the mission, the crew successfully deployed a satellite, conducted operations with the shuttle's robotic arm and collected measurements to improve our understanding of how space affects biophysiological systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On October 30, 1985, Dr. Bluford flew with the crew of STS-61-A, a German D-1 spacelab mission that included over 70 scientific experiments in materials processing, in life sciences, in fluid physics, and in navigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would add, Mr. Speaker, that, indeed, that was my mission at spacelab while I was at Goddard Space Flight Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His third and fourth flights on shuttle STS-39 in 1991 and on shuttle STS-53 in 1992 involved deploying payloads and in conducting numerous experiments. During his astronaut service, Dr. Bluford logged over 688 hours in space. In 1993, Dr. Bluford left NASA and retired from the Air Force to accept a position in private industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Dr. Guion Bluford's leadership as an aviator, as an astronaut and as a private sector official is an inspiration for all Americans. I urge my colleagues in Congress to join me in saluting Dr. Guion S. "Guy" Bluford, Jr. on the 25th anniversary of his historic flight as the first African American in space and to honor his distinguished service to the Nation and to the space program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of House Resolution 1466, which honors the life and accomplishments of an amazing man, astronaut Dr. Guy Bluford, Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Guy Bluford was born in West Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on November 22, 1942, and he is perhaps best known as the first African American in space. He was selected for NASA's astronaut program in August 1979, and he became a mission specialist on the eighth space shuttle mission, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida on August 30, 1983. This was the third flight of the space shuttle Challenger and the first mission with a night launch and with a night landing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Bluford is a veteran of four space flights. After STS-8, Dr. Bluford went on to serve as mission specialist on STS-61-A, on STS-39 and on STS-53, and he logged over 688 hours in space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These early missions paved the way for the scientific research and international cooperation that today are vital aspects of the International Space Station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to his service with NASA, Guy Bluford received a bachelor of science degree in aerospace engineering from Pennsylvania State University in 1964, a master's of science degree with distinction in aerospace engineering from the Air Force Institute of Technology in 1974, a doctor of philosophy in aerospace engineering with a minor in laser physics from the Air Force Institute of Technology in 1978, and a master's of business administration from the University of Houston, Clear Lake, in 1987.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is, perhaps, less well-known about Guy Bluford is the service he has given to the Nation since leaving the astronaut corps. After leaving NASA in July 1993, he retired from the Air Force and held several executive-level positions in America's aerospace industry. Dr. Bluford also served the Nation in other capacities, including as a member of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. He has been a member of the National Research Council Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board. He has served  on the board of trustees of the Aerospace Corporation and on the board of advisors for the Coalition for Space Exploration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to support this resolution honoring such a prominent American citizen, executive and astronaut. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 1466.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
