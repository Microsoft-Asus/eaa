  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, section 310 of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, the 2008 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations, aggregates, and other levels for legislation that reauthorizes terrorism risk insurance, provided that such legislation does not worsen the deficit over the period of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2017.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find that <bill type="h" number="2761">H.R. 2761</bill>, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, which cleared the House of Representatives today, satisfies the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund for terrorism risk insurance reauthorization. Therefore, pursuant to section 310, I am adjusting the aggregates in the 2008 budget resolution, as well as the allocation provided to the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill> be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
