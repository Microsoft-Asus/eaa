    <paragraph>Mr. President, a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine examined the link between the presence of guns in the home and the chance of suicide. The article, written by Dr. Matthew Miller and Dr. David Hemenway, entitled "Guns and Suicide in the United States," illustrates a direct correlation between having a loaded firearm in a home and the success rate of suicide attempts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the article, in 2005, the most recent year mortality data are available, suicide was the second leading cause of death among Americans 40 years of age or younger. More than half of all suicides in the United States are carried out by a firearm. An average of 46 Americans per day committed suicide with a firearm in 2005, accounting for 53 percent of all completed suicides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the attempts made at suicide are both impulsive and fleeting. There is often a very short window between the time a person decides they are going to attempt suicide and the time they follow through with the attempt. These attempts are often made drastically, in reaction to a specific event. However, as the initial reaction to the event subsides, so often does the urge to attempt suicide. This is illustrated by the fact that more than 90 percent of the people who survive a suicide attempt,  do not go on to die by suicide. Unfortunately, those attempt suicide using a firearm are rarely fortunate enough to survive and thus have an opportunity for reconsideration. Suicide attempts that involve drugs or cutting have a much lower mortality rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The article cites over a dozen studies that have found that there is between a two and ten times greater risk of suicide in a home with a firearm than without. These risks do not only increase for the gun owner but also for the gun owner's spouse and children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The simple fact is that guns increase the chance of suicide. Suicide prevention is a national problem that demands our attention and commitment. Congress must do its part by taking such steps as ensuring gun manufacturers supply trigger locks and closing the loopholes that allow young people easy access to guns.</paragraph>
