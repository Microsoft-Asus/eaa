    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Guam?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of <bill type="h" number="1855">H.R. 1855</bill>, as amended, is to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide support for the design and the construction of the Madera Water Supply and Enhancement Project in California's Central Valley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similar legislation was introduced by Congressman Radanovich in the 109th Congress and passed by the House. With the concurrence of the minority, <bill type="h" number="1855">H.R. 1855</bill> has been amended to simplify the legislation and to ensure there is no doubt that this project should be promptly funded and constructed without further studies of its feasibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have no objection to this noncontroversial bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1855">H.R. 1855</bill> and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation, sponsored by our California colleague and former Water and Power Subcommittee Chair GEORGE RADANOVICH, authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to participate in the design and construction of the Madera Water Supply and Enhancement Project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Due to a rapidly growing population and lawsuits filed, once again we hear about those lawsuits filed by San Francisco-based environmental organizations, the San Joaquin Valley of California faces increasing demands on its limited water supply. If excess water in the San Joaquin River exists, this project would store those flows in a nearby aquifer underneath the 13,000-acre Madera Ranch. This stored water bank could prove critical to meeting demands in dry years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also unilaterally declares the project feasible, which is something the bureaucracy would normally take years and much paperwork to decide. We commend the majority for agreeing to this rarely-used congressional declaration for a water storage project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my colleague across the aisle again, a Member of Congress with true grace and class. I appreciate her work on these bills, and I urge my colleagues to support this particular legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it has been a pleasure to work with my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert), in managing these noncontroversial bills this afternoon, and I want to thank him very much. I hope we have the opportunity again.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400330" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3897">H.R. 3897</bill>, the Madera Water Supply Enhancement Act. This legislation authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to participate in the design and construction of the Madera Water Supply Enhancement Project. This important water bank project will help improve water supply in California's San Joaquin Valley, which includes my congressional district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Project will be located on the over 13,000-acre Madera Ranch, where the soils are ideal for percolating water from the surface to the aquifer for storage. The land is also a valuable habitat for numerous species and contains large sections of the region's native grasslands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since I first introduced this legislation in early 2006 the water supply needs of the area have only increased. Court decisions and drought have led to an increasing demand on water supply in California. Groundwater pumping is exceeding groundwater recharge by approximately 100,000 acre-feet per year, causing severe groundwater level declines. This water bank, by storing excess water in wet years, will provide a much needed source of water in dry years and facilitate the restoration of groundwater  levels over time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Madera Irrigation District has worked tirelessly to develop this exciting and innovative project that will increase water supply, provide groundwater resource protection, contribute to habitat conservation and have other positive impacts on the severe water supply and reliability problem in the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The looming water crisis in California demands more feasible water supply projects, such as this water bank. I am encouraged by the authorization of this project and look forward to many more projects to ensure the water supply and quality in California. Companion legislation has been introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein. Hopefully, with the support of the Senate we will see this project come to fruition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to expand water supply opportunities in Madera and California's San Joaquin Valley.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="1855">H.R. 1855</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
