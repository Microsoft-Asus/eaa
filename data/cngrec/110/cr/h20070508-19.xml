  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, accountability has returned to Washington with a new Congress that takes its oversight responsibilities very seriously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past 4 months, Congress has conducted over 180 oversight hearings on issues very important to the American people. These are not just hearings; they're hearings that have led to action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Walter Reed: Since we concluded our hearing, we determined on a bipartisan basis after the information came out that more money was needed. We put $1.7 billion to make certain that we would take care of our wounded warriors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress now continues to oversee the ever-changing U.S. attorney scandal. The American people absolutely must have confidence that the U.S. Attorney's Office is about enforcing the law, not making it up as they go along or pursuing outcomes for partisan political reasons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we cannot have real accountability without congressional oversight, and this is one of the ways the new Democratic Congress is changing the way that we do business here in Washington.</paragraph>
