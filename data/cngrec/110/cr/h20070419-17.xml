  <speaking speaker="400639" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday, as military leaders were on the Hill explaining how well things were moving in Iraq, news outlets were reporting that 171 human beings were killed at a Baghdad market. The carnage seems to have no end, even as we see endless U.S. troops shipped into an Iraqi shooting gallery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress has approved a supplemental bill which provides everything the President requested and more. In fact, the bill provides plentifully, but appropriately, for the wounded who return home every month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The hope is that the President will sign the supplemental as the American public desires. Every opinion poll shows that the American public wants this war to end. Sign the supplemental.</paragraph>
