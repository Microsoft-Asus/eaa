    <paragraph>Mr. President, every now and then there is an article or an op-ed in the newspaper that you find compelling by its clear logic and you want to share it with your colleagues. I wish to do that today and at the conclusion of my remarks put the full text of this op-ed in the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's Wall Street Journal carried an op-ed by David Ranson called "You Can't Soak the Rich." I find it compelling because of the proposals by some that we should raise the marginal income tax rates and thereby theoretically increase revenues to the Treasury. What Ranson points out is it is essentially a law of economics that raising tax rates not only does not bring in more revenue to the Treasury based on the historic record, but it can have precisely the opposite effect because it can harm  the economy and, in fact, it is the growth in the economy that produces more revenue to the Federal Treasury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me quote a couple of comments from his op-ed. He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No matter what the tax rates have been, in postwar America tax revenues have remained at about 19.5 percent of GDP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there is another measure. If you go back somewhat less distance, the measure is about 1 percent less than that as a percentage of GDP, but the ratio remains the same and the point he is making remains the same, which is that raising tax rates does not raise revenue. In fact, raising tax rates can hurt the economy, which then reduces tax revenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a chart in this op-ed that makes the point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal tax yield, which is revenues divided by the gross domestic product, has remained close to 19.5 percent, even as the top tax bracket was brought down from 91 percent to the present 35 percent. One would think that the difference between a 91-percent top marginal rate and 35 percent would represent a dramatic difference in revenues collected. In point of fact, it has not been. He points out why a little bit later in his op-ed. He says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The data show that the tax yield has been independent of marginal tax rates over this period, but tax revenue is directly proportional to GDP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, the strength of the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He goes on:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So if we want to increase tax revenue, we need to increase GDP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What happens if we instead raise tax rates? Economists of all persuasions accept that a tax rate hike will reduce GDP, in which case Hauser's Law--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The law he is citing here--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>says it will also lower tax revenue. That's a highly inconvenient truth for redistributive tax policy, and it flies in the face of deeply felt beliefs about social justice. It would surely be unpopular today with those presidential candidates who plan to raise tax rates on the rich--if they knew about it.&lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He goes on to answer the question I posed earlier: What makes this law work? I am quoting now:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Mr. Hauser said: "Raising taxes encourages taxpayers to shift, hide and underreport income. ..... Higher taxes reduce the incentives to work, produce, invest and save, thereby dampening overall economic activity and job creation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Putting it a different way, capital migrates away from regimes in which it is treated harshly, and toward regimes in which it is free to be invested profitably and safely. In this regard, the capital controlled by our richest citizens is especially tax-intolerant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The point he is making is that if you are wealthy, you have the ability to move your income around, to hire accountants and tax lawyers to find ways to shield your income, and the bottom line is the Government never gets any more of it than if the rate remained at a lower level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, he points out that revenue collections by the Government have remained almost constant over this 40-year period and that their ratio to the GDP has remained almost constant; the point being that the revenue collected by the Government is most in relation to the state of the economy. It is mostly dependent upon the economy. As the economy grows, revenues to the Federal Treasury grow. As the economy slows, tax revenues slow, and that is exactly what we are seeing right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we should take two important lessons from this. No. 1, in a time of economic downturn, which is what we are in right now, the last thing you would want to do is to raise tax rates because you are going to hurt the economy and you are not going to bring in any additional revenue. Secondly, this speaks to the point my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, has been making, which is that, in the long term, what you want to do is reduce tax rates if you can--at least leave them where  they are but not raise them--if you want to be fair both to the American family and help the economy grow and get us out of this economic downturn. Incidentally, that is what will produce the most revenue for the Federal Treasury to pay for all that the Congress and the President end up passing in legislation and passing on to American taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I ask unanimous consent to place this op-ed in the Record at this point.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>[From the Wall Street Journal, May 20, 2008]</narrative>
  <narrative>(By David Ranson)</narrative>
  <narrative>Kurt Hauser is a San Francisco investment economist who, 15 years ago, published fresh and eye-opening data about the federal tax system. His findings imply that there are draconian constraints on the ability of tax-rate increases to generate fresh revenues. I think his discovery deserves to be called Hauser's Law, because it is as central to the economics of taxation as Boyle's Law is to the physics of gases. Yet economists and policy makers are barely aware of it.</narrative>
  <narrative>Like science, economics advances as verifiable patterns are recognized and codified. But economics is in a far earlier stage of evolution than physics. Unfortunately, it is often poisoned by political wishful thinking, just as medieval science was poisoned by religious doctrine. Taxation is an important example.</narrative>
  <narrative>The interactions among the myriad participants in a tax system are as impossible to unravel as are those of the molecules in a gas, and the effects of tax policies are speculative and highly contentious. Will increasing tax rates on the rich increase revenues,  as Barack Obama hopes, or hold back the economy, as John McCain fears? Or both?</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Hauser uncovered the means to answer these questions definitively. On this page in 1993, he stated that "No matter what the tax rates have been, in postwar America tax revenues have remained at about 19.5% of GDP." What a pity that his discovery has not been more widely disseminated.</narrative>
  <narrative>The chart, updating the evidence to 2007, confirms Hauser's Law. The federal tax "yield" (revenues divided by GDP) has remained close to 19.5%, even as the top tax bracket was brought down from 91% to the present 35%. This is what scientists call an "independence theorem," and it cuts the Gordian Knot of tax policy debate.</narrative>
  <narrative>The data show that the tax yield has been independent of marginal tax rates over this period, but tax revenue is directly proportional to GDP. So if we want to increase tax revenue, we need to increase GDP.</narrative>
  <narrative>What happens if we instead raise tax rates? Economists of all persuasions accept that a tax rate hike will reduce GDP, in which case Hauser's Law says it will also lower tax revenue. That's a highly inconvenient truth for redistributive tax policy, and it flies in the face of deeply felt beliefs about social justice. It would surely be unpopular today with those presidential candidates who plan to raise tax rates on the rich--if they knew about it.</narrative>
  <narrative>Although Hauser's Law sounds like a restatement of the Laffer Curve (and Mr. Hauser did cite Arthur Laffer in his original article), it has independent validity. Because Mr. Laffer's curve is a theoretical insight, theoreticians find it easy to quibble with. Test cases, where the economy responds to a tax change, always lend themselves to many alternative explanations. Conventional economists, despite immense publicity, have yet to swallow the Laffer Curve. When it is mentioned at all by critics,  it is often as an object of scorn.</narrative>
  <narrative>Because Mr. Hauser's horizontal straight line is a simple fact, it is ultimately far more compelling. It also presents a major opportunity. It seems likely that the tax system could maintain a 19.5% yield with a top bracket even lower than 35%.</narrative>
  <narrative>What makes Hauser's Law work? For supply-siders there is no mystery. As Mr. Hauser said: "Raising taxes encourages taxpayers to shift, hide and underreport income. ..... Higher taxes reduce the incentives to work, produce, invest and save, thereby dampening overall economic activity and job creation."</narrative>
  <narrative>Putting it a different way, capital migrates away from regimes in which it is treated harshly, and toward regimes in which it is free to be invested profitably and safely. In this regard, the capital controlled by our richest citizens is especially tax-intolerant.</narrative>
  <narrative>The economics of taxation will be moribund until economists accept and explain Hauser's Law. For progress to be made, they will have to face up to it, reconcile it with other facts, and incorporate it within the body of accepted knowledge. And if this requires overturning existing doctrine, then so be it.</narrative>
  <narrative>Presidential candidates, instead of disputing how much more tax to impose on whom, would be better advised to come up with plans for increasing GDP while ridding the tax system of its wearying complexity. That would be a formula for success.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="YOU CAN'T SOAK THE RICH">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to review the op-ed and apply it to the lessons we have today. In fact, the legislation we will be taking up today increases taxes--increases the tax rate--by applying a 0.5-cent surcharge or surtax on the top marginal rate. This is going to be very destructive. Over 80 percent of the people who report that top marginal rate, report small business income. So we are going to be hurting the small businesses of this country, not the big businesses or  the wealthy that the surcharge is intended to hit, and we will end up not increasing Federal revenues but actually decreasing them and hurting the economy in the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
