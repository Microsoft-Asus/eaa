    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Lance Mackey for being the first dog musher to win the Iditarod Sled Dog Race and the Yukon Quest Sled Dog Race--the world's two longest sled dog races--in the same year. He won both races earlier this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those who are not familiar with both races, this is an incredible accomplishment. To put his feat into perspective, Lance Mackey and his dogs traveled a total distance that is equal to traveling between Boston, MA and Salt Lake City, UT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Yukon Quest Sled Dog race is a 1,000-mile annual international sled dog race between Whitehorse, Canada, and Fairbanks, AK. The trail follows a portion of the Yukon River and trails used by gold prospectors over 100 years ago. On February 20, 2007, in Fairbanks, he completed this sled dog race in a record time of 10 days, 2 hours, and 37 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only 12 days after winning the Yukon Quest, Lance and 13 of his 16 dogs that completed the Yukon Quest race started the Iditarod Sled Dog Race. This race starts in Willow, AK and ends in Nome, AK, and is 1,100 miles long. The Iditarod trail originally started out as a supply route to numerous remote Alaska communities, including Nome. On March 13, 2007, Lance Mackey and his team completed this race in 9 days, 5 hours and 8 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both of these races travel through numerous small, rural Alaska villages but most of the trails pass through nothing but pure wilderness. Lance and his fellow mushers had to race through blizzards, temperatures as low as 40 degrees below zero, wind gusts up to 60 miles per hour, water overflows from partially frozen rivers and very rough terrain. Accidents due to terrain, trail conditions and other factors are not unusual. Occasionally, a moose will attack dog teams and mushers. Of course, these  elements add additional challenges to these already arduous races. In fact, 21 mushers "scratched"--or withdrew--from the Iditarod this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a throat cancer survivor, Lance has to always drink water after eating since his salivary glands were removed during cancer treatment. However, Lance Mackey continued to pursue victory and almost entirely shunned food and drink for the last 219 miles of the Iditarod in order to save time. In addition to that, he suffered from frostbite as he made his way to the finish line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conventional wisdom is that the same musher could not win both sled dog races in the same year. This year, Lance Mackey proved everyone wrong. We are proud of Lance and his dog team for this unprecedented achievement. Once again, I congratulate Lance Mackey and his dog team and wish them continued success.</paragraph>
