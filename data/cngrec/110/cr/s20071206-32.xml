    <paragraph>Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that following the prayer and the pledge tomorrow, the Senate proceed to the message from the House on <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the comprehensive Energy bill; that notwithstanding the receipt of the papers, the majority leader be immediately recognized to move to concur in the House amendment and to file cloture on that motion; that there be 20 minutes equally divided in the usual form for debate on the majority leader's motion, followed by a cloture motion  on that motion; that there be no other motions or amendments in order prior to the vote; further, that the cloture vote on the substitute amendment to the farm bill be delayed to occur at a later time, to be determined by the majority leader after consultation with the Republican leader.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, certainly the Senate is a place for squabbles. We have had lots of them. But also with the work that has to be done in this body, sometimes it takes a little debate here and there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today has been an important day for the Senate. We have been in a quorum call a lot. But during the time there were speeches being made on rare occasion here, there was a lot of work being done. The AMT is now done. I don't know that that is the case yet, but I heard that the House indicated they will accept our bill. That is quite important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been working for weeks on the farm bill. A cloture vote is set at 9 o'clock in the morning, or whatever time we agree to. Maybe we would have gotten cloture on that, I don't know. I am happy with this agreement. It will be a lot of work, but we will finish the farm bill before we leave, unless something untoward happens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has been a day of progress. Tomorrow we will finish work on the farm bill, and there will be one vote. After we do that, the two managers, Senators Harkin and Chambliss, said they will work through amendments tomorrow. There are a lot of amendments that can be agreed to. We want Senators, tomorrow and Monday--there will be no votes on Monday, but if Senators feel strongly about an amendment, work with the managers and have that offered and have that be one of the 40. Hopefully,  we can set up votes for Tuesday and finish the bill sometime before we leave here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the Energy bill, we are going to have a cloture vote in the morning. From all indications I have gotten from the minority, cloture will not be invoked. I will give a speech and others will. We would have Saturday, Sunday, and Monday to try to come up with how we are going to proceed on this matter afterward. I hope we can work something out by consent; otherwise, because of the way we have the bill, I have the authority to do certain things. I would rather do it by consent. I will do the best  I can to be as cooperative as possible with the minority. It is an extremely important piece of legislation. I think there is a mindset of everyone here to do an energy bill. The question is, what is in it? If we have a bill, will it be signed by the President?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand all of the moving parts of the bill. But we have made progress today with AMT, the farm bill, and now the Energy bill, on which we have had an agreement to move this up 1 day and not be here Saturday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For everyone who thinks we don't get a lot done, we and our staffs will be heavily involved in the matters I have outlined over the weekend. So I appreciate the cooperation of the Senators to get to the point where we are, and I feel pretty good about the day's work.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me just say I do agree with the majority leader that we made some substantial progress today. First of all, on the principle that in order to extend tax relief to one set of Americans we don't have to raise taxes on another set of Americans, all but five Members of the  Senate concurred in that approach to extension of the AMT relief. I think that is an extremely important principle to be established in the  Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to the farm bill, there is widespread agreement on both sides of the aisle that we ought to pass a farm bill and we ought to pass it as soon as possible. I think getting the consent agreement to get the amendments down to 20 on each side is a significant step in that direction. I am pleased to hear the majority leader would like for us to stay on that bill, make progress on it, and finish it before Christmas. That is certainly my view as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to the Energy bill, we understand there are two highly contentious, well-publicized provisions of tax increases that have been inserted by the House: At a time when oil is close to $100 a barrel, many of us think a tax increase is not a good idea, and the wind mandate, which is particularly onerous on those of us in the Southeast where there is not much wind, which basically means, in effect, a mandatory rate increase for utilities and for utility ratepayers all across the Southeast.  I am hopeful we can get those two items out of that bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has indicated he will veto the bill, and I think there is a view on the other side of the aisle, as well as on our side, that we would like to have an energy bill actually enacted into law; that is, signed by the President. As the majority leader has indicated, hopefully we can get those problems removed from the Energy bill next week and move toward a Presidential signature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this has been cleared by floor staff. The unanimous consent request I just entered needs a clarification. So I ask unanimous consent that it be clarified that nothing else be in order prior to the vote tomorrow morning--no points of order. I think there is a general understanding.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I just want to say that I have no objection. I wish to comment on the Energy bill. It has been a long time getting here, and it still is not finished. There are provisions of that Energy bill that, if passed, will be superb for the people of this country. It is too bad the bill is laden now with two provisions that we did not have in our bill, that we did not contemplate. We will have to work our way and see what happens. They are serious. They are serious enough  to cause the President to veto the bill. I am hopeful we will be able to find our way to get those two provisions out--the tax provision and the provision with reference to mandatory 15-percent alternative energy fuels in our States. Those two are very difficult. If we keep any of them in, our work is going to be for naught.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope everybody understands the situation. It will be an excellent bill without those provisions, and there may be a few other cleanup provisions we need in the House bill. We will work on them in the next few days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the leaders.</paragraph>
