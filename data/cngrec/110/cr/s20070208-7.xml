    <paragraph>Mr. President, I pause for a moment to pay tribute and welcome Rev. Henry Holley, our Chaplain of the day. It is a special occasion for me because this is personal. I have known Henry Holley for 30 years, his beautiful wife Betty and his daughter Debbie, who are with us today. I have known him in many ways. I would like the Senate to know, first of all, that this is a U.S. marine. For 22 years, he served the United States of America in the Marine Corps and retired in 1966, upon which  time he joined the Billy Graham organization and for the last 40 years has traveled 12 million miles to countries around the world. He leads now the Graham evangelical organization throughout the Pacific rim. His reach is so important that it is countless millions of people. One evening in  1990, in Hong Kong, Dr. Henry Holley and Dr. Graham preached the Gospel to more than 100,000 people in Asia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But he has a special reach. He has a reach around the corner and around the world. Just about any Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday in Marietta, GA, at the Caribou Coffeehouse, which has been renamed the Caribou Cathedral, Henry holds court with countless individuals in our community, celebrating the joy of our life and the belief of his faith. And this Friday or Saturday he takes off again on his third trip, third trip to Korea and to China--this year. He will travel, before this year is out, probably  a</paragraph>
    <paragraph>quarter of a million miles to countries around the world. He probably knows more leaders of business and politics, of Government and of religion than any single individual in the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an honor and a privilege for me to introduce him to the Senate, but it is a greater privilege to know him as a friend, a pastor, and a mentor.</paragraph>
