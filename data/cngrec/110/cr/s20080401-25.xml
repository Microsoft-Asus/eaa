    <paragraph>Mr. President, since his college graduation from Quincy University in 1982, Mr. Robert Dooley has been teaching high school and middle school band and vocal music at Clark County R-1 High School. Throughout his teaching career, Mr. Dooley has instructed 2,823 students in band alone at the Clark County R-1 High School. In addition, Mr. Dooley has brought together over 150 parents and volunteers to bolster the Fine Arts Booster Organization in Clark County, which has fundraised, supported,  and made possible the fine arts department in Clark County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clark County R-1 School has one of the finest music and band programs in the State of Missouri. In 2006 Mr. Dooley was named Kiwanis Club Teacher of the Year and received the Missouri Association of Rural Education Outstanding Rural Secondary Teacher of the Year Award. In June 2008, the Marching Indians will be traveling to Hawaii to march in the King Kamehameha Parade and will perform at Pearl Harbor aboard the USS Missouri. These achievements are due largely to Mr. Robert Dooley's  commitment to excellence in teaching and inspiring the young musicians in Clark County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having a strong school system is a strong asset for any community. Mr. Dooley's talents and achievements in teaching at Clark County R-1 School have added great value to the Clark County R-1 School district and the lives of the children and families in that community.</paragraph>
