  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, simply chasing higher spending with higher taxes, as the Democrats want, will fail to address the unsustainable growth of government spending. We must balance the budget without tax increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Part of the Republican plan is to make permanent the tax relief that continues to support our Nation's economic prosperity. Our pro-growth policies have worked to support our economy's solid sustained growth and have created more than 7.4 million new jobs. This growth has also fueled double-digit growth in Federal revenues and put us on a path to balancing the budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrat plan would simply reverse this progress with job-killing automatic tax increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican plan also includes reforms to unsustainable entitlement programs so they can meet the mounting challenges and obligations of the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American people elected us to find solutions, not create more problems. I urge my colleagues to work with the Republicans to implement these real and workable solutions for a more fiscally responsible tomorrow.</paragraph>
