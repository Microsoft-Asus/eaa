  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas on February 3, 2008, in Glendale, Arizona, the New York Giants achieved the improbable and upset the previously undefeated New England Patriots by a score of 17 to 14 in Super Bowl XLII to win the National Football League (NFL) Championship;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas during the 2007-2008 post season, the Giants were the epitome of determination, fortitude, and resiliency as they made their way through the playoffs and ultimately triumphed over the previously undefeated New England Patriots, who were favored by 12 points to win the championship game;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas quarterback Elisha Nelson "Eli" Manning, who had 19 completions for 255 yards and 2 touchdowns, was selected as the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl XLII;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the New York Giants' win over the New England Patriots was the most-watched Super Bowl ever, with 97,500,000 viewers, making it the second most viewed American broadcast in television history;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Giants achieved one of the most remarkable feats in sports history by winning an NFL record-breaking 11 straight road games, granting them the title of "Road Warriors", and in the process became only the second team in NFL history to win 3 playoff games and the Super Bowl away from their home field;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in each round of the playoffs, when none of the experts thought they had a chance to win, the Giants and their loyal, dedicated, and passionate fans believed they could accomplish what others declared impossible;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Tom Coughlin, in his fourth season as head coach of the Giants, has gone to the playoffs for 3 straight seasons, and this season lead his team, with the help of Defensive Coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, Offensive Coordinator Kevin Gilbride, and the entire Giants coaching staff, to Super Bowl XLII and brought the Vince Lombardi Trophy back to the Meadowlands;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the New York Giants organization is one of the most successful in NFL history, boasting 15 Hall of Fame players, appearing in 26 postseasons, winning more than 600 games, 16 NFL divisional championships, and 7 NFL championships, including remarkable title runs in 1987, 1991, and 2008 (Super Bowls XXI, XXV, and XLII) that captivated New York and New Jersey;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Giants owner and Chief Executive Officer John Mara and Executive Vice President Steve Tisch have done a remarkable job leading this storied franchise with the assistance and dedication of their talented staff;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the New York Giants have played all their home games in the Meadowlands Sports Complex, located in East Rutherford, New Jersey, since 1976 and have supported Bergen County and the northern New Jersey and New York areas with community outreach projects; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the entire Giants franchise has become a model of professionalism, teamwork, and community service in representing the entire New York and New Jersey metropolitan area: Now, therefore, be it</narrative>
  <narrative> Resolved, That the House of Representatives congratulates the National Football League champion New York Giants for winning Super Bowl XLII and completing one of the most impressive seasons in professional sports history.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400616" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues today in the consideration of <bill type="hr" number="960">H. Res. 960</bill>, which provides for the recognition of the National Football League champion New York Giants for winning Super Bowl XLII and for completing one of the most remarkable postseason runs in professional sports history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Super Bowl Sunday, I was in Columbus, Georgia. And when I realized that my flight was scheduled at the very same time as the Super Bowl, I  cancelled my return and had the privilege of watching this extraordinary game at the home of my good friend, Congressman SANFORD BISHOP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="hr" number="960">H. Res. 960</bill> was introduced by Representative STEVE ROTHMAN of New Jersey, and it has the support and cosponsorship of 60 Members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is only fitting that we consider this resolution today as it highlights and expresses our commemoration of one of sporting history's most exciting wins which occurred on February 3, 2008, when the New York Giants battled back from behind to beat the undefeated New England Patriots by a score of 17-14 to capture the NFL's coveted Lombardi Trophy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Super Bowl XLII and the perseverance of the New York Giants to become only the second team in football history to go from NFC wild card contender to NFL champion will undoubtedly go down in the record books.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For this accomplishment, we stand to commend the New York Giants franchise, players, coaches, and all of the supportive fans from across the world on a job well done. I urge the passage of this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is great fun.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="960">H. Res. 960</bill> congratulating the New York Giants for their 17-14 victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was a second straight Super Bowl victory for the first family of football, the Mannings. Peyton Manning led the Indianapolis Colts to the title last year, and his younger brother, Eli, threw two touchdown passes to lead the Giants to victory this year and claim the Most Valuable Player award, like his brother.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their father, Archie, of course, was a great pro quarterback himself, spending most of his career with the New Orleans Saints.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Wooden, the greater former UCLA basketball coach, said sports don't build character, they reveal it. So what does this victory say about the New York Giants? It says they are a resilient bunch, entering the playoffs as the number five seed in a six-team NFC field, then defeating a Dallas team who had beaten them twice in the regular season and a Green Bay team in arctic conditions to reach the big game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There, they stymied an offense that had scored more points, gained more yards, and won more games in a season than any team in NFL history. They did it by keeping that offense off the field. New York owned the ball for nearly 20 of the first 30 minutes. They did it with new heroes such as David Tyree, who scored the go-ahead touchdown. He had never caught a touchdown pass in the NFL before. And they did it with seasoned vets such as Michael Strahan who led a defense that held the Pats to a season  low of 274 yards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what was revealed of the character of these Giants? That they ignored the conventional wisdom which didn't give them a chance, that they found in each other the strength to do what they couldn't have done any other way, take down the "next big thing" in the biggest game of the year. Thanks, Giants, for showing us what is possible when we don't take "no" for an answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Rothman), the sponsor of this great legislation and a good friend of all of us.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400346" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="960">H. Res. 960</bill>, legislation to congratulate the New York Giants for winning Super Bowl XLII and completing one of the greatest upsets in professional sports history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I introduced this resolution because I am so proud of this team that plays at Giants Stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands in East Rutherford, New Jersey. My constituents and I are so honored that we have a Super Bowl champion back in our region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Sunday, February 3, in Glendale, Arizona, the New York football Giants achieved the highly improbable by beating the previously undefeated New England Patriots. The score was 17-14, and they went on to win Super Bowl XLII.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The game was the most watched Super Bowl ever with nearly 100 million viewers tuning in to make it the second-most viewed American television broadcast in history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer this resolution to honor the entire Giants organization on their incredible season and on their win. Specifically, I would like to congratulate Giants owner and chief executive officer John Mara; executive vice president Steve Tisch; head coach Tom Coughlin; defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo; offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride, and all of the Giants players and support staff on a job very well done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The entire Giants franchise has been a model of professionalism, teamwork, and community service in representing the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their Super Bowl triumph shows that no matter what the odds, a group of determined underdogs can take on a dynasty and emerge victorious. This time, the team that slew Goliath were Giants themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting House Resolution 960 and in congratulating the New York football Giants for their outstanding season and remarkable win in Super Bowl XLII.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the football Giants on their improbable and inspirational Super Bowl victory. House Resolution 960, I'm sure, will get tremendous support here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On any list of the most memorable moments in sports history, the word "underdog" often makes an appearance. We always seem to remember the team that overcame adversity, and we always remember the team that overcame doubt to steal victory from the grasp of a supposedly superior opponent in the last second, against all odds, and against all predictions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In some ways, we can all see ourselves as underdogs. Sometimes, no matter what you do, how hard you try, it can feel like the whole world is rooting for the other team and the other guy. There are lessons here of perseverance. Whether you are a candidate, whether you are a Congressman, whether you are a truck driver is immaterial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maybe this is why the Giants' upset over the heavily favored New England Patriots resonates so strongly with the American people and is sure to be remembered as one of the greatest victories in the history of the National Football League.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the start of the playoffs, no one believed the Giants would defeat the Dallas Cowboys, their flashy division rivals who had beaten them twice during the regular season, but they did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one believed that the Giants would defeat the great Green Bay Packers; but on the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field, and against a living legend, they prevailed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And no one believed the Giants could compete with New England. The Patriots were the team of destiny. Man, we've heard that on this floor about a lot of things. They had the perfect team, the perfect season to complete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only God is perfect, Mr. Speaker. Only God.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one but the Big Blue faithful believed the Giants had a chance to win that night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But history is known to repeat itself, and the history of sports is full of great upsets, victorious underdogs, from the miracle on the ice, to Buster Douglas, to Joe Namath. And now, in the same breath, we can say the 2007 football Giants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who will ever be able to forget the almost supernatural catch made by Wayne, New Jersey, resident David Tyree? Born in Montclair, went to schools there. Indeed, it was this graduate from New Jersey's Montclair High who caught a not-to-be-believed 32-yard pass from Eli Manning that kept the winning drive alive with only 59 seconds left.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the final seconds ticked off the game clock, the emotions and excitement were immeasurable. But it was a bittersweet moment for me. I wished my friend and fellow Fordham alumnus, Wellington Mara, the Giants late owner, was alive to witness it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the owners, the coaches and players of the Giants on an incredible season and a historic championship. I wish them the best of luck defending their title next year.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I don't have any speakers at this time, except I would have liked to have asked unanimous consent that former Congressman ROGER WICKER, who was a House Member who was sitting here, could speak; but given now he's a Senator, I don't think you would have found that in order. But what he said to me was how proud he is that Archie Manning, who was his classmate at Ole Miss, had these two remarkable sons in Eli and Peyton, and he thinks it reflects well, I think, on  Ole Miss, and certainly on his dad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I'd also like to express something else. For those of us who are not the sports fans that others may be, it was a tremendously proud moment for us to see the New York Giants put their best team forward in the last game of the season against the New England Patriots when the outcome of the game didn't matter to New York, but it mattered to people like me and others who feel that the obligation of pro sports is to always play their best and always put their best team forward. And I think that  remarkable game which they almost won led ultimately to the remarkable games that followed and to their ultimate victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a kick. This was a game that I'll remember the rest of my life because it had so much to do about character.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400616" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I don't have any additional speakers at this time. It's just obvious that we have some Members on this floor today who are very proud of the New York Giants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you very much for the time. I yield back the balance of my time as well.</paragraph>
