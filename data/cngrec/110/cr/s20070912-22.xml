  <narrative>SALUTING THE AUGUSTINE AND STRASSER FAMILIES -- (Senate - September 12, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11502">S11502</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I call to the attention of my colleagues three very special families from Rose Hill, IA, and their extraordinary contributions to our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, a little bit of background. As we all know, the National Guard and the Reserves have been shouldering a huge share of the combat burden in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are not only away from their families, they are also away from their employers. Bear in mind that these are citizen soldiers. In civilian life, they are teachers, firefighters, farmers, attorneys, and members of just about every other profession. And when they are deployed, their employers also have to make sacrifices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every year, the Department of Defense presents its Freedom Award to a small number of employers that go above and beyond the call of duty in supporting employees who are deployed with the Guard or Reserve. This year, one of those employers is Augustine &amp; Sons farm in Rose Hill, IA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Augustine &amp; Sons is not one of those big corporate conglomerate farms. We are talking about a family farm owned and worked by brothers Dan and Mike Augustine. They are the sixth generation of the Augustines to farm this land since it was homesteaded in 1852. They have just two employees on the farm, and one of those employees is Matthew Strasser, a first sergeant with the Iowa National Guard who is on his second deployment overseas. First Sergeant Strasser previously served in Kosovo, and he  is now deployed in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next time we see one of those bumper stickers that says, "Support Our Troops," we should think of the Augustine families. When First Sergeant Strasser left for Afghanistan, the Augustines lost one-half of their two-man workforce. But the Augustine brothers have continued to pay his entire salary, including an annual bonus. The Strasser family continues to live rent-free in a house on the farm. The Augustine families look in on the Strassers like they are just one big family--helping with  chores, taking the boys fishing, and much more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is just an extraordinary story of good, decent people going the extra mile--I should say, the extra 100 miles--to extend a helping hand and to be endlessly generous. The Augustines may have a relatively small farm, but they have very big hearts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Augustine and Strasser families are in Washington today, and the Augustines will be presented with a 2007 Freedom Award at a special dinner this evening. It was a great honor to have them at my weekly constituent breakfast this morning. I had the pleasure of meeting Dan Augustine, his wife Teresa and son Ryan; Mike Augustine, his wife Leesa, and son Caitlin; and Jessica Strasser, the wife of 1SG Matthew Strasser, and their sons Reece and Tyler.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure that the entire Senate joins me in saluting 1SG Matthew Strasser for his courageous service in Afghanistan and also for the sacrifices on the homefront by Jessica Strasser and their sons. We also are deeply grateful to the Augustine families for their generosity and their very special brand of patriotism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, Americans commemorated the anniversary of the September 11, 2007, attacks. It has always struck me that those attacks, which represented humanity at its very worst, have led to so many acts of generosity and sacrifice that represent humanity at its very best. The Augustine and Strasser families make me very proud to be an American, and it was wonderful to meet them this morning.</paragraph>
