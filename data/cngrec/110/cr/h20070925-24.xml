    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, over the last several days, the world has witnessed an incredible display of courage in the face of tyranny in Burma. Buddhist monks have been peacefully marching throughout the streets of Rangoon, as well as 25 other cities throughout the country. These pious men, revered by their countrymen, are peacefully calling for an end to the brutal military dictatorships that have held the country hostage for over four decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Citizens are beginning to stand in support of the peaceful demonstration, at times protecting the monks from possible violence from riot police by linking arms, acting as a human shield. The military junta has warned that it may take action against the protestors, action that has been terribly violent in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I stand today in solidarity with the people of Burma, who wish only for freedom and an end to the military dictatorship. And I call on the military regime to respect the will of the Burmese people to live in freedom.</paragraph>
