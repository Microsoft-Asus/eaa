  <speaking speaker="400616" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this Democratic Congress was elected to take our Nation in a new direction. We have worked to make meaningful changes for American families by passing fiscally responsible appropriations bills that fund priorities here at home, priorities neglected by the President and the previous Congresses. But every step of the way, President Bush has stood as a roadblock to the progress Americans demanded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, House Democrats worked in a bipartisan way to pass legislation authorizing the popular Children's Health Insurance Program, but the President used his veto pen to say "no" to providing health care to 10 million children. We passed the vital infrastructure bill, known as WRDA, which authorizes critical projects to protect communities across the country from natural disasters. The President again said "no." But, fortunately, our Republican colleagues joined us in overriding the  veto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, now President "No" has vetoed yet another important bill that invests in labor, health, and education priorities for our country. It is again time for House Republicans to stand with us in supporting this bipartisan legislation opposing yet another veto.</paragraph>
