  <narrative>THE SECRET RESOURCES OF INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL, CREATIVITY, AND INNOVATION -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5218]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased my friend, Mr. Boehner, made reference to the idea of "promoting our resources," a quote from Daniel Webster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is the single resource that America has, the only resource that America has that can really bring down the price of fuel and break our addiction to Middle Eastern oil? There is one secret resource that we can promote. And that is the resource of intellectual capital, creativity, and innovation. We know that just poking more holes in the ground cannot solve this problem. We have got 25 percent of the world's oil. We have 3 percent of the oil in our land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What can solve this problem is innovation, innovation like the A123 Battery Company in Boston that is going to allow us to drive electric cars, Phoenix Motorcars, Inc., that is going to have an electric car that will get 100 miles just on an electrical charge, the Sapphire Energy Company that has developed a gasoline from algae-based sources. We need to develop the resource of intellectual capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The optimists on this side of the aisle are doing that. The pessimists on this side of the aisle want to remain addicted to gasoline. That is a path that is doomed to failure. Let's be optimists and solve this problem.</paragraph>
