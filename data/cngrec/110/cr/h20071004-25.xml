    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007 reauthorizes two existing commissions and establishes three new commissions. The two existing commissions, one, the Delta Regional Commission, was created through the appropriation process, and the Northern Great Plains Regional Commission was established some time ago, but we establish three new regional economic development commissions: The Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, the Southwest Border Regional Commission, and the  Northern Border Regional Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of the regional commission approach to economic development is a recognition that economic difficulties don't stop at political dividing lines, county lines, State lines, that they transcend our political boundaries, that the economic development problems are grouped by region. By economy, if you will.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some years ago, we had the Upper Great Lakes Regional Commission linking the upper peninsula of Michigan, the upper counties of Wisconsin and the northern tier of Minnesota. They had in common forestry, wood, wood fiber industries, fisheries, travel/tourism and Great Lakes ports connected to the international economy through the St. Lawrence Seaway. Projects conceived by the Upper Great Lakes Commission were to be linked to the commonality of regional economic difficulties the three States experienced.  The same with Appalachia coal; the attendant difficulties of the coal sector of our economy stretched across State boundaries and linked the entire Appalachian region with their forestry difficulties as well and also with their need for surface transportation development. That is the principle that is extended to the three new commissions, the Southeast Crescent, the Southwest Border and the Northern Border Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Delta Regional Commission is one that has unique problems, exacerbated and at the same time underscored by the tragedy of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. All of the counties, or I should say most of the counties, and parishes in Louisiana, in that region suffered common economic problems. Creating an economic development structure on a regional basis will join the resources and the forces of these States, the counties and the parishes, to bring forth new ideas that will benefit not just  one community, not just one parish, but a commonality of parishes, a commonality of counties and a commonality of the States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this legislation, we establish a structure, a common framework for administration and management modeled after the Appalachian Regional Commission but also modeled after the difficulties we experienced in previous regional economic development commissions in the sixties and seventies and early eighties. We need standard procedures. We need a voting structure. We need standard procedures for staffing, standards that establish conditions under which conflicts of interest can be evaluated and  avoided. Commonality establishment of local economic development districts, a consistent method for distributing economic development funds, a uniform set of procedures that will apply to all of the commission, and, finally, with commonality then we can have uniform evaluation standards of the results of these commissions. And it will be the purpose of our Committee on Transportation</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400158" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007 reauthorizes two economic development commissions, the Delta Regional Commission and the Northern Great Plains Regional Commission. The bill also creates three new commissions, the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, the Southwest Border Regional Commission and the Northern Border Regional Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar and Subcommittee Chairwoman NORTON for working with me to add several counties in northwest Missouri to the Northern Great Plains Regional Commission and for working with other members of the committee to add their counties to the bill as well. I appreciate it very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Northern Great Plains Regional Commission borders my district in the north and the west. The counties added by this bill are contiguous to the counties in the commission. Additionally, these northwest Missouri counties are experiencing problems similar to the counties in the commission already, yet they have higher levels of economic distress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Northern Great Plains Regional Commission will set the stage for economic growth by creating an effective Federal-State partnership for attracting new businesses, creating new jobs and developing the infrastructure in northwest Missouri. The commission will encourage local economic development by making use of local resources for the benefit of the community. The commission is designed to successfully leverage other public and private funds, providing northwest Missouri with a very valuable  economic development tool.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Economic development plays a very vital role in maintaining our rural way of life by keeping folks in those communities and keeping that culture alive. A major component to economic development is the build-out of broadband services throughout many regions in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>No matter where you live, broadband can bring a world of opportunities and possibilities to your doorstep. It is imperative to our rural way of life that we push broadband out to every corner of the country. Where you live should not limit your opportunities for education, commerce, and medical care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many citizens in rural America's small communities do not have broadband access at a reasonable cost. It should be available to everyone no matter where they live at a reasonable rate. Through this legislation and other efforts that my colleagues and I have taken on, grants will be available to further establish an infrastructure that can support this important tool to rural economic development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, I must commend two members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Mr. Hayes and Mr. Boustany, who have been tireless advocates for their districts. I would like to recognize Mr. Hayes for his dedication to stimulating economic development and job promotion in the State of North Carolina and leading efforts to create the Southeast Crescent Authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, he has championed efforts to recruit new industry and create new jobs while sharpening the competitive proficiency of existing industries in the Eighth Congressional District of North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Boustany has also worked tirelessly to promote development and create opportunities for communities in  his district and has been a leader on the issue for the entire State of Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, thank you, Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman NORTON for working with Members and working with me to bring this legislation to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I know we have a few speakers out there, so I will cut mine short.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the very distinguished Chair of our Subcommittee on Economic Development and other subject matters, the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia who presided over the hearings and whose steady hands shaped this legislation. I am greatly appreciative of her splendid work.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the gentleman from Maine, who is a major sponsor of this bill, has a hearing. In deference to him, I will wait until after he finishes and yield my time at this time to him, if it is all right with the chairman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will then yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Maine.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400274" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman and the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007 represents a vision for economic development in our Nation that will help Americans in the most distressed regions of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the northern border region, we are seeing clearly persistent patterns of economic distress. If you look at the 36 counties that lie on the border or right next to the border between Maine and New York, you will find poverty above the national average, medium household income that is more than $6,500 below the national average, persistent unemployment through layoffs in traditional manufacturing industries, and most striking of all, a meager gain of only 0.6 percent in population between 1990  and 2000, compared to the 13 percent growth nationally over the same period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, Mr. Speaker, our mills are closing, our young people are leaving, and too many of our workers are looking for work. Clearly, this region has a common set of challenges and a compelling need for investment in new growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two days after I was elected to Congress, the very mill that I worked at for over 28 years went bankrupt, and my hometown and region were devastated. The story of my town and the mill that I worked at has been repeated across our region. That is why we need to support our regional industries and build new job opportunities, and that is why we need the investment, leadership and focus in our regional economic development bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Northern Border Commission would help the region invest in transportation, health care, agriculture, broadband, and alternative energy. It can be a partner with businesses to maintain our industry and build a new industry cluster. It can help us create jobs in the long term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have all the ingredients we need to face our challenges head-on and make our region an economic engine. This new commission will help us make the fundamental changes for our future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to once again thank the chairman and chairwoman for all their hard work on this bill. This bill is a new way to look at economic development in our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with that, hopefully our colleagues will pass this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400158" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany). He has worked tirelessly for his district. And since, not so much Hurricane Katrina, but Hurricane Rita, which devastated his district, he has been working very hard to bring some economic development to his district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield such time as he may consume for his remarks.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend, Mr. Graves, for yielding time to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill> reauthorizes the Delta Regional Authority, which works to improve the life for residents in some of the most economically distressed areas in our country. Those parishes and counties served by the DRA have per capita incomes at or far below the national average, and poverty in the region runs nearly 55 percent higher than the national rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since being created, DRA has worked to improve the economy in the delta and allowed these residents to achieve parity with the rest of the country. The key to DRA's success is its ability to foster partnerships throughout the region and to collaborate with local development districts and other Federal and State agencies to ensure maximum benefit from the dollars invested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, in an article published last year, the Economist noted: "It is creating, or helping to retain, 36,000 jobs, mostly in manufacturing, which will generate $1 billion in salaries. It has also helped 23,000 families get running water and sewage."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the aftermath, Mr. Speaker, of Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, the DRA took a leadership role in working to address many of the recovery issues facing our State of Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Oberstar, my good friend, and the leadership of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the staff, subcommittee Chairman GRAVES, my good friend, for working with me to ensure that several of the parishes in my district that were hit hardest by Hurricane Rita are included in the DRA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Data provided by the Department of Commerce shows that these parishes are now among the most economically distressed in our country, and recovery has been slow. I want to emphasize, though, that the people of southwest Louisiana are resilient, and we will rebuild and, in fact, we are rebuilding. This legislation will provide them with just yet another tool to facilitate growth and return to economic prosperity in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Again, I thank Chairman Oberstar, the Democratic staff, Chairman GRAVES, Chairman MICA and our staff. I want to thank also my legislative director, Terry Fisk, for working with me on this very important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I also want to express my great appreciation to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Graves) and admiration for the time that he devoted personally and committed to the hearings, both in the past Congress and in this Congress, and for his consolidation of the interests of the various Members on the Republican side. We really developed a very strong bipartisan initiative as a result of the gentleman's diligent efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany), who also worked within the Louisiana and Mississippi delegations, did extraordinary yeoman's work bringing disparate issues, interests and personalities together which have resulted in this successful initiative we have today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I echo the comments of our chairman, especially as regards our ranking member, Mr. Graves, who worked closely with me on this bill to ensure its profoundly bipartisan nature as counties, regardless of part of the country, regardless of who represents them, were selected based on very objective and competitive criteria. I appreciate the bipartisan support that he helped round up and the bipartisan support of so many Members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm going to ask that my full statement be in the Record, and say only a few words, first about the chairman. It needs to be mentioned where this all started. It started with the extraordinary chairman of the full committee decades ago, when he created the notion of a bill to address the most impoverished sections of the country, beginning with, of course, the classic one that everyone knows, Appalachia. All we're doing here is expanding on Mr. Oberstar's work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must say, so much that has happened in our committee is emblematic of his career. It will be hard to say what his signature bill is; but knowing him, I think he would probably want this bill to rise up among them because of who benefits, those who have least benefited from the most prosperous economy the world has ever known.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is back here by popular demand, and I use that in the technical sense of the word. The subcommittee  was besieged by Members saying, We want commissions, How come we don't have a commission, and then coming forward with statistics to show that, under the definition of persistent poverty, they now qualified. It wasn't easy to get a commission or to get in this bill, with one of the counties included in this bill. We held hearings, and we used  very objective criteria that you had to fit in order for us, after the hearings, after full study to say, yes, that county, among many in the United States that are suffering today, should have the special attention of a regional commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we think, Mr. Speaker, that as the global economy has expanded throughout our country because of all the pressures, the natural pressures that come from that and from international trade, many came forward and wanted to be included as part of these commissions. But we held to the criteria set when the Oberstar bill was first passed: there had to be systemic poverty. And the region or the county, in order to be included, had to be clearly underdeveloped relative to what was possible. And so  you had only two commissions, and then you have three added now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it comes to poverty, there is always controversy about what works. And this time we really know what works because this bill is patterned on the very successful, indeed the acclaimed, Appalachian Regional Commission. And the bill itself simply wants to make sure that administrative procedures and methods for distributing the economic development funds are uniform. When you consider that most of the funds that will flow to these regions far and away are private funds, one has to really look  at this bill as a small public investment for enormous returns in private attraction and investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to say just a word to extricate ourselves from the stereotypes about certain regions, like the northern border region which stretches from Maine to New York. We're talking about a region that some might consider in light of large cities in the region; but if you look as the commission methodology looks at counties in the region, you will understand why the northern border qualifies: few basic industries, overdependence in today's economy on agriculture, and 12.5 percent of  the population living in poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Or take the southeastern region of the United States, the Sunbelt, which everyone associates with economic growth, and well you might. But these are also the States which have historically most lagged behind the national economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so we have regions in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. And the reason we have them, of course, is that on top of industrial and technological underdevelopment, this is the region in the United States that has natural disasters at a rate of two or three times the rest of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to say that, of all of the aspects of this bill, I think that which has been embraced most by our committee is the record of private investment in the region once we designate a commission and once it begins to operate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>It really does tell us much about the "blessing of the Federal Government" and the methodology used by this commission. It tells us much about the reputation of what these commissions have done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been in Congress 16 years. I have seldom sat in hearings where people came forward not with criticisms but with glowing examples of how a specific approach to poverty in our country works. I therefore strongly recommend the bill. I commend all of those, of whom there are dozens, who had a hand in its design.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill> amends title 40, United States Code, to provide a comprehensive regional approach to economic and infrastructure development in the most severly economically distressed regions in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill> the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007, authorizes two existing comissions and three new regional economic development commissions under a common framework of administration and management, and further provides a framework for good decision making and planning. These Commissions are designed to address problems of systemic poverty and underdevelopment in their respective regions. The five commissions are: the Delta Regional Commission, the Northern Great Plains  Regional Commission, the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, the Southwest Border Regional Commission, and the Northern Border Regional Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill models the administrative and management procedures for these five Comissions after the highly successful Appalachian Regional Commission. The bill provides for a voting structure, provisions regarding staffing, conflicts of interest, local development districts, and other matters designed to produce a standard administrative framework. By providing a uniform set of procedures, this bill provides a consistent method for distributing economic development funds throughout the regions  most in need of such assistance and ensures a comprehensive regional approach to economic and infrastructure development in the most severely distressed regions in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Northern Border Regional Commission, the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, and the Southwest Border Regional Commission have been proposed in legislation introduced in this and previous Congresses and are designed to address problems of systemic poverty and underdevelopment in those regions. Additional, the Delta Regional Commission and the Northern Great Plains Commission would be reauthorized through this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill> authorizes funds for each commission to provide vital assistance for the development of our Nation's most chronically poor and distressed regions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to say of few words about the uniqueness of each of the new commissions being authorized by this bill. The Southwest border region includes all counties within 150 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. This region contains 11 counties in New Mexico, 65 counties in Texas, 10 counties in Arizona, and 7 counties in California for a combined population of approximately 29 million. According to research compiled by the Interagency Task Force on the Economic Development of the Southwest Border:  20 percent of the residents in this region of the nation live below the poverty level, unemployment rates often reach as high as five times the national unemployment rate, and a lack of adequate access to capital has created economic disparities and made it difficult for businesses to start up in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Northern border region stretching from Maine to New York, while abundant in natural resources and rich in potential, lags behind much of the Nation in its economic growth, and its people have not shared properly in the Nation's prosperity. The region's historic reliance on a few basic industries and agriculture has failed to provide a diverse enough economic base for vigorous, self-sustaining growth. In the belt of counties along the Northern border from Maine through New York, 12.5 percent  of the population lives in poverty, median household income is more than $6,500 below the national average, unemployment through layoffs in traditional manufacturing industries is persistent, and the population only grew by 0.6 percent between 1990 and 2000, while the U.S. population rose by 13.2 percent, showing significant out migration and loss of young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The southeastern portion of the United States, encompassing the states of Virgina, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida, is an area which has seen poverty rates well above the national average coupled with record unemployment. The region has also experienced natural disasters at a rate of two to three times greater than any other region of the U.S. The SouthEast Crescent Authority (SECA) authorizes a local-state-federal partnership to lift citizens in this  geographic area out of poverty and create jobs. With the federal allocation of funding, SECA seeks to funnel monies to programs which address one or more of the following criteria for community betterment: (1) infrastructure, (2) education and job training, (3) health care, (4) entrepreneurship, and (5) leadership development. Those communities with the greatest need will be targeted, and grants will be made according to the degree of distress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has broad bi-partisan support, and the Committee has held a series of hearings regarding the need for these economic development commissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the bill and urge the passage of <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McIntyre), a strong advocate for this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400266" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development  Act which provides a comprehensive regional approach to economic and infrastructure development in the most severely economically distressed part of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill includes legislation that I have introduced in every Congress since the 107th Congress that will establish the Southeast Crescent Authority for Economic Development. This authority would cover the southeastern portion of the United States, including the States of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida, which have all seen poverty rates well above the national average coupled with record unemployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar and the ranking member, Mr. Mica, as well as the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Economic Development Chairwoman ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON and the ranking member, Mr. Graves, Mr. Michaud and Mr. Hayes and my other colleagues who together have worked with us in trying to help the most economically disadvantaged areas of our country. It is their compassion, cooperation and commitment that has  brought us here today. I applaud all those who have worked together to help our areas of the country that have suffered so much. The southeastern U.S. has suffered a double whammy, the highest levels of poverty coupled with the highest levels of unemployment over the last several years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Member that represents a district from one of the southern States that has experienced stagnation in job growth, I have seen firsthand the restructuring of the South's economy. Jobs in textile and furniture-making have decreased substantially. Although a more high-tech and globally competitive economy has created new opportunities for employment in the South, it also has meant that we have lost many jobs held by employees who have few prospects for shifting to other jobs with comparable  pay. In addition, the seven States of the Southeast Crescent Authority region also have experienced natural disasters at a rate of two to three times greater than any other region in the United States, and this vulnerability to natural disasters further exacerbates the ability to recover from economic distress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Modeled primarily after the successful Appalachian Regional Commission, the Southeast Crescent Authority would enjoin a local, State and Federal partnership to lift our citizens out of poverty and give them job opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Southeast Crescent Authority would help communities by doing several things: improving infrastructure, giving the opportunity for education and job training, better health care, business entrepreneurship and leadership development. What is great about this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, is that those areas in the greatest need will be targeted. Those with the greatest need of economic distress will be helped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time indeed to change the pattern of poverty and unemployment in the southeastern United States, the only major region of the country that has never had this type of Federal focus on economic development. We are excited that we are now able to help the least of these, our brothers and sisters, who have suffered enough and suffered so much. Now we can help bolster a better opportunity for economic progress and possibility. May God bless our efforts to help those who have suffered so much  and now can see a life-changing difference in economic opportunity.</paragraph>

I just want it known that the gentleman has, from the outset, been a vigorous supporter of this legislation. His name should have been listed as  a cosponsor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for his leadership. I thank the Chair of the subcommittee, Ms. HOLMES NORTON, and I thank Mr. Graves for his good work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this commission is going to be very helpful to Vermont. We have in the northern tier of Vermont six counties, Caledonia, Grand Isle, Lamoille, Franklin, Orleans and Essex. It is among the most beautiful parts of Vermont. It has among the most industrious people in Vermont. But it has the highest unemployment rate and the lowest wages, about $10,000 below the national median. We want economic development in our northern counties. This legislation is going to give that impetus that  is going to allow our regional economic commissions that have been providing excellent leadership but on threadbare resources the opportunity to use local decisionmaking, local ingenuity and local people committed to a prosperous economy in that region to get a leg up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is tremendous about this legislation, modeled after its predecessors, is that it is a bottom-up approach. So if we have a proposal from folks in Caledonia County that broadband penetration is going to be what they need, or if we have folks in Franklin County who are going to do an agriculture-to-energy-related project, or something with dairy and that is what they need, they are going to have the opportunity for that to become a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a situation where we actually have bottom-up leadership integrated into this legislation where the Federal Government here in Washington is going to be a partner, not an impediment, to the goals, the aspirations, and the accomplishments of people back home. This bill is really about hope for the future. It is about confidence that local people in those counties in Vermont can make the best decision for themselves, and it is about Congress finally working as a partner with our local communities  and local leadership.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412220" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I thank the distinguished chairman, Mr. Oberstar, and the distinguished subcommittee chairwoman, Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton, as well as Mr. Graves for their work on this important bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill which includes the Northern Border Regional Development Commission. Parts of my home State of New Hampshire, Grafton, Sullivan and Carroll Counties, and especially in Coos County, the beautiful region known as the North Country, have taken an economic beating and are struggling to recover. A staggering number of jobs have been lost. We have seen manufacturing plants close, pulp plants disappear, and  our young people leave to places that offer more opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New Hampshire's North Country has suffered repeated economic body blows. For people who live there, it is getting harder and harder to get by. As I travel throughout my State, I speak to hardworking folks who have the drive to improve their neighborhood but who feel their communities have been ignored by the Federal Government for years. The commissions created in this bill would be charged with investing Federal resources for economic development and job creation in the most distressed counties  in New Hampshire and the ice belt region. I use the word "invest" purposely. New Hampshire is a very frugal State. We believe in small, effective Government. But we also know that a wise, effective Federal Government honors local control and invests wisely to promote opportunity and prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This commission employs a bottom-up grassroots approach that ensures that actions reflect both local needs and regional economic development goals. It also ensures that States have a deciding voice in what investment is made within their borders. The bill says that if you are willing to work hard and play by the rules, we are here to help you get ahead. That is why this bill enjoys such bipartisan support. It is an important step for many communities in New Hampshire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Chairman Oberstar, for yielding time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill>, the Regional Economic and Development Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S.-Mexico border region's economic challenges are deeply entrenched and have been overlooked by national policymakers for far too long. Throughout my district, low incomes and high unemployment have translated into a stagnant and depressed local marketplace. Many colonias along the border lack adequate water supplies and paved roads while a shortage of investment and development has limited the economic opportunities of residents throughout that region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to current challenges, the border region's population is expanding very rapidly and straining our local infrastructure. Historically, Congress has confronted regional economic challenges by creating multi-State development commissions designed to coordinate local resources and encourage cooperation between Federal, State and local governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Southwest Regional Border Commission included within this bill would represent a significant commitment by Congress to developing the economy of the Southwest. Because the challenges of this region cannot be isolated in any one city, county or State, the commission will work to stimulate the entirety of the area's economy by recognizing the connections between local economies and by coordinating the efforts of local officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By facilitating the provision of grants to States, local governments, universities, small businesses, and nonprofit entities, the commission will plant the seeds of future economic growth throughout the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By expanding the transportation, public health facilities, wastewater treatment plants and telecommunications networks, these grants will provide the border region with the infrastructure it needs to meet its current needs while preparing for the strain of an expanding population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at a time when the mounting pressures of the global economy and income disparities are causing great economic distress in the border region, the Southwest Regional Border Authority has never been more needed. I urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation, <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I want to thank the distinguished Member from Minnesota for yielding. Again, I applaud the committee's tremendous work and the work of Chairman Oberstar for the leadership and vision that he has provided, along with Chairman Reyes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill creates the Southwest Border Region Commission and will positively impact the State of Texas. Eleven out of the 12 counties that I represent will be impacted in a positive way. These counties are struggling with common infrastructure needs that inhibit the community's ability to increase economic development. Some of these communities on the U.S.-Mexico border can be identified as colonias. As you know, colonias are found in Texas, New Mexico Arizona, and California, all States that  will benefit from the establishment of the Southwest Border Regional Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These colonias many times do not have paved roads, hospitals, or even utilities. Many colonias do not have sewage systems, forcing residents to rely on often inadequate wastewater disposal methods, such as small and outdated septic tanks. These conditions often result in sewage pooling on the ground. Even if these colonias do have adequate sewage systems, the border area lacks sufficient facilities to treat wastewater in this area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, again, this Southwest Border Commission will provide the resources to help colonias and other underdeveloped regions to adequately address needs to be solved. By the establishment of this commission, this will address the basic needs that are needed in these areas. This is why I am asking the Members to support this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400158" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have heard now from folks talking about Louisiana, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, myself from Missouri; and I think folks can see that we have a lot of areas in the United States that are very economically distressed, and for various reasons. Every one of those regions, and, traditionally the Appalachia region, are distressed for different reasons. This bill allows these commissions to leverage public and private dollars. It is a great partnership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank the chairman for allowing me to add counties in northwest Missouri. It is very important to the folks there. I know he has been working on various aspects of these commissions for a long, long time. I appreciate his expertise and his willingness to be very open in this process and work with us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, again, I express my great appreciation to Mr. Mica, the ranking member of the full committee, and especially to Mr. Graves, who devoted so much time to the hearings, to the diligent effort within the committee of shaping and crafting this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the matter of adding counties that were not in the original commissions' proposals, we adhered to a very strict principle, that is, the additions had to conform with unemployment rate significantly above national average, per capita income rates that were significantly below national average rates, and out-migrations. In all cases, the counties recommended by the gentleman from Missouri, the parishes by the gentleman from Louisiana, and the gentleman from Mississippi all conformed when we  got updated census information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think we have here a splendid structure, one in which we can achieve accountability, one in which there already is success. In a report the committee received just this morning from the Delta Regional Commission on cumulative projects over the last year, the leveraging ratio is 16 to 1. That is for every $1 the commission invested in projects within the region, $16 additional in private sector and non-Federal funds have been invested. That is an extraordinary success ratio, and  we want to ensure that that success will continue and will be extended to all of the commissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time and ask for a resounding affirmative vote for this legislation.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative> Mr. Jordan of Ohio moves to recommit the bill <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill> to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure with instructions to report the same back to the House promptly with the following amendment:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At the end of the bill, add the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 7. LIMITATION ON THE USE OF FUNDS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  None of the funds authorized by this Act, including the amendments made by this Act, may be used--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) to lobby or retain a lobbyist for the purpose of influencing a Federal, State, or local governmental entity or officer; or</narrative>
  <narrative> (2) to pay for expenses related to the membership of any individual or entity in an organization or association.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412226" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work of the chairman of the committee and the ranking member. The motion to recommit that we  have in front of us is an insurance policy. It will guarantee that no funds in the bill go to lobbyists or lobbying activities. This motion, in other words, is a step towards breaking that link between legislation and lobbyists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill>, as we have heard from the language here on the floor today, is intended to aid the economic and infrastructure development in economically distressed regions of the country. Taxpayer dollars should be used for that purpose, and that purpose only.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The motion does two things: first, it prevents any of the funds authorized by this bill from being used to lobby or retain a lobbyist for the purposes of influencing a Federal, State or local government entity or officer. Second, the motion prohibits funds to pay for expenses related to the membership of an individual or entity in an organization or association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the majority promised in its opening-day rules package, section 202 of <bill type="hr" number="6">H. Res. 6</bill>, to end the K Street Project. This motion to recommit is policy that all Members should support. In fact, when this same language was offered to <bill type="h" number="569">H.R. 569</bill>, the Water Quality Investment Act, it was approved by a 425-0 vote. That same act came out of this same committee, and the full House in unanimous fashion supported this same language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit is an opportunity to improve the bill by adding explicit language to make sure that taxpayer dollars are used for their intended purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is well known, has been debated many times in this body, that a motion to recommit that uses the term "promptly" is simply a motion to kill the bill by sending it back to committee, where it will take weeks to then return it to the House floor. Why an initiative to try to kill this legislation would be offered is puzzling to me, since there was no opposition to the legislation in subcommittee, full committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, two weeks ago when the bill was debated on the suspension calendar, no one rose in opposition to the bill. There was no opposition raised to the legislation this afternoon. So the motion to recommit on the merits of the term "promptly" is clearly an effort to send it back to committee, kill the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I point out, since the gentleman offering the motion referred to initiatives by the Democratic majority to have accountability, on page 17 of the bill, section 15-306, Personal Financial Interests, conflicts of interest, we address the issue of personal conflict of interest, of integrity of personnel employed by the commission in either the Federal co-chairman's office or the State co-chairman's office, and establish very clear obligations for reporting and excluding of such activity. Furthermore,  under general Federal legislation, lobbying by a Federal Government agency of the Congress is not permitted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is a non sequitur motion. It does not accomplish anything except the purpose of sending the bill back to committee and, in effect, killing it by delay. Again, I repeat, there was no opposition registered. When the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure considered this bill in subcommittee, in full committee markup, when it came to the floor under suspension of the rules, nor was there any opposition today, why there would be a motion of this nature to kill the bill is beyond me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, there are restraints, very explicit language on personal financial interest, conflict of interest not allowed; and, in general, Federal law, Federal agencies are prohibited from retaining a lobbyist, to pay expenses for lobbying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a transparent effort to try to kill the bill rather than deal with it on its merits. So I oppose the motion to recommit with instructions.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill>, the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007. As a cosponsor of this legislation, I was disappointed when the full House failed to adopt a motion to suspend the rules and pass <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill> on September 17. That said, I am pleased that the House is reconsidering the bill today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have previously stated, <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill> is important to my constituents in Northern and Central New York because it would create the Northern Border Regional Commission to help further economic development. There is no question this assistance is needed. Specifically, in 2000, each of the counties I represent--Clinton, Essex, Franklin, Fulton, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lewis, Madison, Oneida, Oswego, and St. Lawrence--had a median household income that was below the national median of $41,994. Moreover,  seven of these counties had poverty rates in excess of the national rate of 12.4 percent, and three, Franklin, Oswego and St. Lawrence counties, had poverty rates in excess of 14 percent. Similarly, from 2004 to 2006, 8 of these counties had unemployment rates in excess of the national average.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I greatly appreciate the efforts of the Gentleman from Maine, Mr. MICHAUD, to move this measure one step closer to enactment. Since the 108th Congress, we have been working to enact legislation to create a Northern Border Regional Commission, and I look forward to working with him further to do so.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill>, the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill acknowledges a critical component of our country's success, and creates the Southwest Border Regional Commission for border counties in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I thank the committee for the inclusion of this region in the bill. I am proud to represent this region, home to one of the most vibrant communities. Where the United States and Mexico meet, it is a symbiotic community. For cities in my district, there is often a division.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many times on this house floor, the debate of the border is divisive and based on demagoguery. There is no room for those issues in today's debate. This commission is about investing in U.S. citizens that live in a unique community, a community that is the gateway to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For as much as this Congress debates and exploits immigration and constantly works to militarize our border, we could spare some time to discuss needed investment in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The residents of the southwest border are burdened with concerns that include low income, low education levels, the lowest number of health professionals, some of the highest rates of diabetes, tuberculosis, AIDS and other health crises, a lack of economic development, and the list goes on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The southwest border communities are at the periphery of the United States and Mexico's national economic and political concerns. The U.S. Government has historically forgotten this community in terms of economic development, education and social programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Southwest Border Regional Commission takes a great step to correct this misguided omission. It is our responsibility to assist our border communities and our border residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this bill and reject any attempts to further exploit the citizens who are at the gateway of this country and who sacrifice so much already to the demands of our border security.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400302" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to be a cosponsor of this bill to provide a comprehensive, regional approach to economic and infrastructure development in areas that need it the most, including South Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Southwest Regional Border Authority helps areas along the U.S.-Mexican border, which have: a 20 percent poverty rate, unemployment rates much higher than the national rate, and a lack of capital to spur business growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill offers a significant investment for federal-state partnerships to help economically distressed and underdeveloped areas that have experienced high levels of unemployment, poverty, or population loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill provides an unprecedented amount of money to develop transportation and infrastructure, provide job skills training and support business development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am personally offended--as are my constituents in South Texas--that the only infrastructure Congress has approved along the border is a wall ..... a wall that won't work and that is entirely about political expediency, not border security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Developing the South Texas infrastructure helps ensure that this region can support the trade that churns through the U.S. economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>South Texas faces a host of challenges in terms of economic development and infrastructure to support trade all along the Southwest border--and the only way to tackle it is all together, not piecemeal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in passing this bill that is important to both the border region--and the Nation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400400" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this legislation and urge my colleagues to oppose it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a strong supporter of economic development in rural America. That is why I have been pressing for reform of the Universal Service Fund to bring the benefits of broadband telecommunications to the rural areas of the country. I also strongly support the programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and our State Department of Agriculture that promote economic growth in Nebraska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, Mr. Speaker, I cannot support this bill. The State of Nebraska already participates in the existing Northern Great Plains Commission and the North Central BioEconomic Consortium. I am told by Nebraska's Deputy Director of Agriculture that there are even more of these organizations in the Midwest dedicated to the same goals. <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill> would just add one more entity to this existing number of economic development groups now in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even more troubling is the $1.25 billion price tag authorized by the bill and the creation of permanent regional commissions that will require millions of dollars in tax dollars for administrative expenses. We need to cut federal spending, not increase it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the legislation also includes a provision requiring prevailing wages under the Davis-Bacon Act. For all of these reasons, I urge a "no" vote on this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill>, the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides the opportunity for many communities along the border to receive the assistance and resources they have long needed in order for them to develop their infrastructure and economic prospects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I represent an expansive district spanning from El Paso County in far west Texas, to Dimmitt County about 550 miles south and to South San Antonio about 150 miles west. This district encompasses the longest stretch of U.S.-Mexico border of any district in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These communities along the border lack some of the most basic infrastructure including sewers, roads and health care. These mostly rural communities along the border are often too poor to take advantage of government grants and loan programs. These cities, towns and counties don't have the revenue to provide local matching funds to qualify for federal grants and programs or have the tax base to build million-dollar waste water plants on their own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A regional economic development commission on the southwest border, I believe will put the hundreds of small, rural border communities on the fast track to becoming self-sustaining and developing economically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a Southwest Border Regional Commission would essentially bring the federal government to the border. This bill will not raise taxes, will not create duplicative programs and certainly not provide any services to illegal or undocumented immigrants; this bill instead provides opportunity for our communities that are most in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to pass this bipartisan bill.</paragraph>
