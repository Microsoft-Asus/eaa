  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, I think we must be debating two different resolutions here  today. I just heard my colleague from across the aisle talk about a new plan. Of course, I guess that fits in with the smoke-and-mirror 110th Congress about a new plan. Well, if you don't want to increase the troop size, which the undemocratic majority evidently does not want to do with this resolution, and you don't want to stop the funding, then what do you want to do? You want to  stay the course. I think the American people said in the election, we don't want to stay the course.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that our military leaders, we hear this resolution when the other side talks about it, they talk about supporting our troops. And I am sure General Petraeus is confused to get approved unanimously in the Senate and hear this resolution about supporting our troops and yet we don't want to follow what he has said we need to do. General Casey agrees with this and he has been confirmed to a new position. And so how can we tell our men and women in the field that, Hey, look, we support you,  but don't listen to what your commanders have to say. We've got something different. We're going to micromanage the war from Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of the people that are going to be voting on this resolution have never been to Iraq. They have never been to Afghanistan. They have never seen some of the situations that our young men and women are put in for freedom-loving people all over this world. I don't know how they could actually vote on it if they have never been, but I guess they will. Because they are trying to paint a picture of having your cake and eating it, too. We support our troops but, look, we don't want to change our  way of what we're doing. We don't want to try to help you with more troops, to try to help you save your life over there and securing these areas that you risked your life in going in to take, knock the enemy out, and then have to leave and let the enemy come back in and be even stronger. What kind of message does that send?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not about President Bush, because I think President Bush has tried every way, Mr. Speaker, he knows how to make this a successful campaign in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he continues to come up with new ideas through the help and the advice of his military commanders to win this war on terror. This is a global war on terror. Some people from the other side seem to believe that if we pull out of Iraq that the Iraqi people are going to go back to tending sheep and herding goats. That is not  what is going to happen. If we pull out of Iraq, what is going to happen is you are going to see more bloodshed than we have seen in a long time in this world, and it is going to be the innocent Iraqi people who stuck their finger in that purple ink and went and voted for the first time in their life that are going to be the ones to suffer, the ones that said,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our men and women in uniform, those blessed souls that are in Iraq and Afghanistan and are losing their lives, they volunteered to put their lives in harm's way not only to protect our freedom in this country, not only to protect this Republic that we have but to spread freedom and democracy all across the world to every human being that loves freedom and liberty. These brave men and women need our support. They need our encouragement. But what they don't need is a smoke-and-mirror resolution  that is done for political reasons and because of political promises made on a campaign trail. They don't need that. They need real encouragement and support from this Congress. Let's do something to give them that and not do things that strengthens the enemy, discourages</paragraph>
