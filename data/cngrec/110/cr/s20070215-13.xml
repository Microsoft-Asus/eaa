  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="MARCIA MORALES HOWARD TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, we consider nominations for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench, including Judge Norman Randy Smith to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Judge Smith was nominated to a seat on the Ninth Circuit designated a judicial emergency by the Administrative Office of the Courts. Judge Smith's nomination easily could have been confirmed in the last Congress--and the emergency addressed many months ago--had the Bush administration chosen the common-sense  approach it has now followed of nominating Judge Smith--who is from Idaho--to Idaho's seat on the Ninth Circuit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, the President picked a fight by insisting on nominating Judge Smith to a California seat on the Ninth Circuit. Judge Smith had been nominated to fill the seat last occupied by Judge Stephen Trott, an appointee from California who made a personal decision to move to Idaho. I know of no precedent for shifting a circuit seat based on a judge's personal decision to change his or her personal residence. That generated opposition from the California Senators and created an impasse. I supported  the California Senators, as I had Senators Sarbanes and MIKULSKI in a similar circumstance when this President sought to fill a Maryland seat on the Fourth Circuit with someone from Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have tried for some time to get the President to redesignate the Smith nomination and nominate him to fill the Idaho vacancy. At long last, the President has done the right thing. The White House finally changed course and the President nominated Judge Smith for the Idaho seat on the Ninth Circuit. I thank the President for finally doing the right thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the cooperation of the Senators from California and the other Members of the Judiciary Committee, we were able to avoid having a hearing on Judge Smith's nomination in this Congress and to expedite his consideration, now that he has been designated for the Idaho vacancy. We were able to report Judge Smith's nomination last Thursday. Today, at long last, Senator Craig and Senator Crapo and the people of Idaho will have a judge on this important court from their home State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have worked hard since convening this Congress to make significant progress in our consideration of judicial nominations. At our first executive business meeting, the Judiciary Committee reported out five judicial nominations little more than 2 weeks after they were sent to us. Three of these were for vacancies determined by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to be judicial emergencies. All five were among those returned to the President without Senate action at the end of last year  when Republican Senators objected to proceeding with certain of the President's judicial nominees in September and December last year. All five were confirmed only 3 weeks after they were nominated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, we reported another five nominations, including the nominations we consider today. We reported nominees from the home States of Senator Specter and Senator Grassley and I want to thank Senator Casey and Senator Brown for expediting their consideration of nominees from their home States and approving them so quickly after taking office. I have worked cooperatively with Members from both sides of the aisle on our Committee, and in the Senate, to consider  quickly and report 10 judicial nominations so far this year, allowing us to fill vacancies and improve the administration of justice in our Nation's Federal courts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the five confirmations last week we have confirmed more of President Bush's nominations in the 18 months I have served as Judiciary Committee Chairman than in the more than two years when Senator Hatch chaired the Committee with a Republican Senate majority or during the entire last Congress with a Republican Senate majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With Judge Smith's confirmation today, we will have confirmed a nomination to one of the Nation's important circuit courts little more than a month after the Republicans agreed to resolution allowing the Senate to organize. That is more than the total of President Clinton's nominations to circuit court vacancies confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate during the entire 1996 session. Today, with this one confirmation we will surpass the Republican total for an entire session of the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, we also held the first judicial nominations hearing of the new Congress and considered three more nominees, two of whom are nominated to fill judicial emergency vacancies. We held that hearing on February 6. When a Republican chaired the Committee in 1999 and there was a Democratic President, the first hearing on a judicial nominee was not held until June 16. We could have postponed this hearing because it was at the same time as the Senators briefing on the new National Intelligence  Estimate about the deteriorating situation in Iraq. As I did after 9/11, and after the Senate buildings were shut down by the anthrax letters, I chose to go forward with the nominations hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know some on the other side of the aisle have tried to raise a scare since I, again, became Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. They rant as if the sky is falling and as if we would not proceed on any judicial nominations. On the contrary, we have proceeded promptly and efficiently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have long urged the President to fill vacancies with consensus nominees. After this week's confirmations, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts there will be 51 judicial vacancies, 24 of which have been deemed to be judicial emergencies. Of those 24 judicial emergency vacancies, the President has yet to send us nominees for 17 of them. That means two-thirds of the judicial emergency vacancies are without a nominee from the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will continue moving forward efficiently as long as the President sends us qualified, consensus nominees.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300050" topic="IRAQ">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, just a brief response to the distinguished majority leader about motives as to debate on Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know a Senator who has been clearer or more concise on this administration's positions on Iraq than the senior Senator from Nebraska. To suggest that some on this side are impeding or trying to protect the Bush administration's policy on Iraq, specifically escalating our military involvement in Iraq, is a bit off the mark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, the minority leader is very clear in his purpose. I have supported that. Minority rights are the essence, the foundation of this body. The minority should have an opportunity to present their resolution or resolutions. It should not be dictated to by the majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make it very clear, those on this side who have pushed for this debate are very clear in our position. I doubt if there is anyone who has been clearer than this Senator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="VOTE ON NOMINATION OF MARCIA MORALES HOWARD">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, two Senators from Florida rise to lend our support to Judge Howard, who is currently a magistrate judge and is an excellent choice. It is the privilege of Senator Martinez and myself to support the outstanding choice of Judge Howard to be a Federal district judge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Howard is a graduate of Vanderbilt University and the University of Florida Law School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make reference to a note I received from Judge Howard telling a bit about something unusual, because her parents arrived here from Cuba. This is what she writes:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My parents arrived here with very little other than an education and a willingness to work. Their success and my nomination are truly a testament to the opportunity that exists here simply by virtue of being an American. My parents never let my brother, my sister, or me forget how fortunate we were to be in a country where we could be whatever we wanted to be or that we had a duty to give back to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the kind of person who will be a successful Federal district judge.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Florida.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400621" topic="VOTE ON NOMINATION OF MARCIA MORALES HOWARD">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleague Senator Nelson in advancing the nomination of Marcia Morales Howard as a Federal district court judge for the Middle District of Florida. This outstanding woman lawyer from Florida not only has a distinguished academic background, having graduated from the University of Florida College of Law, being an editor of the Law Review there, but she also has been an accomplished litigator for 13 years with two very fine law firms  in the State of Florida, Foley &amp; Lardner and McGuireWoods. In 2003, she became a Federal magistrate. As a magistrate, she has distinguished herself in the Middle District of Florida where she would be serving as a Federal district court judge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know her and her family. I know what an outstanding American she is. I am very proud that with the magnitude of importance of a Federal appointment for a lifetime, we have someone of this competence, this dedication, and this quality to serve in this important post. I am delighted not only for the opportunity to advance the nomination but also to tell of the judicial nominating commission Senator Nelson and I have formed in the State of Florida, which I frankly believe is a model for  bipartisan cooperation and also seeking the best and most qualified on the merits by positioning the nomination before a group of distinguished lawyers who then see the applicants, study their qualifications, and make recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am delighted to urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Marcia Morales Howard for Federal district judge for the Middle District of Florida.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="VOTE ON NOMINATION OF MARCIA MORALES HOWARD">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Judge Marcia Morales Howard, nominated to the Middle District of Florida, has the bipartisan support of both Florida Senators. With valuable experience as a Federal magistrate judge and as a former civil litigator, Judge Howard is well versed in litigation matters in Federal court. Judge Howard graduated from Vanderbilt University with a B.S. in 1987, and received her J.D. with honors in 1990, from the University of Florida, College of Law, where she served as Symposium  Editor for the Florida Law Review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a litigator in private practice, Judge Howard worked mostly on complex civil litigation matters in Federal court as an Associate with the law firm of Foley and Lardner, and later worked on labor and employment law cases as an Associate, and then Partner, at the law firm of McGuireWoods, LLP. Judge Howard has also shown her dedication to serving others by providing pro bono legal services through the Jacksonville Area Legal Aid and pro bono seminars through the Jacksonville Center for Independent  Living to disabled individuals informing them of their rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand that Judge Howard is a first generation Cuban-American. She is being called upon to fill a position in one of the fastest growing areas in Florida. Senator Nelson has been a strong supporter of this nomination and has pressed for early action. I thank both Senators from Florida for their interest in this nomination. I also understand that Judge Howard's grandfather celebrated his 100th birthday just 2 weeks ago, on February 1. Her confirmation today is testimony to the great  promise that America holds for people from all parts of the world, that the granddaughter of someone who came to America can become a Federal judge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the nominee and her family on her confirmation today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, may I claim 1 minute as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think Senator Nelson and Senator Martinez had important things to say about the nominee, but I don't think anybody heard them. So if I could have the attention of my colleagues.</paragraph>
