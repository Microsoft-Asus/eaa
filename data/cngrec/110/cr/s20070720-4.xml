  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we will be in session today with speeches in morning business and Senators allowed to speak for up to 15 minutes each. Senator Dorgan, though, under an order entered last night, may speak for up to 30 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know this has been a long, hard week. We have had numerous votes. I express my appreciation for staff who have worked so hard all week--2 days in a row, and then last night we ended sometime this morning. So I appreciate very much the hard work of all the very loyal, dedicated staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be no rollcall votes today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week, I am happy to report and recognize we will have a lot to do. Monday we are going to work on another education measure, a higher education measure. There is an order that has been entered which provides for the possibility--I say possibility--of 12 first-degree amendments, and, of course, second-degree amendments. But this all must be completed within 8 hours. First-degree amendments will be limited to 30 minutes, and second-degree amendments will be limited to 15 minutes, so we are  going to, hopefully, conclude this matter on Monday. If all the amendments are not offered, it would, of course, shorten the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The two managers are Senators Kennedy and Enzi, who did such a good job on the bill yesterday, until they lost control of it with the rules we have here, which I hope--I see my friend in the Chamber, the distinguished junior Senator from Utah. I hope as one of the key members of the Rules Committee--being the ranking member of the Rules Committee--he and Senator Feinstein will look at a way we can change these rules. What went on last night was ridiculous. There is  no way to stop that unless the rules are changed, and we should change those rules. I think it can be done with the Rules Committee. We have to take a look at that. It did not help anybody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, anyway, that is what happened. But it is not going to be that way on this matter on Monday. As I said, Senators Kennedy and Enzi managed the bill very well, until it ran into the rule we have that allows unending amendments on any subject forever, literally, before you get to final passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we will have multiple votes starting at about 5:15 on Monday. Members should plan accordingly.</paragraph>
