  <speaking speaker="400436" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, along with Congresswoman Barbara Lee and Congresswoman Maxine Waters, I will be introducing the Bring the Troops Home and Iraqi Sovereignty Restoration Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill fulfills the voters' November 7 mandate to the Congress. It ends the occupation of Iraq and, at the same time, it strengthens the Iraqi government, and it also meets the needs of our returning troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will, one, bring our troops home; two, it will expedite the training of Iraqi security forces; and three, if invited by the Iraqis, work with the international community to rebuild Iraq's infrastructure, while four, fully funding the commitment we have made to our returning soldiers for full health care benefits, physical and mental.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The situation in Iraq, Mr. Speaker, gets worse every day, and it is clear that we cannot provide security to Iraqis in the middle of a civil war. We need to bring our brave and capable men and women home to safety and to their families, and we need to help the Iraqi people regain their sovereignty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush does not have a plan to bring our troops home. In fact, if anything, he is escalating this occupation with absolutely no end in sight. Our standing in the region and our standing around the world is at an all time low, and this administration has all but given up on diplomacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can no longer wait for the Commander-in-Chief to come up with a plan. We are in the fourth year of this occupation. We have waited long enough. That is why I will introduce the Bring the Troops Home and Iraqi Sovereignty Restoration Act tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether my colleagues voted to support the invasion of Iraq or not, they can now unite behind a comprehensive plan, a plan to bring peace and stability to the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most important elements of this bill is to live up to the promises made to those who have put their lives on the line for this President's fiasco in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our most solemn obligation is to the men and women who have been placed in harm's way. To fulfill our obligation, we must bring them home to their families, while, at the same time, guaranteeing physical and mental health care for all U.S. veterans of military operations in Iraq and other conflicts around the world. It is the least we can do. It is the least we can do to show the gratitude of a grateful Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to stand up for our troops, stand up for Iraqi sovereignty. Cosponsor the Bring the Troops Home and Iraqi Sovereignty Restoration Act.</paragraph>
