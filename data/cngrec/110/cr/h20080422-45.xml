    <paragraph>I'd like to follow up on the comments of my good friend from Illinois. The high cost of gasoline is troubling all Americans. $3.50 a gallon, approaching $120 a barrel. Now I just would respectfully suggest that the administration has a lot to do with this. This administration, which has a great familiarity with the oil industry, has pursued policies, including the war in Iraq, that has led to the price of oil being driven up. Even the threats on attacking Iran have at one time or  another helped to increase the cost of the price of a barrel of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is one thing that this Congress can do immediately to start to gain the American public some relief, and that is to bring a windfall profits tax forward. Enforce some discipline in the marketplace. Bring these oil companies to heel by using the power of Congress to tax the excess profits and take  that money and put it into a fund that would enable Americans to get tax breaks for the purchase of energy efficient vehicles. This is the approach we  ought to be taking.</paragraph>
