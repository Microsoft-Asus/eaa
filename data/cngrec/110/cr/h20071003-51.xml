  <narrative>NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11227]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moran) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400284" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in large and small communities across our Nation, too many Americans find themselves placed in danger by the very people who are supposed to love them. It's estimated that 2 million acts of domestic violence take place each year in the United States. This is not just a problem for women; it's also a problem for children and a problem for men. We are doing no one any favors, least of all the abusers, by ignoring the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to recognize October as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. And while we make gains in raising the awareness about domestic violence and in providing assistance to the victims, the violence continues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a recent survey in my home State of Kansas, one domestic violence act occurs every 28 minutes. One out of four women will be abused in their lifetime, and more than 3 million children will witness some form of violence at home each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Domestic violence brings fear, hopelessness and depression into the lives of every affected victim. One incident can create a cycle of despair that's difficult not only for the victim, but also for their families to overcome.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When a victim is abused, the abuse does not stay in the home, and, therefore, we cannot fight this battle only on one front. Domestic violence is often seen as a private issue. However, the suffering often follows victims at work and at school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that medical professionals, educators, law enforcement officers, and community leaders are trained to recognize the signs and symptoms of domestic violence. Everyone, not just the victim but their children who suffer and the abusers themselves, will be better off if we can put a firm and rapid stop to every single case of domestic violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also important to support domestic violence shelters. These agencies provide essential services, help advocate for victims, and spearhead efforts to increase domestic violence awareness throughout the country. Tonight I commend those who work every day to help victims of domestic violence, especially those who work in the nine service areas that I am aware of back home in Kansas in my district: Dodge City, Emporia, Garden City, Great Bend, Hays, Hutchinson, Liberal, Salina, and Ulysses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must not forget the role Congress has to play. Federal grants made under the Violence Against Women Act provide essential funds for shelter operations and support services. We must ensure that shelters and crisis centers receive sufficient funding to provide this safety net to some of our most vulnerable citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>October is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, but we must fight domestic violence and address its consequences all year long. Through education, enforcement and support, we can continue working together to break the cycle of domestic violence and bring hope to victims so terribly affected by these acts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tonight, I pray for the end of violence within our families and for the healing of those who suffer.</paragraph>
