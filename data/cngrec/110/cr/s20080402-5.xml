  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the Republican leader, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, the legislative vehicle for the housing bill, postcloture. The Republican leader and I will visit in just a few minutes. The staffs and Senators DODD and SHELBY worked through most of the night, and I think a lot of progress was made this morning. I am hopeful and confident we can get to this legislation quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have another topic about which I feel inclined to say a few words.</paragraph>
