    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent for Members to have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to congratulate the Oregon State University Beavers for their win in the 2007 National Collegiate Association Division I College World Series.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 24, 2007, Oregon State University captured its second baseball national championship in as many years by defeating the University of North Carolina Tar Heels two games to none in the best of three series. College baseball fans, student athletes, and the general public were treated to an exciting College World Series.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to extend my congratulations to the student athletes and coaches for attaining back-to-back national championships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to extend my congratulations to the University of North Carolina Tar Heels and their student athletes for a great season. The Tar Heels had a season record of 57 wins and 16 losses, and they were Atlantic Coast Conference champions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Winning back-to-back championships has brought national acclaim to Oregon State University's outstanding athletic program, and I know the fans of that university will remember this very special moment for many, many years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400070" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise also in support of House Resolution 515 congratulating Oregon State University's baseball team for winning the 2007 National Collegiate Association Division I College World Series championship for the second consecutive year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 24, 2007, the Beavers of Oregon State defeated the University of North Carolina Tar Heels by a score of 9-3, sweeping the best of three series, two games to none, to win the 2007 NCAA Division I College World Series championship. They became the first team in 10 years to win back-to-back College World Series championships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oregon State University dominated the finals of the College World Series, trailing for only one of the 45 innings they played. The Beavers of Oregon State outscored their opponents 42-16 during their remarkable run in the College World Series, becoming the first three-seed to ever win the tournament.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much of this team's success is due to Head Coach Pat Casey. After starting the year with only 23 wins and only 3 losses, the team hit a bit of a slump in May, which nearly cost them a spot in the tournament. But Coach Casey kept the team motivated and focused to help lead the Beavers to a 49-18 record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2007 World Series MVP, Jorge Reyes, a freshman, who went 2-0 with a 2.92 ERA during the College World Series, became only the fifth freshman to ever win the award in the 58-year history of the College World Series.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while we commend the college athletics department today, we should also recognize Oregon State University as an excellent academic institution. Known for its geosciences programs, which rank sixth in the Nation, the university offers over 200 undergraduate programs and more than 80 graduate programs. The campus has a renowned library and exceptional research facilities as well as great internship and study abroad programs to offer its students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my congratulations to Head Coach Pat Casey, Athletics Director Bob De Carolis, President Dr. Edward Ray, and all of the hardworking players, the fans, and Oregon State University. I am happy to represent my good friend and colleague Representative Hooley in recognizing this exceptional team in all of its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support this resolution</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to Congresswoman Darlene Hooley.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400186" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today supporting Resolution 515, congratulating the Oregon State University Beavers baseball team for winning the 2007 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I College World Series.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a representative of Oregon's Fifth Congressional District, the home of Oregon State University, it is my privilege to offer this resolution on behalf of my constituents. As a graduate of Oregon State University, it is with personal pride that I now speak on its behalf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ours is an institution set in a small town far removed from the national stage. Yet for those who have ventured there, OSU has always been a source of inspiration. We do not have the tradition of championships upon which the better-known programs of the Pacific-10 Conference have built their reputations. What we do have is a sense of self and determination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Titles have come rarely to our school. Prior to 2006 only once had a Beaver team claimed a crown, nearly 50 years having passed since then. And in that time we have had our successes, our share of All-Americans or individual champions in the Olympic sports. But such achievements all too often pass unnoticed. It is the team sports that register in our national consciousness. For us, that has been very elusive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our inspiration has not always come from championships. Our inspiration has come from the character and determination of our student athletes. It is in their perseverance that we have found the meaning of sport. Corvallis is a small town, shadowed by clouds and rain, set in the beautiful Willamette Valley. It is here these student athletes have quietly studied and trained, here they have known the same trials and tribulations as those who have come from programs lauded on the national stage,  and it is here that generations have formed a community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot bring this resolution to the floor without first mentioning the community which the 2006 and 2007 NCAA Division I baseball champions call home. These championships were won by a single team, but these team championships were not won for themselves. These championships are for the community. They are for all the student athletes of Oregon State. They are for the University, for Corvallis. They are for Oregon. Indeed, they are for Beaver Nation and the tradition it supports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the whole of Beaver Nation, on behalf of all the student athletes at Oregon State, I congratulate and thank the 2006 and 2007 Beaver baseball team for being an inspiration to all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before Coach Pat Casey took the helm of Beaver baseball, there were questions about the ability of Corvallis to draw top baseball talent away from schools of the Sun Belt. There were questions, but these questions did not come from those that knew Oregon State and Corvallis. Under Coach Casey's tutelage, the Beavers have become the latest team to take their turn at the vanguard of the PAC-10 Conference, "The Conference of Champions." The Beavers are the third PAC-10 team to win consecutive  national titles in baseball. To be sure, the Beavers have entered into an elite company as one of only five teams in the history of Division I baseball to win consecutive national titles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Beavers took their journey, as we knew they would, by virtue of the perseverance and the character that is so indicative of Oregon State. In 2005, the team entered the College World Series only to lose their first two games in the double-elimination tournament. In 2006, the team entered the College World Series to lose their first game and faced elimination in every game before starting anew in the championship series, where they won their first title, two games to one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After losing seven of nine position players and the strength of their 2006 pitching staff, the Beavers had a strong preseason in 2007 but slumped in the intra-conference competition of the PAC-10. One of the last teams to be selected for the field of 64 by the committee, the defending national champions were unseeded and undaunted. The Beavers played their way through the regional tournament and the super regional tournament to earn a berth in the College World Series for a third consecutive  year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Returning to Omaha, this team had first known loss. This team had faced elimination before victory. This team was almost not selected for the tournament. This team won five straight games against the Nation's best, won their second straight title, and now enters the annals of the one of the great teams in college baseball history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues, the Oregon State Beaver baseball team has written a storybook tale, inspiring all of us. I thank them for this, and I ask that you join with me in congratulating the 2007 Oregon State Beaver baseball team, your NCAA Division I collegiate baseball champions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues for their support</paragraph>
