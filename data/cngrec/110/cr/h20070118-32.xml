  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I just want to make a point of clarification for my friend here from Texas, insinuating and implying there was something special given to my district, American Samoa, over this minimum wage issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the gentleman should read the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. American Samoa has been subjected to the minimum wage law since 1938. So I suggest to my Republican friends, they ought to check their law and find out what the situation has been.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Northern Mariana Islands was not even in existence for the past 50 years, only until 1976. So I want to clarify that for the record. And I suggest to my friend from Texas, read the law before you start making accusations against the Speaker, insinuating and implying that her character, that she applied a double standard to the company that supposedly has been operating in my district. I suggest to my friend from Texas, read the law before you start attacking the Speaker on this matter.</paragraph>
