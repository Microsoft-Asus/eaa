  <narrative>DRILL HERE, DRILL NOW, PAY LESS -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6015]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have been informed that the rules of the House do not allow me to wear a lapel pin or a lapel sign, so I had to take this off. I was going to use this chart, but I thought, maybe, since the rules allow it, I would take this pin off and put it here so people can see what it says. It says, simply, "Drill here. Drill now. Pay less."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also symbolic of the smallness of the area that would be affected if we went offshore or if we went to ANWR. It would have to be about a pin dot here of this size to display what it would actually represent in ANWR versus all of Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Drill here in the United States. American resources. Drill now, not 20 years from now, not 30 years from now. Now. Pay less. As the futures market would look at the change in policy and would recognize that we're no longer going to hamstring ourselves, they would begin to understand that prices would not go up as fast as they have been going, and we would begin to pay less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Drill here. Drill now. Pay less for the American people.</paragraph>
