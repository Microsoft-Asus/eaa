    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, by overwhelming majorities, the American people are demanding a change of course in Iraq. After 5 years of a failed Bush administration strategy to bring peace and stability to Iraq, the American people are fed up with the way that is jeopardizing our national security, our military strength and our Nation's fiscal future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people no longer listen to the President when he says the situation in Iraq is improving. And they received more proof last week that the President's new way forward strategy, the so-called surge, is only inflaming Iraq's civil war. Casualties among U.S. forces have surged and the political process in Iraq has halted. The President's policy has produced few results on the ground, and yet he is asking both the American people and the Congress for more time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, President Bush has had 4 years to make his policy work, and the situation is not getting any better. It's time that we get back to fighting the real global war on terror so that al Qaeda does not continue to gain strength in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Senate has a chance today to follow our lead, listen to the American people and begin bringing our troops home.</paragraph>
