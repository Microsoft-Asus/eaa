    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to myself so much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of House Resolution 931, which expresses our support for naming a "race day" in America and recognizes the 50th running of the Daytona 500, which will occur on the 17th at the Daytona International Speedway in Daytona, Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Resolution 931 was introduced by my distinguished colleague, Representative TOM FEENEY of Florida, on January 17, 2008, and was considered by and reported from the House Oversight Committee on January 29, 2008, by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure, which has the support and cosponsorship of 68 Members of Congress, couldn't have been considered at a more fitting time as fans across this great country prepare for what is being called the most anticipated event in automobile racing history, the 50th running of the Daytona 500 on Saturday, February 17, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With a history dating back to February 22, 1959, the Daytona 500 at the Daytona International Speedway is a  500-mile motor sport international sweepstakes that draws the attention of millions of American racing fans and racing fans around the world every February.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Often referred to as "The Great American Race," the Daytona 500 is NASCAR's biggest, richest and most prestigious race and has been won by stock car racing greats such as Dale Earnhardt and Jeff Gordon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, given the monumental occasion of the 50th running of the Daytona 500, I think it is only appropriate that we express our support of NASCAR and "The Great American Race" by passing this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge support for this resolution designating February 17, 2008, as "Race Day in America."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next Sunday over 200,000 people from all 50 States and around the world will convene at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida, for the 50th running of "The Great American Race," the Daytona 500.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The most prestigious stock car race in the United States, the Daytona 500 is a 200-lap, 500-mile grand opening to the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Boasting the largest purse and stock car racing's most coveted trophy, the Harley J. Earl Trophy, the Daytona 500 has become the "Super Bowl of Stock Car Racing."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year millions of fans, both at home as well as those serving overseas, tune in to the race by television and radio. Since 1995, the television ratings for the Daytona 500 have been higher than any auto race, and in 2006 the race drew the sixth largest television audience of any sporting event that year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 50 years, the popularity of Daytona, and car racing in general, has grown throughout American society. I believe it is fitting that we celebrate this rising American tradition by passing this resolution in honor of the golden anniversary of its most prestigious event. I invite anybody who's free this Sunday to come to Daytona Beach and enjoy this great tradition with us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
