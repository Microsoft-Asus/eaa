    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Margo Connor, who has retired after 33 years of service to the Senate community. During the past three decades, Margo Connor has assisted in providing catering for Senate functions on Capitol Hill. In a fast-paced environment with a high turnover rate, she remained dedicated and personal, with a keen ability to establish close relationships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Margo spent 17 years in the special functions office for the former Dirksen Senate Dining Room. She compiled menus and prepared the former Senate Dining Room for functions. Meeting and interacting with many different people were her favorite aspects of her service; she was on a first-name basis with former Senators such as David Pryor, Thomas Eagleton, Gary Hart, and Jennings Randolph. Margo's commitment to providing a pleasant, comfortable, and professional environment for Senate functions resulted  in close friendships. Senator Randolph would often call her at home, making requests for a special bread with nuts on it. After returning from their honeymoon, Senator Joe Biden and his wife shared their pictures with her. Instead of calling it the Senate Dining Room, Senator Pryor referred to the Senate Dining Room as simply "Margo's Room."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After working in the Senate Dining Room, Margo took a position in the accounting office processing bids for the Senate Restaurant. Several years later, she moved to the Capitol Senator's Dining Room where she was a hostess. After working as a hostess, she worked in the Senate catering office, where she has been for the last 13 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In her years on Capitol Hill, Margo has seen a great variety of events. She hosted functions with the NFL, the Dalai Lama, and a number of other notable people. Among others, she met Paul Newman, whose suitcase she watched in the kitchen as he spoke at an event. During annual events at Union Station commemorating Columbus Day, Dr. David R. Curfman, president of the National Columbus Celebration Association, told her that she was the only one who understood what he needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Margo will miss the people she works with, whom she considers to be like family. In turn, I know she will be missed greatly by those who have had the opportunity to know and work with her. In fact, Margo has been such a presence in the Senate, and has befriended so many over the years, that it is difficult to express how much she will be missed. I am pleased to join the entire Senate community in thanking Margo for her years of service and wishing her a happy retirement.</paragraph>
