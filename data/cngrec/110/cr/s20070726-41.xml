  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, all of us in Massachusetts are proud of the Boston Celtics. The team is one of the most storied franchises in NBA history, and its players are also impressive leaders in the community. Each year, the Celtics honor outstanding persons in New England as "Heroes Among Us"--men and women who have made an especially significant impact on the lives of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The award, now in its 10th year, recognizes men and women who stand tall in service to their community. The extraordinary achievements of this year's honorees include saving lives, sacrificing for others, overcoming obstacles to achieve goals, and lifelong commitments to improving the lives of those around them. The winners include persons of all ages and all walks of life--students, community leaders, founders of nonprofit organizations, member of the clergy, and many others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At home games during the season each year, the Celtics and their fans salute the efforts of various honorees in special presentation to them on the basketball court. So far, over 500 persons have received the "Heroes Among Us" award during the past decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The award has become one of the most widely recognized honors in New England. I commend each of the honorees for the 2006 to 2007 season, and I ask unanimous consent to have their names, their achievements, and their communities printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
