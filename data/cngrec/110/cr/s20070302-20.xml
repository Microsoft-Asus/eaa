    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize and celebrate the long record of public service by an Idaho woman who has improved the financial conditions for many of my State's residents, helped our children through countless fundraising efforts and offered of herself in a distinguished record of service as an Idaho Representative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Janet Miller is well-known to many people in the Treasure Valley of Southwest Idaho, including the City of Boise. Janet is also well-known to many in this body; she assisted two of my predecessors in the U.S. Senate--Senator Jim McClure and Senator Dirk Kempthorne.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Janet and her late husband Don moved to Idaho from Utah back in 1966. They did not bring much with them except for their desire to help people. Janet was a founding member of the local charity group called Working Partners. She spent more than 20 years in fundraising efforts that brought benefit to Idaho children and other charitable efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Janet worked on behalf of the former Booth Memorial High School--now the Pritchett School--where I have had the pleasure to see the difference her efforts make in people's lives. She raised money for the local Salvation Army. She worked every Christmas to see that young children who may not have had a merry Christmas had a gift under the tree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She has been very involved in politics, having met several Presidents including her hero, Ronald Reagan. She walked the halls of Congress often and has been involved in numerous political efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Janet decided to give even more of herself when, after years of working behind the scenes, she stepped forward and ran for public office, and she won. She was the voice of Boise's Bench Neighborhood in the Idaho Legislature. She spoke often and was direct about the issues in the hearts and minds of her constituents. She sought consensus but was not afraid to speak out on what mattered most to the people she represented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Janet sought to improve the lives of unwed mothers and needy children, our environment and various social concerns. She could have sat back and let rheumatoid arthritis keep her down. But that is not the kind of person Janet is. Janet is like many of us in Idaho--independent, giving, not afraid to stand up for what is right and speak our mind when we need to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Janet is facing her final quest--to enjoy her time to the fullest with her cherished family, children and grandchildren as she fights terminal cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Janet Miller gave of herself, tirelessly, over a lifetime of public service. And now, Janet, we want to give back just a little bit. I ask Janet's accomplishments be noted here in the Record of the Congress of the United States.</paragraph>
