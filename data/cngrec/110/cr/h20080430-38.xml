    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on <bill type="hc" number="308">H. Con. Res. 308</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Concurrent Resolution 308 authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the 27th National Peace Officers' Memorial Service. Statistics from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund indicate that, in 2007, 181 officers died in the line of duty, and they will be honored at this year's memorial service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On average, in the United States a peace officer is killed every 53 hours. Sadly, these numbers make 2007 one of the deadliest years for peace officers. Five officers were women. Forty States plus the District of Columbia experienced officer fatalities in 2007; 13 States had five or more fatalities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed a proclamation which designated May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the week in which that date falls as Police Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first official Memorial Service took place on May 15, 1982, at which 91 law enforcement officers were honored. Over the past 27 years, the Memorial Service has honored over 3,000 law enforcement officers from around our Nation. Today, the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service on Capitol Hill has become one in a series of well-attended events during Police Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Activities on the Capitol Grounds conducted under <bill type="hc" number="308">H. Con. Res. 308</bill> will be coordinated with the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, will be free  and open to the public. I support this resolution and urge its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Concurrent Resolution 308 authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the annual National Peace Officers' Memorial Service to be held Thursday, May 15, 2008, as was pointed out. The National Peace Officers' Memorial Service will pay tribute to the 191 officers killed in the line of duty during 2007 and years prior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1962, this ceremony, sponsored by the Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police and its auxiliary, has honored fallen Federal, State, and local officers and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year will be the 28th time the memorial service has been held on the grounds of the Capitol. The events of National Police Week lead up to the annual Peace Officers' Memorial Service with honors for the fallen officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, National Police Week will run from Sunday, May 11, through Saturday, May 17, with events around the country and here in Washington, D.C. The families and colleagues of officers killed in duty will gather to remember and honor the men and women who protect our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the fallen officers who will be recognized this year is Deputy Sheriff Charles Cook from Missouri. Deputy Cook served the Buchanan County Sheriffs Office honorably for 3 years before his death in the line of duty. It is entirely appropriate to honor on the floor of the House the service and sacrifice of Deputy Cook and the other officers who have lost their lives serving and protecting our communities and our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The service and the other events of National Police Week are valuable reminders of the sacrifices of many of our Nation's police officers and their families. I encourage my colleagues to attend the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service, to pay tribute to the fallen officers, and recognize the individuals nationwide who put their lives at risk every day for the safety of our communities. I support the measure and would encourage my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 308, authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the 27th National Peace Officers' Memorial Service. More than 150 Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty in 2007 will be honored at this Memorial Service. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 181 officers died in the line of duty in 2007. Five officers were women. Forty States and the District  of Columbia experienced officer fatalities in 2007. Thirteen States had five or more fatalities.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hc" number="308">H. Con. Res. 308</bill>, which authorizes the use of the Capitol grounds for the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peace officers, the sworn, public-sector officers entrusted with law enforcement authority and the power of arrest, risk their lives daily to protect our nation. These individuals, who are responsible for safeguarding the rights and freedoms we enjoy as Americans, are true heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peace Officers Memorial Day honors those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for the safety and security of their communities and our nation. Created by Public Law 87-726, signed by President Kennedy in 1962, this day gives us the opportunity to acknowledge and pay our respects to those who, through their courageous deeds, have fallen in the line of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on Sunday, May 15, 2008, our nation will come together to honor, remember and record those law enforcement officers who were killed in the line of duty during the year of 2007. Mr. Speaker, one of the names of the fallen heroes added to the list last year was Officer Rodney J. Johnson of the Houston Police Department. Officer Johnson, a 12 year veteran of the Houston Police Department, was killed September 21, 2006, while taking a suspect in custody during a traffic stop. He leaves  to honor his memory his beloved wife, Houston Police Department Officer Joslyn Johnson, and five teen-age children; three daughters and two sons, ages 14 to 19.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Officer Rodney Johnson was born in Houston and served in the U.S. Army as a military police officer until being honorably discharged in 1990. He then went to work as a corrections officer for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and then as a jail attendant. He graduated from the Houston police academy in 1994.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the department's Southeast Gang Task Force, Officer Rodney Johnson earned two Lifesaving Awards and one Medal of Valor from the state of Texas. In January 1998, Officer Rodney Johnson rescued a physically challenged driver trapped in rising floodwaters in January 1998 and later that year he rescued mentally challenged people trapped inside of a burning house.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Officer Rodney Johnson, who stood 6 feet 5 inches tall and weighed nearly 300 pounds, served on his union's board of directors. As Hans Marticiuc, the president of Officer Johnson's union stated, "he was big and he was intimidating-looking, but he was as gentle as a baby bear."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the number of officers killed in the line of duty has declined in recent years, the fact that one officer is killed every two-and-a-half days in our country is a sober reminder that protecting our communities and safeguarding our democracy come at a heavy price. Last year, the total number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty was represented by 17,917 names engraved on the Memorial, representing officers from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, US territories,  and federal law enforcement and military police agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution permits the Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police and its auxiliary to sponsor a free public event, the 27th Annual National Peace Officers' Memorial Service, on the Capitol grounds on May 15, 2008. This service will honor the law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty during 2007 who have died in the line of duty, as well as the 800,000 officers who continue to serve in Federal, State and local law enforcement agencies nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important resolution.</paragraph>
