    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, soldiers don't choose to go to war. Soldiers do not allocate funds for which they use to fight the war. Soldiers may face danger, soldiers may risk their lives and sometimes lose their lives, but the least a Nation can do that sends a young person into harm's way is to fully support, fully equip and fully allow that young person to be successful to protect their own lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yet this administration has not done that. We failed in the early part of this war to provide Kevlar. This administration has failed to provide Humvees that were fully armored for our young people, and now what we see is tens of billions in backlog on maintenance so that the equipment that young people are relying on to protect their lives and to fully do their duty is unavailable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is wrong, and we must call attention to this wrong, and we must do something about it now.</paragraph>
