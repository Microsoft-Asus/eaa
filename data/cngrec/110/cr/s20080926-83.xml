  <narrative>CEDAR FALLS COMMUNITY EDUCATION -- (Senate - September 26, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9644">S9644</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in Iowa and across the United States, a new school year has begun. As you know, Iowa public schools have an excellent reputation nationwide, and Iowa students' test scores are among the highest in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take just a few minutes today to salute the dedicated teachers, administrators, and school board members in the Cedar Falls Community School District, and to report on their participation in a unique Federal partnership to repair and modernize school facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This fall marks the 10th year of the Iowa Demonstration Construction Grant Program. That is its formal name, but it is better known among educators in Iowa as the program of Harkin grants for Iowa public schools. Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 million for the State government in Iowa, which selects worthy school districts to receive these grants for a range of renovation and repair efforts everything from updating fire safety systems to building new schools or renovating  existing facilities. In many cases, this Federal funding is used to leverage public and/or private local funding, so it often has a tremendous multiplier effect in a local school district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Cedar Falls Community School District received four Harkin grants totaling $1,481,178. A 1999 grant for $393,466 which was used to help build classroom additions at Hansen Elementary and at Southdale Elementary; a 2000 grant for $487,712 which helped build Cedar Heights Elementary and a 2001 grant for $500,000 for an addition and renovations at Cedar Falls High School. These schools are the modern, state-of-the-art facilities that befit the educational ambitions and excellence of this school  district. Indeed, they are the kind of schools that every child in America deserves. The district also received a 2005 fire safety grant for $100,000 to install fire alarms systems at Peet Junior High School, Holmes Junior High School and Cedar Falls High School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. They are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a tremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned citizens. I salute the entire staff, administration, and governance in the Cedar Falls Community School District. In particular, I would like to recognize the leadership of the board of education Deon Senchina, Dr. James Kenyon, Dan Battcher, Joyce Coil, Duane Hamilton, Susan Lantz and Richard Vande  Kieft and former board members Marlene Behn and Tom Reisetter. I would also like to recognize former superintendent Dr. Dan Smith, former business manager Dr. Craig Hansel, Hansen principal Dr. Tony Reid, former high school principal Dean Dreyer, former Cedar Heights principal Chris Smith and former Southdale principal Tom Galligan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we mark the 10th anniversary of the Harkin school grant program in Iowa, I am obliged to point out that many thousands of school buildings and facilities across the United States are in dire need of renovation or replacement. In my State of Iowa alone, according to a recent study, some 79 percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. The harsh reality is that the average age of school buildings in the United States is nearly 50 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too often, our children visit ultramodern shopping malls and gleaming sports arenas on weekends, but during the week go to school in rundown or antiquated facilities. This sends exactly the wrong message to our young people about our priorities. We have to do better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am deeply grateful to the professionals and parents in the Cedar Falls Community School District. There is no question that a quality public education for every child is a top priority in that community. I salute them, and wish them a very successful new school year.</paragraph>
