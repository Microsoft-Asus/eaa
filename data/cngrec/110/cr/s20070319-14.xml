    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the life and service of Ensign Jesse LeRoy Brown, U.S. Navy. Ensign Brown was born in Hattiesburg, MS, on October 13, 1926. He enlisted in the Naval Reserve in 1946 and was appointed a midshipman, U.S. Navy, the following year. After attending Navy preflight indoctrination and flight training, he was designated a naval aviator in October 1948, the first African American to achieve this status. Midshipman Brown was then assigned to Fighter  Squadron 32. He received his commission as an Ensign in April 1949.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the Korean war, he operated from USS Leyte, flying F4U-4 Corsair fighter aircraft in support of United Nations forces. On December 4, 1950, while on a close air support mission near the Chosin Reservoir, Ensign Brown's plane was hit by enemy fire and crashed. Despite heroic efforts by other aviators, he could not be rescued and died in his aircraft. Ensign Jesse L. Brown was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his Korean war combat service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In honor of his service, the Secretary of the Navy named the 38th ship in the Knox-class of frigates the USS Jesse L. Brown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know my colleagues will join me in honoring Jesse's memory and celebrating, along with his friends, family, and fellow naval aviators, the addition of a plaque in his memory to the Naval Aviation Monument Park in Virginia Beach to be presented May 5, 2007. Ensign Brown was both a pioneer and a model of service to country, who gave his life that we might enjoy our freedom. Mr. President.</paragraph>
