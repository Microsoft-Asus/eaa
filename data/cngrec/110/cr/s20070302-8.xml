    <paragraph>Mr. President, the person about whom I am going to speak has never been on C-SPAN. Members of the public would not recognize him in any capacity. But he is a central part of the Senate family, helping make sure offices have whatever they need to function.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His name is John "Pedie" Morton. I have known him for all the time I have been in the Senate. He has been here almost 40 years, working to make the Senate a better place. His name is unfamiliar to the general public. He works behind the scenes in Capitol Facilities. He is a familiar face to those of us who walk the halls of the Capitol. We know him from his great smile, which is disarming. He always expresses warm greetings. Even though he cares a great deal about the Senate, I have to acknowledge  that he likes the Redskins more than the Senate. That is his love, the Washington Redskins. After more than three decades of work, he will be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Students learn in civics class about the hundred of us, but they don't learn how many workers it takes to keep this body running. There are hundreds of men and women just like Pedie who help us do our jobs. While the American people recognize us, the hundred Senators, today I want to recognize Pedie and the multitude of colleagues with whom he shares responsibilities in making this place work so well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are people every day, seated in front of the Presiding Officer, doing things we don't know how to do but they do to make this body function so that there is a Congressional Record every day and it is absolutely correct, the court reporters taking down every word we say. The police officers make sure the evil people who want to do harm to this beautiful building and the people in it are safe. Today, I recognize Pedie on behalf of all these people who do so much to make the Senate  the wonderful institution it is and our country a better place.</paragraph>
