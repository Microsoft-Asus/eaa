  <speaking speaker="412231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, a recent poll shows that the economy is now priority number one for the American people. With home prices continuing to fall and costs continuing to rise on everything from health care to college tuition, American families are becoming more and more pessimistic about our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it's not surprising that this poll showed that the American people trust Democrats more than Republicans to handle this issue by an 18-point margin. Since taking office earlier this year, the Democratic majority in this House has passed several pieces of legislation to assist working families during this uncertain economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We increased the minimum wage for the first time in a decade, cut loan interest rates in half, and just last week we passed an energy bill that addresses skyrocketing gas prices and will save American families up to $1,000 per year at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this Democratic Congress will continue to work on public policy measures that help American families make ends meet during this difficult economic time.</paragraph>
