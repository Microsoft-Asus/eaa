  <narrative>BROADCASTER FREEDOM ACT DISCHARGE PETITION -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11733]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. PENCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>This summer, some of the most powerful Members of Congress, the House and the Senate, advocated a return of censorship to the airwaves of America in the form of the so-called Fairness Doctrine. I, along with more than 200 of my colleagues, introduced the Broadcaster Freedom Act. It would ensure that no future President could regulate the airwaves of America without an act of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, House Republicans introduced a discharge petition to bring the Broadcaster Freedom Act to the floor of Congress. In 1 day, Madam Speaker, over 125 Members of Congress signed this petition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people should know, if 218 Members of Congress sign this petition, we can have an up-or-down vote on legislation that would keep the Fairness Doctrine from ever coming back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, if you believe in broadcast freedom, if you believe in the freedom of the press, if you believe that freedom of the press is not a partisan issue, sign the petition. Bring the Broadcaster Freedom Act to the floor of the Congress and freedom will win again in Congress.</paragraph>
