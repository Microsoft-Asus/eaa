  <narrative>HONORING BACKYARD FARMS -- (Senate - July 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9914">S9914</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to celebrate an exceptional small business from my home State of Maine that is enabling New England consumers to enjoy fresh, locally grown, and healthy tomatoes on a year-round basis. Located in Madison, Backyard Farms is a large-scale tomato producer that has invested over $20 million into what is now Maine's largest building and one of the world's most technologically advanced facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Backyard Farms, which operates the largest greenhouse in New England, employs 115 hard-working individuals who collectively yield an astonishing 1 million tomatoes per week--which adds up to 7,700 tons of tomatoes annually. With New Englanders consuming an average of 300 million fresh tomatoes per year, Backyard Farms has the potential to capture an extensive share of this market. Backyard Farms' tomatoes are certainly fresh, as it sells its product to stores less than 8 hours away. That means  that tomatoes picked one day are on store shelves all across Maine and New England the next.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to its magnificent tomatoes, Backyard Farms is striving to make its facility a green--or energy efficient--building by using the most environmentally friendly technology available. The 25-acre greenhouse uses efficient technologies including rainwater reclamation, high-efficiency boilers, and thermal blankets to produce juicy tomatoes. Furthermore, Backyard Farms utilizes natural methods to grow its wonderful produce. Bees take care of the pollination, and tomatoes are kept healthy  by implementing biological controls, such as parasitic wraps and ladybugs, rather than pesticides and fungicides. The work of those at Backyard Farms proves that conservation does not necessarily have to hinder effectiveness and efficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Backyard Farms prides itself on the quality of its product. On each box of tomatoes shipped to local stores, it is written, "wicked good tomatoes from right nearby." This motto emphasizes Backyard Farms' local nature and its commitment to the community through its highly sustainable business practices. Backyard Farms plans to build 3 to 4 additional greenhouses on at least 17 more acres. This would allow Backyard Farms to increase its produce output to include cucumbers, peppers, eggplant,  and culinary herbs. Such an expansion would have an immensely positive impact on the Maine economy by adding as many as 200 new employees. I look forward to the groundbreaking for this expansion, scheduled to occur later this month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is particularly inspirational that Backyard Farms has proven that a region known for its cooler temperatures and short growing season can in fact expand its agricultural production by combining advanced technologies with an innovative entrepreneurial spirit. Backyard Farms provides us with a paragon of smart economic development. I commend chief executive officer Peter Sellew, cofounder Arie van der Giessen, and all of the employees of  Backyard Farm  and wish them continued success and prosperity in the future.</paragraph>
