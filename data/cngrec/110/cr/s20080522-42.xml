    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today, during National Foster Care Month, to speak for the more than a half million children living in foster care across the United States who are waiting for a loving family to adopt them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage potential parents throughout our country to open their hearts, their lives and their homes to these vulnerable children and provide them with the safe, permanent families that all children deserve. As an adoptive parent myself, I know first-hand the joy and fulfillment adoption can bring to a family, and I cannot think of a more perfect gift to give a child than the love, nurturing, and protection they need to grow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A sense of stability is critical to the development of children. Yet, young children in foster care never know how long they will stay in one place or where they will be sent off to next, resulting in a frightening lack of consistency and security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recently had the chance to meet with Aaron Weaver, a young man from Nebraska, who shared with me some of his experiences in the foster care system: "Growing up in foster care, a tattered yellow vinyl suitcase always accompanied me, as I switched families, rules and routines," he said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hated that suitcase. It was a constant reminder of how unstable my life was, and how every day was uncertain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, after 6 years in Nebraska's foster care system, Aaron was finally adopted. Adoption for him meant a family who gave him unconditional love. Adoption meant the end of packing his suitcase, wondering where he would be placed next. Adoption gave him, for the first time, the freedom and confidence to think about his future not in terms of where he would be sleeping next month, but in terms of what his goals were and where he wanted to go in life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, just 10 percent of Nebraska's foster care children were lucky enough to be adopted into new families like Aaron's, leaving nearly a thousand more waiting eagerly for adoptive homes. Unfortunately, any chance of these children being placed with adoptive parents becomes worse the longer they remain in foster care. In fact, when a child reaches the 8- to 9-year age range, the probability that child will continue to wait in foster care exceeds the probability that he or she will be adopted;  and the number of children in this older age group is growing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Adoption Incentive Program, a Federal program first enacted into law as part of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, is up for reauthorization this year. This important program encourages State governments to find permanent homes for foster children through adoption by rewarding those States which have increased their number of placements. Additionally, the program provides special incentives to focus on finding homes for older foster children and those with special needs. I am proud  to report that, through this program, my home State of Nebraska was awarded $1,392,000 between 2000 and 2006 for finding adoptive families for 2,483 children, money which will be reinvested to make this number even greater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we have a responsibility to help foster children in Nebraska and across the Nation join loving, permanent adoptive families such as Aaron's. I hope all of you agree and will join me in my commitment to improving America's foster care system.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize May as National Foster Care Month. I salute the thousands of families in Kentucky and throughout the country who serve as foster parents, along with those who expand their families by adopting a child from the foster care system. Unfortunately, not every child finds a home. In 2005, more than 24,000 foster children reached their 18th birthdays without being adopted. As these young adults aged out of the foster care program, they faced many  of life's challenges without the family support and encouragement that many of us take for granted. With over a half million children currently in our Nation's foster care system, it is imperative that we do all that we can to ensure that they  are able to join the families they so desperately need and deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From my home State of Kentucky, Chris Brown is a testament to the importance of adoption. Chris entered foster care at the age of 11, after the death of his mother. He spent more than 2 years in foster care before being adopted. At the age of 13, Chris was adopted by his Big Brothers, Big Sisters mentor, Dave Brown. Chris thrived in his adoptive home, and was presented with opportunities he would not have had otherwise. Through the support of his adopted family, he was able to attend Northern  Kentucky University, where he majored in psychology. Now married and with a family of his own, Chris has dedicated his career to social work, using his talents and skills to give back to the community. Chris's story demonstrates how an investment in just one child can pay off for an entire community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The care provided by foster homes and foster families is of great value. Raising awareness about the number of foster children in America, and making it easier for families to adopt is crucial to guaranteeing that America's foster children have the resources and support they need to succeed. Chris Brown is an excellent example of how a child can thrive and develop in a loving family. National Foster Care Month reminds us of our obligation to America's youth. I commend all those who love and accept  into their homes those children needing a home.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in observance of National Foster Care Month. Throughout our Nation, so many families provide loving and caring homes for children who have suffered from abuse and neglect. This month is an important reminder to thank the families who welcome these children into their homes, as well as the State and local officials, social workers, health care workers, and others in our communities who look for signs of abuse and take action to ensure it stops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Social workers, in particular, have numerous demands placed on them in their efforts to ensure appropriate care of abused and neglected children, those with disabilities and our vulnerable elderly. To help these workers in their important jobs, I recently introduced the Dorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young Jr. Social Reinvestment Act with Senator Mikulski. I look forward to swift passage of this bill so that we can better support our Nation's social workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank those who help parents who may have a substance abuse problem or who suffer from mental illness. These important professionals help so many parents to overcome their illnesses, which can be a barrier in providing safe and stable homes for their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our justice systems, including our judges, attorneys and local law enforcement, who work every day to ensure the safety of our children, also deserve our recognition this month. So many of them take the extra time in their overburdened caseloads to ensure they are doing the right thing for the future of each abused and neglected child. In fact, in my home State of Oregon, Judge Pamela Abernethy runs a program in her courtroom that engages mental health professionals, law enforcement officials,  child development specialists and others in a team approach that has produced great outcomes for children and their parents. Her work helps to stop the cycle of abuse that we see too often in families. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Harkin to pass our bill, the Safe Babies Act, which will work to replicate successful programs like Judge Abernethy's across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, we know that often children may not be able to return to their birth families. In America we are lucky that many families, including my own, have a great love in their heart for children and are looking to adopt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oregonians Tim and Sari Gale, for example, originally were very interested in adopting an infant. However, as they continued to look into adoption, they could not get the images out of their minds of the older children they saw in the brochures. "We started to ask ourselves why we would adopt an infant, when so many children were in need of parents," said Shari. "It started making more and more sense for us to adopt an older child."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Soon, Andrew became a member of the family. "It has been heart-warming and amazing to watch the gradual process whereby this frightened little boy learned to love and to trust," observed a family friend. "Andrew has blossomed under the Gales' loving care." Watching Andrew interact with peers at high school events or serving as a counselor for other children at summer riding camp, one would never guess this likeable and polite young man had spent his early years as an abused and neglected  child. The Gales truly are a testament to the healing power of a loving family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Adoption Incentive Program, which was first enacted in 1997 as part of the Adoption and Safe Families Act, encourages States to find foster children permanent homes through adoption. The Adoption Incentive Program is due to expire on September 30. Congress must reauthorize this act so that it can continue to serve as a vitally important incentive to States for finalizing adoptions for children in foster care, with an emphasis on finding adoptive homes for special-needs children and  foster children over age 9. I am proud of Oregon's success in finalizing more than 12,700 adoptions of children from foster care between 2000 and 2006. This has resulted in Oregon receiving $3.1 million in Federal adoption incentive payments, which are invested back into the child welfare program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, roughly 2,065 children from Oregon's foster care system were adopted--but nearly 3,500 foster children in Oregon were still waiting for adoptive families, and they waited an average of about 2 1/2  years to join a new family. These vulnerable children have waited long enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, it is important that we thank foster care and adoptive families in our Nation, as well as frontline workers who protect our children, for the wonderful work that they do and love that they share.</paragraph>
