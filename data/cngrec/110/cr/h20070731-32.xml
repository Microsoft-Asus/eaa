    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, our Nation faces an increased threat of a terrorist attack, and yet, Members on both sides of the aisle are well aware of a problem with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. There is a giant loophole that handcuffs the ability of our Nation and our intelligence services to gather the information that would better protect the American people and our allies around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has known about this issue over the last 3 or 4 months, and yet the majority has refused to bring that issue to this floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage all of my colleagues to insist that before we leave here for the August district work period, that Congress deal with FISA modernization and close this terrorist loophole so we can better protect the American people.</paragraph>
