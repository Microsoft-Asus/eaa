  <narrative>ZIMBABWE -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2537]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400348" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is an issue of critical concern to the human rights movement around the world and a critical concern to the continent of Africa. And it is because tonight, I just want to report, that the country of Zimbabwe is in very, very grim and dire shape. President Robert Mugabe has plundered his country, driving it to ruin. And you know a little bit about the violence that you have seen on television over the last 72 hours. A once prosperous economy has been devastated by  misrule; inflation is running at 200,000 percent per year, and life expectancy there has been driven down to a mere 34 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was once a major agricultural exporter to the rest of Africa, but many Zimbabweans are now facing starvation because Mugabe has kicked productive farmers off his land. His regime has used food as a weapon; he rewards backers; he starves and punishes opponents. As Karl Marx said: Those who will not obey will not eat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, after 28 years of misrule, Mugabe is trying to steal the election, cracking heads to extend his reign. Defeated at the ballot box, the regime has simply refused to release official election results. And, instead, what has it done? It has stepped up its violence against the people across the countryside. It has arrested and killed its political opponents. 3,000 families have been forced from their homes. The torture chambers are full. Human rights groups report on those dead and those tortured  to death. Ominously, the regime has charged the opposition presidential candidate with treason, and we know what that means, a charge that could signal the beginning of massive violence against the majority that supported the movement for democratic change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should remember that this is the same Robert Mugabe that engineered a massacre in Southern Zimbabwe in Matabeleland in the early 1980s, and he used North Korean troops, North Korean trained troops. Those in the countryside can show you the wells, as they showed us, where those North Korean troops of the fifth brigade directed the local villagers be thrown down alive down those wells and be killed. And that spate of killing took thousands and thousands of lives across the country. So, this  is an autocrat who has stopped at nothing. And he has allies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we speak, a Chinese freighter is adrift somewhere off the western coast of Africa looking for a friendly port to unload a shipment destined for Zimbabwe. And in the hull of that ship is 3 million rounds of AK-47 ammo, 1,500 rounds of 40 millimeter rockets, 2,703 rounds of 60 millimeter mortar bombs. This cargo could quickly turn Zimbabwe into a killing field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China has played a similar role elsewhere, fueling other African violence, showing contempt for African lives. It provided the machetes to the Hutu militia to carry out its 1994 genocide. Beijing is arming the government in Sudan, which is committing genocide in Darfur with those weapons. It does this for political influence and Beijing does it for economic gain, especially oil and mineral wealth. China is currently Zimbabwe's largest investor and second largest trading partner, where it secures  much needed natural resources for China. But it is also its armory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the thing I have to reported tonight is that China is running into roadblocks, because last week South African port and truck workers refused to move this 70-ton weapons shipment to Zimbabwe. They were made aware of it by an investigative journalist. Their strike was backed by the South African union movement which said: South Africa cannot be seen to be facilitating the flow of weapons into Zimbabwe at a time when there is a political dispute and a volatile situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The spokesman was being diplomatic. South African labor has been one of the few to pointedly and vocally criticize Mugabe's tyranny. They despise the tyrant to their north and they called for an international boycott of this ship. And this is an inspiring event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the early 1970s, a labor leader at a Polish port stood up as well. Lech Walesa faced off against Soviet tyranny, demanding democracy and freedom for his native Poland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, South African port workers said they weren't going to play any role in Mugabe's next slaughter. Their action hasn't brought down a tyranny, but it may have been the beginning of one's fall. For years, Mr. Speaker, neighboring countries have set back applauding Mugabe despite the many Zimbabweans he has beaten and killed. The South African government has been an offender in this. It has even given Mugabe means of cover. President Thabo Mbeki recently called the election normal, and  denied the crisis in Zimbabwe. His government would have allowed the Chinese armed shipment to transit South Africa, but China decided to avoid the hassle at South African ports. This diplomatic support from South Africa and others has bolstered Mugabe at home. But, in the meantime, the neighbors have taken their lead. Their opposition has snowballed: Mozambique has said no. Namibia has said no. We hope tomorrow Angola says no, and sends this ship laden with its weapons back to China.</paragraph>
