  <narrative>FAILED ENERGY POLICY -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5219]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would just echo what my colleague from South Carolina said. Where is the plan?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the Democrats do not have a plan to lower energy costs for the American people, please bring some of the Republican proposals that we have already designed and which will begin to bring immediate relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other night I had a teletown hall meeting and I was listening to the people in the 19th Congressional District of Texas. One person said, Congressman, I have to drive 100 miles every day to go to my job. She said, my gasoline has gone up, but my paycheck has not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The most disturbing news was the gentleman who said, Congressman, I have to get dialysis three times a week. I have to drive 70 miles each way. He said, now I am down to trying to decide whether I am going to be able to buy food, gasoline, or the treatment for my diabetes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is time for the Democratic majority, who promised the American people a plan, to bring that plan to this House floor, instead of important legislation like we voted on yesterday, supporting the goals and ideals of the International Year of Sanitation. I know the American people are going to be very comforted that this body took up that legislation, and not energy legislation that would have brought relief for high energy costs.</paragraph>
