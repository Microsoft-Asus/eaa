  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise this morning to recognize the Reverend Elliot Foss, who is our guest Chaplain this morning. Reverend Foss is quite a unique individual. He is currently the national chaplain of the American Legion. He was appointed by Commander Martin Conaster on August 30, 2007, to that position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Foss is a retired U.S. Navy command master chief and hospital corpsman, having served in the Submarine Service. He served in the Navy during Vietnam and through the Persian Gulf war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He attended Candler Seminary and School of Ministry at Emory University in Atlanta, GA. He served as a pastor in the States of Maine, Virginia, Connecticut, Florida, and Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He currently resides in Kingsland, GA, with his wife Arlene. He is an ordained Southern Baptist minister. He is a member of American Legion Post 317 in the coastal area of Georgia, where he serves as post commander. He also has served as the Eighth District vice commander and as Post 9 commander in Brunswick, GA. He has served as the American Legion Department of Georgia chaplain for the past 7 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think in this difficult time our country is faced with right now, where we all are very cognizant of the fact that we have a number of men and women in harm's way as well as a number of veterans who have served our country so valiantly in the past, it is  very appropriate that we have the current chaplain of the American Legion in this great country of ours to stand before us and ask for blessings upon all Members of this body as well as the other leadership  from a civilian standpoint as well as a military standpoint.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Foss is a terrific individual. I happened to be with him last week in Kings Bay, GA, which is the home of a submarine fleet. We had the USS Georgia, which is a converted nuclear submarine, return to Kings Bay, where it is going to be stationed now. We had a very great ceremony on Friday of last week at Kings Bay, and Reverend Foss was very much involved in the planning for that ceremony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I say to him, thanks for coming and for extending that great blessing to us, and congratulations on serving as the national chaplain of the American Legion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. President, I yield back.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Missouri.</chair>
