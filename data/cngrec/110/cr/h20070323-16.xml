    <paragraph>$120 million for shrimp, how does that help our men and women in harm's way? $100 million for citrus growers, what does that do to help our fighting men and women? $74 million for peanut storage. That may be grand for some Washington politicians and peanut growers, but how does that help and protect our American way of life and our men and women in harm's way? $25 million for spinach. Even kids don't like spinach, but Washington politicians do, so they can take that pork-barrel  project home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But here is the kicker in this supplemental appropriations bill: Billions for livestock. That is the kicker because livestock is literally pork for pork.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the most hypocritical bill we have seen in decades here on the House floor. It is wrong for our troops in battle, but it is a great gift for Washington Democrat politicians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All the while we debate here on the floor, the Speaker of the House goes to raise money with fat cats in New York City. That is wrong for America, and the American people should know it, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
