  <narrative>
    <bill type="s" number="2146">S. 2146</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. EPA AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT DIESEL EMISSIONS REDUCTION SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (hereinafter, the "Agency") may accept (notwithstanding sections 3302 and 1301 of title 31, United States Code) diesel emissions reduction Supplemental Environmental Projects if the projects, as part of a settlement of any alleged violations of environmental law--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) protect human health or the environment;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) are related to the underlying alleged violations;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) do not constitute activities that the defendant would otherwise be legally required to perform; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) do not provide funds for the staff of the Agency or for contractors to carry out the Agency's internal operations.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT PROVISIONS.</narrative>
  <narrative> In any settlement agreement regarding alleged violations of environmental law in which a defendant agrees to perform a diesel emissions reduction Supplemental Environmental Project, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall require the defendant to include in the settlement documents a certification under penalty of law that the defendant would have agreed to perform a comparably valued, alternative project other than a diesel emissions reduction Supplemental Environmental  Project if the Administrator were precluded by law from accepting a diesel emission reduction Supplemental Environmental Project. A failure by the Administrator to include this language in such a settlement agreement shall not create a cause of action against the United States under the Clean Air Act or any other law or create a basis for overturning a settlement agreement entered into by the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3. INCLUSION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN CERTAIN STATE AND LOCAL GRANT PROGRAMS FOR DIESEL EMISSION REDUCTIONS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) In General.--Section 791 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16131) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(9) DEFINITION OF STATE.--The term `State' includes the District of Columbia.".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Conforming Amendments.--(1) Section 793(d)(2) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 16133(d)(2)) is amended by striking "Governor" and inserting "chief executive".</narrative>
  <narrative> (2) Subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 793(c)(2) of such Act are each amended by striking "50" and inserting "51" and by striking "2 percent" and inserting "1.96 percent" in each place such terms appear.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill now under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to urge the passage of <bill type="s" number="2146">S. 2146</bill>, a measure which was previously approved by the Senate. The House counterpart legislation was sponsored by our California colleague, Mr. Costa,  and has been approved by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill allows the Environmental Protection Agency to continue using supplemental environmental projects funds to retrofit existing diesel powered engines with emission reduction controls. Diesel emissions from on and off-road vehicles and engines account for more than one-half of the nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions from all mobile sources. The Environmental Protection Agency has issued regulations to limit emissions from new diesel engines and vehicles, but those rules only  apply to the new vehicles, not to the heavy duty diesel fleet that is on America's roads today. And given the long life of many diesel vehicles and engines, it's estimated that the existing fleet of vehicles will not be entirely cycled out of existence until about the year 2030.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to achieve emission reductions from that very large existing diesel fleet, a number of actions have been taken in order to retrofit those vehicles with emission reduction technologies. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency has administered the Clean School Bus Program for a number of years, providing grants to school districts across the Nation for the purpose of retrofitting diesel powered school buses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As another example, Congress has provided funding for diesel retrofits under the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program. And in addition, the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act was included as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. That Act authorizes the expenditure of $200 million annually over a 5-year period for grant and for loan programs funding diesel project retrofits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most recently, $49.2 million was appropriated by the Congress for that program as a part of the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to these programs administered by EPA, private entities have also often funded clean diesel programs as part of settlement agreements that have been reached with the Environmental Protection Agency in cases in which the agency had alleged that the private entity had committed violations of the environmental laws. These supplemental environmental projects used for diesel emission reductions have totaled $45.5 million from fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2006, and they've been  a very valuable source of obtaining emission reductions from the existing diesel fleet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as matters now stand, this very valuable tool to obtain diesel emission reductions from the older vehicles can no longer be used. The Environmental Protection Agency has concluded that because Congress appropriated funds for the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act, which is targeted toward older vehicle retrofits, supplemental environmental projects for diesel retrofits may no longer be used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That decision interprets the Miscellaneous Receipts Act, which prohibits agencies from augmenting from other sources their budgets as approved by the Congress. Because of that Act, the EPA has determined that it can no longer use private funding from case settlements to accomplish diesel retrofits since Congress has directly appropriated some funds for that purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In view of the fact that there are 10 million heavy duty diesel vehicles and other engines in use today, the continued use of supplemental environmental projects in case settlements is both cost effective and environmentally beneficial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Costa's bill would assure their continued use. The measure enjoys bipartisan support and has been endorsed by more than 45 interested organizations, including a broad range of health, environmental and industry groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure would simply grant to EPA specific authority to accept diesel emission reduction supplemental environmental projects as part of settling alleged violations of environmental laws, provided that the projects protect human health or the environment, are related to the underlying violation, do not constitute activities the defendant would otherwise legally be required to perform, and do not provide funds for the staff of the agency or contractors in order to carry out internal EPA operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Mr. Costa for his fine work in bringing this measure to the House, and I urge passage of the Senate bill which incorporates his legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400400" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of Senate bill 2146, a very commonsense based solution to dealing with older diesel technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Retrofitting simply is a cost-effective way to address the issues. It produces immediate emissions reductions and eliminates these really unnecessary infrastructure requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with that, I'm going to urge all of my colleagues to support us in this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I reserve my time, I yield to the gentleman to answer if he has any other speakers.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400043" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Costa will be speaking. He is the only other speaker which we have. After he finishes, I will be yielding back our time as well.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400400" topic="">
    <paragraph>Since they have the right to close, anyway, I'm going to yield back our time and let them wrap it up.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa). He is the author of the legislation we are considering.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400618" topic="">
    <paragraph>Congressman Boucher and Congressman Terry, I want to thank you and your staffs for the hard work that you've done with your colleagues. The Energy and Commerce Committee has made a significant difference in bringing this legislation to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure, along with its companion measure, Senate bill 2146, is, I think, very important to ensuring that we provide improved opportunities for air quality, as well as throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank my cosponsors in the House bill, which includes the original cosponsors, Congressmen Cardoza, McNerney, Congressman Nunes, as well as Representative Butterfield, Representatives HILL, Kind, Matheson, Matsui, Bono Mack, Shimkus and again Congressman Terry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure, combined with Senate 2146, will allow the Environmental Protection Agency to continue the prior practice of accepting diesel emission reduction projects as part of an environmental settlement agreement. These settlement agreements are important when you're trying to reach an accord with the private sector and still, at the same time, clean up the air.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many years the Environmental Protection Agency has funded diesel retrofit projects through the Supplemental Environment Projects, otherwise known as SEPS with the corporations as part of overall settlement agreements. From fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2006, the Environmental Protection Agency entered into diesel emission reductions with these settlement environment projects valued at over $45 million. This bill will help maintain this separate private funding source as a part of a private/public  partnership for these projects and, at the same time, improve air quality in basins throughout the country that have regional air issues that they are in noncompliance with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is particularly of importance in my own district that I share with my colleagues, Congressmen Nunes and McCarthy and Congressmen Radanovich and Cardoza, as well as McNerney. The San Joaquin Valley area is a non attainment area, and consequently, we have difficult challenges trying to become an attainment area, especially when we consider that we are one of the fastest growing regions in California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The air basin is 250 miles long, but it's shaped in a valley where you have mountain ranges on each side. Therefore, we not only have our own stationary and mobile sources of emission that we create, but because we're in the center of the transportation hub between Northern and Southern California, actually, all the way along the west coast, we have interstate transportation on 99 and Highway 5, which is no contribution of ours, but it's part of interstate transportation that contributes to the  emissions that we have to deal with. So, therefore, this is an important measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have among the highest rates of childhood asthma in the State. We  have other issues that we are continuing to deal with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, 90 percent of the commercial trucks are powered by diesel engines. Two-thirds of all farm and construction equipment run on diesel engines. Therefore, this measure can make a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>California does lead the Nation in clean diesel technology, and some of the cleanest types of diesel fuel anywhere in the world. But even retrofit projects have their role and play a significant contribution to improving air quality, not only in our district but throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, in addition, retrofitting clean diesel technologies for diesel vehicles and equipment, I think, is one of the most cost effective strategies for achieving tangible and immediate air quality benefits. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that these retrofit projects have a 13:1 benefit-to-cost ratio, meaning that the $45 million invested between 2001 and 2006 translates to over $600 million of health benefits that also benefit young people, children who have asthma cases, those  who have cardiovascular issues and the like.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to again thank my colleagues, Congressman Terry, Congressman Boucher and your staffs and all those who are cosponsors of this important measure. This is cost effective. It's meaningful. It will improve air quality throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time I want to urge all of my colleagues to support the passage of this measure.</paragraph>
