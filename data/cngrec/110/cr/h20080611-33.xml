    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the importance of using American-produced energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A new survey of 1,000 Americans nationwide conducted by American Solutions reveals that 81 percent of Americans support using American-produced energy, including the oil and coal already here, to combat the rising cost of energy and reduce dependence on foreign energy sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also shows that 69 percent of Americans support using domestic energy sources, including the oil located off our coast and in Alaska. With gasoline prices averaging $4 a gallon nationwide, now is the time to increase American-produced energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clear majorities of Americans of every political and ideological stripe advocate that the U.S. tap into its voluminous energy resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the commonsense logic of increasing production of American-produced energy and the strong support of the American people for tapping into those resources, 86 percent of House Democrats have historically voted against increasing the production of American-made oil and gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for our friends across the aisle to join with us, the 90 percent of House Republicans who have always voted to increase energy, to join with us to do this.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
