    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senator ROBERT MENENDEZ and our House colleague Congressman DONALD PAYNE in honoring Dr. William Neal Brown, a distinguished and inspiring figure in African-American history. In recognition of Black History Month, we gathered with residents of New Jersey to pay tribute to Dr. Brown on Saturday, February 10, 2007 at the Newark Museum in Newark, NJ, during "A Salute to Heroes."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Brown was born in Warrenton, GA, on February 24, 1919. His father was an ex-slave and his mother was Native American. He grew up in Aliquippa, PA, where his father labored as a farmer and steel mill worker. His love of learning and inspiration to educate others began at an early age, when he and six of his classmates dreamed of becoming teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduating with honors from high school, Dr. Brown went to work in the Civilian Conservation Corps, CCC, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's public works program that put over 3 million young men and adults to work during the Great Depression. It was here that he was introduced to the Hampton Institute, where he would enroll as a work-study student and proceed to graduate with a bachelor of science in 1941.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Brown heeded the call to serve his country and enrolled in the Army Air Force, where he served in special services as an information education officer, and trained at various bases including with the Tuskegee Airmen in Tuskegee, AL. After the war, on the GI bill, Dr. Brown began his graduate studies, first at Columbia University and then at City College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After 3 years of social work at the Veterans' Administration in Newark, NJ, Dr. Brown became the first African-American professor at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his 41 years as a professor at Rutgers, Dr. Brown mentored and inspired countless students and future social workers. He has lived his life by a verse he often quotes from Thanatopsis by William Cullen Bryant: "So live, that when thy summons comes to join the innumerable caravan that went to sway to the silent halls of death, thou go not like a quarry-slave at night, scourged to his dungeon, but sustained and soothed by an unfaltering trust. Approach thy grave as one who lies down to  pleasant dreams."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there is no doubt that Dr. William Neal Brown is an exemplary and committed leader and a true role model for our State and the entire country. I am pleased to pay tribute to him today, and I know my colleagues will join me in wishing him continued success.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, each Congress I rise to honor February as Black History Month. Each February since 1926, our Nation has recognized the contributions of Black Americans to the history of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is no accident; February is a significant month in Black American history. Abolitionist Frederick Douglass, President Abraham Lincoln, and scholar and civil rights leader W.E.B. DuBois were born in the month of February. The 15th amendment to the Constitution was ratified 136 years ago this month, preventing race discrimination in the right to vote. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was founded in February in New York City. And on February 25, 1870, this body  welcomed its first Black Senator, Hiram R. Revels of Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this important month I want to celebrate some of the contributions made by Black Americans in my home State of Oregon. Since Marcus Lopez, who sailed with Captain Robert Gray in 1788, became the first person of African descent known to set foot in Oregon, a great many Black Americans have helped shape the history of my State. This is the second time this month I have come to the floor to highlight some of their stories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. DeNorval Unthank arrived in the Portland, OR, after completing medical school at Howard University in Washington, DC. Dr. Unthank was recruited to Portland in 1929 because the city needed a Black doctor. He was quickly tested as his White neighbors greeted his first attempt to move into a previously all White residential area with broken windows, threatening phone calls, and general harassment. Dr. Unthank had to move his family four times before finding a peaceful place to settle down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the 1930s, Dr. Unthank was Portland's only Black medical practitioner. He was a dedicated doctor and a friend to any minority group in the city. Black families could not receive treatment in hospitals at that time and house calls were necessary. Dr. Unthank made himself available day and night and served African Americans, Asians, as well as many Whites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Unthank was politically active and was outspoken in his support of civil rights and equal opportunity. In 1940, Dr. Unthank was elected head of the Advisory Council, an organization that hoped to pressure local leaders into providing equal access to economic opportunities related to WWII jobs. The Council documented incidents of discrimination in the workplace around Portland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During and after World War II, Dr. Unthank worked tirelessly to build his medical practice and promote civil rights. He became the first Black member of Portland's City Club in 1943. He encouraged the club to publish a significant 1945 study called "The Negro in Portland," which opened the eyes of many citizens to ongoing discriminatory practices. Dr. Unthank also served as president of the local chapter of the NAACP and was a cofounder of the Portland Urban League. He played a strong role  in the passing of Oregon's 1953 civil rights bill, which among many issues, overturned a law banning interracial marriages in the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1958, the Oregon Medical Society named him Doctor of the Year. In recognition of his service to civil rights, grateful citizens pressed the city to dedicate DeNorval Unthank Park in North Portland in his honor in 1969. Dr. Unthank once said, "A Negro may have a few more doors closed to him and he may find them a little harder to open, but he can open them. He must keep trying."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Unthank is only one example of the Black men and women who changed the course of history in Oregon and in the United States. During the remainder of Black History Month, I will return to the floor to celebrate more Oregonians like Dr. DeNorval Unthank, whose contributions, while great, have not yet received the attention they deserve.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I rise, as many do this month, to join in the nationwide recognition of African- American history. Every February, the Nation joins in the celebration of the sacrifice, perseverance, and advancement of African Americans. The idea of an African-American history month was proposed by Dr. Carter G. Woodson, a son of former slaves. Dr. Woodson, who became a prominent scholar in African-American studies, worked tirelessly to ensure that the contribution of African Americans  would not be forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an article written for Johnson's Publications, Lerone Bennett tells us that one of the most inspiring and instructive stories in African-American history is the story of Woodson's struggle and rise from the coal mines of West Virginia to the summit of academic achievement: "At 17, the young man who was called by history to reveal Black history was an untutored coal miner. At 19, after teaching himself the fundamentals of English and arithmetic, he entered high school and mastered the four-year  curriculum in less than two years. At 22, after two-thirds of a year at Berea College [in Kentucky], he returned to the coal mines and studied Latin and Greek between trips to the mine shafts. He then went on to the University of Chicago, where he received bachelor's and master's degrees, and Harvard University, where he became the second Black to receive a doctorate in history. The rest is history--Black history."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to honor the legacy of Dr. Woodson and other African-American pioneers who led the advancement of African Americans in a nation once lacking in humanity towards them. In the spirit of honoring those legacies, I pay homage to two women, claimed by my home State of Michigan, who played pivotal roles in the struggle for civil rights and human rights. Sojourner Truth and Rosa Parks were women of different times, yet similar courage, and effectively raised awareness for the inequality  and injustice of their eras. Both have been recently honored by Congress. It was my privilege to cosponsor legislation, enacted on December 20, 2006, authorizing a bust of Sojourner Truth to be prominently displayed in the United States Capitol, and it was also my privilege to cosponsor legislation, signed</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are truly two phenomenal women, not just in African-American history, but in American History. Sojourner Truth, although unable to read and write, was widely accepted as one of the most effective spokespersons of her time. She spoke eloquently and energetically about the inhumanity and immorality of slavery. Truth also worked toward other social goals, especially women's rights. In 1851, she delivered her famous "Ain't I a Woman?" speech at the historic Women's Convention in Akron, OH.  Sojourner Truth attacked both racist and sexist notions during her speech when she said, "Then that little man in back there, he says women can't have as much rights as men, 'cause Christ wasn't a woman? Where did your Christ come from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sojourner Truth settled in Battle Creek, MI, during the mid-1850s. She traveled throughout the State during the Civil War to collect food and clothing for African-American volunteer units. Truth also traveled to Washington, DC, in 1864 to meet with President Abraham Lincoln. Truth became a close advisor to the President on assisting freed slaves. While in Washington, Truth also appeared at women's suffrage gatherings. As a result of illness, Sojourner Truth returned to Battle Creek in 1875.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born Isabella Baumfree in 1797, she died Sojourner Truth in 1883. Although she was born in chains, her legacy lives in fame. Michigan honored Sojourner Truth and her extraordinary legacy with the dedication of the Sojourner Truth Memorial Monument. Located in Battle Creek, MI, this monument was unveiled on September 25, 1999.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On November 2, 2005, I joined over 4,000 mourners at Greater Grace Temple to celebrate the life of Rosa Parks  at her funeral in Detroit, MI. Just a few days earlier, Rosa Parks became the first woman in the history of the United States to lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda. And, a few years earlier on June 15, 1999, Rosa Parks was presented with the highest honor of Congress, the Congressional Gold Medal. The actions of Rosa Parks merit such honor,  as her silent resistance to the humiliation and demoralization of racial segregation sparked the civil rights movement. Over 51 years ago in Montgomery, AL, she refused to give up her seat and move to the back of the bus. The strength and spirit of this courageous woman and her act of peaceful rebellion captured the conscience of the American people and the world. For Rosa Parks, this was but</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The boycott of the bus system in Montgomery was a direct result of Rosa Parks' actions, which sparked a movement that called attention to the plight of African Americans nationwide and introduced the world to the civil rights movement and its young leader, who would one day have a national holiday declared in his honor, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have come a long way toward achieving justice and equality for all. But we still have work to do. We must rededicate ourselves to continuing the struggle for civil rights and human rights.</paragraph>
