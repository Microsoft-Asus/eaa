    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday, January 8, was the 72nd anniversary of the birth of the King of Rock and Roll, Elvis Presley. Elvis was a Memphian, a U.S. Army veteran, and an ambassador of goodwill throughout the world through his music and movies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am here to tell you that Elvis is still alive today in spirit and is as relevant as ever. To quote The King as we proceed through the 100 hours, "It's Now Or Never" that we make the changes that America needs. When this Democratic majority finishes with the status quo, it will be "All Shook Up" because we will do the people's will so we will not be "Return(ed) to Sender." And we won't be cruel to those being paid the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, by the way, I have noticed in my office, I think we need a surge protector. Can you get one up there? Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
