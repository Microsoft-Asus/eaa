    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today is the 69th day since a great injustice took place in this country. On January 17, 2007, two U.S. Border Patrol agents entered Federal prison to begin serving 11 and 12 year sentences, respectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Agents Compean and Ramos were convicted last spring for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. These agents never should have been prosecuted. The U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted the agents and granted immunity to the drug smuggler, who claimed he was unarmed. The illegal drug smuggler received full medical care in El Paso, Texas, was permitted to return to Mexico, and is suing the Border Patrol for $5 million for violating his civil  rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, he is not an American citizen. He is a criminal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is ironic that one of the Federal prosecutors dismissed by the Justice Department, who never should have been terminated, was criticized for not doing more to try cases of illegal immigration. Yet we have a Federal prosecutor in western Texas, Johnny Sutton, who, instead of prosecuting an illegal alien, who was also a known drug smuggler, decided to give immunity to the illegal alien drug smuggler and prosecuted the two Hispanic-American border agents who tried to apprehend  the smuggler.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this makes absolutely no sense. Johnny Sutton also prosecuted another law enforcement agent, Deputy Sheriff Gilmer Hernandez. Hernandez was recently sentenced to a year in jail for shooting the tires of a car transporting illegal aliens after the driver attempted to escape a routine traffic stop by aiming the vehicle at the deputy. Hernandez was charged with violating the civil rights of one of the passengers, an illegal Mexican national, who was struck in the lip by bullet or  metal fragments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Citizens across this country and many of us in Congress want to know why does the U.S. Attorney's Office in western Texas choose to go after law enforcement officers while protecting the illegal aliens who commit crimes?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has the power to immediately reverse this injustice by granting a pardon to these two men, who were doing their jobs to protect the American people. But, so far, the President has refused to stand up for justice in this case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I hope the White House will agree with many of us in Congress who believe Mr. Sutton's actions in prosecuting these agents raises serious questions and need to be investigated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank House Judiciary Chairman JOHN CONYERS and his staff for their interest in this situation involving the two border agents, who should have been commended instead of indicted. I am hopeful that the House, under the leadership of JOHN CONYERS, will soon hold hearings to look into this injustice.</paragraph>
