  <speaking speaker="412186" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this week is Cover the Uninsured Week. This year's focus centers on expanding health care coverage for America's children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 6 years, President Bush and the Republican Congress ignored our Nation's health care crisis. As a result, the number of uninsured increased by 7 million, to 47 million Americans; 9 million of them are children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Studies show us that a child's health can be greatly improved if they have health care coverage. Children with access to health care are better prepared to learn in school and are better prepared to succeed in life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new Democratic Congress refuses to ignore America's uninsured, and that is why we passed a budget last month that provides a significant increase in funding of the SCHIP program. The $50 billion increase in funding over the next 5 years would allow us to provide health care to millions of children who are currently uninsured.</paragraph>
