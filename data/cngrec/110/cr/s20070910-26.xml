    <paragraph>Mr. President, the State of Maryland and the United States lost a brave and committed public servant last month. Former Senator Daniel Brewster, who served in this esteemed Chamber during the 1960s, died of cancer on August 19.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Few Americans have the political ancestry of Senator Brewster, who was a direct descendant of Ben Franklin and the former Attorney General for President Chester Arthur. Public service came naturally to this man, whose life and work showed his commitment to our country. He first gave to this country through his military service as a decorated war hero, wounded seven times during his service in Guam and Okinawa. Then he served as an elected official for 18 years. He served in the Maryland House  of Delegates starting in 1950, was elected to the House of Representatives in 1958 and then to the Senate in 1962.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Brewster first came to politics as an advocate for civil rights. In his own Baltimore neighborhood, neighbors complained when he invited African-American servicemen from World War II to his home. This was an outrage to him. He would never slight a person, particularly soldiers who had courageously served to defend the American flag. Senator Brewster went on to cosponsor the Civil Rights Act of 1964, forever changing the course of history in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senate Brewster represented much of what is great about public service: a desire and commitment to make this country better and stronger for every American, black and white, rich and poor, farmer and businessman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Brewster had some very trying times in his life: First, at the age of 10 when his father died; then when he was beset with personal struggles in the very public forum of public life. The lesson he left for all of us is one can rise above adversity, even in the face of trying times, and continue to serve the people of this great Nation. He did that and left this country and this Congress with a lasting legacy of accomplishments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He left another legacy quite apparent today, introducing some of our country's strongest leaders to the world of politics. House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer both started their political careers working for Senator Brewster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am personally indebted to Senator Brewster for the wisdom and advice he shared with me as a newly elected Senator. This past spring, he, along with former Senators Joe Tydings and Charles Mathias, Jr., met with me to share their insights. For this, I am forever grateful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Brewster and his wife Judy Lynn had five children: Gerry, who served in the Maryland legislature, Daniel, Jr., Dana, Danielle, and Jennilie. On behalf of the citizens of Maryland and this body, I wish to extend our sincere condolences to Senator Brewster's family. He will be missed by all.</paragraph>
