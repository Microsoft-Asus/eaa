  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge and honor a very special group, the Louisiana HonorAir. Louisiana HonorAir is a not-for-profit organization that flies as many as 200 World War II veterans up to Washington, DC, free of charge. On October 27, 2007, a group of 105 veterans and their guardians will reach Washington on this very special program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While visiting Washington, DC, the veterans will tour sights, such as the Arlington National Cemetery, the Korean Memorial, and the World War II Memorial. The program provides many veterans with their only opportunity to see the great memorials dedicated to their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus, today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring these great Americans and thanking them for their devotion and service to our Nation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
