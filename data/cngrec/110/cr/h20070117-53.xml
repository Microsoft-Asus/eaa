    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today is a sad day in the history of America. Two law enforcement officers who have given years of their life in service to this Nation have entered Federal prison today for shooting a drug smuggler.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a black mark for the President and his administration. U.S. Border Patrol agents Ramos and Compean were found guilty in a Federal court last spring for wounding a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our southern border into Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us in Congress have written letters asking the President to consider pardoning these agents, a request that is justified by serious questions about the prosecution of this case, including both the indictment and the process. These agents never should have been prosecuted for their actions last year, yet they have been sentenced to 11 years and 12 years in Federal prison respectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These agents do not deserve to spend one day in prison. By attempting to apprehend an illegal alien drug smuggler, these agents were simply doing their jobs to protect the American people. The extraordinary details surrounding the prosecution of this case assure that justice was not served. These agents should have been commended for their actions. Instead, the U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted the agents and granted full immunity to the drug smuggler for his testimony against our agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The drug smuggler received full medical care in El Paso, Texas, was permitted to return to Mexico, and is now  suing the Border Patrol for $5 million for violating his civil rights. He is not an American citizen. He is a criminal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although it is clear that the agents fired shots in self-defense, Ramos and Compean were convicted mainly on the testimony of a habitual drug smuggler who claimed he was unarmed. Despite my repeated requests for an investigation of this case and a request by more than 50 Members of Congress for the President to pardon these agents, this administration has ignored the concerns of countless citizens who have cried out against this injustice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the indifference of this White House will long be remembered by the American people and by those of us in Congress who tried to come to the aid of these two heroes.</paragraph>
