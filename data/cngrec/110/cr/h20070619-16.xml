    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, President Bush said this week that there are important differences between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to  spending, and he's right, because for 6 years, President Bush joined with Republicans that led this Congress on the most fiscally irresponsible budget policies in the history of the Nation. They turned the record surpluses of the 1990s into the record deficits we face today, and while they ran up those record  deficits, inconceivably they cut medical research. They cut Head Start, they cut clean water programs, and they cut health care for our Nation's veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Democratic budget balances the budget within 5 years, and our appropriations bills comply with pay-as-you-go scoring. We passed Homeland Security and Military Construction and Veterans appropriations bills last week, and this week we'll pass an Energy and Water bill that includes renewable fuel and reduces our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So you see, Mr. Speaker, the President's right; we do have different priorities on Federal spending.</paragraph>
