  <chair> Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to consideration of <bill type="s" number="761">S. 761</bill>, which the clerk will report.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, sometime last year, word was received that Senators Bingaman and Alexander had an idea. The idea was to do something about our country's educational slide the wrong way. I spoke to them on several occasions. They wanted to see what we could do to increase our competitiveness internationally. Their suggestion was, first, let's do a study and find out how bad it is; is it as bad as we think it is. These two fine Senators got other Senators to join with them in the idea.  They received a study from the National Academy of Sciences to find out where we were internationally with our science programs. The information was not good. As a result of that, we have the legislation now before the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is not the know-all and cure-all, but it is certainly a major step forward, if we can do this, and there is no reason we cannot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am happy and pleased to speak about the America COMPETES legislation. America COMPETES comes from the words "creating opportunities to meaningfully promote excellence in technology, education, and science," COMPETES. This is something we should do and are doing on a bipartisan basis. The bill is sponsored by both leaders and 50 Senators. That is a step in the right direction. Frankly, this is the way we used to do legislation here. There was so much that was done on a bipartisan basis. If  we are able to complete this legislation, it will allow us to move forward on other meaningful legislation dealing with this subject generally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is the result clearly of a truly bipartisan effort. This legislation has been in the making for 2 years. I said last year. Time flies by. It was the year before last that these two Senators came to me to talk about this subject. They asked the National Academy to make recommendations on steps we should take as a nation to maintain our competitive advantage. The result was the Augustine report, "Rising Above the Gathering Storm." The report warned that the Nation's traditional advantages  are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength and that decisive action is needed now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We faced a challenge such as this before, one that occurred when I was in high school. In 1957, when the Soviets launched Sputnik, there was panic and concern. That panic and concern came about from our inability to do what they were doing to maintain our technological superiority. The Soviet Union clearly was ahead of us. Our great country responded to these threats quickly. The following year Congress passed, on a bipartisan basis, the National Defense Education Act, the sole purpose of which  was to keep the United States ahead of the Soviet Union, to increase investment in math and science education. As a result of that bipartisan legislation, our country trained a whole new generation of engineers and scientists and ensured our preeminence in technology innovation for a generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, Federal investment in the basic sciences and research has long been a critical component of America's competitive dominance globally. Some economists have estimated that more than half of the country's economic growth since World War II has been a result of that technological innovation and dominance. Today, sadly, our position of dominance has been lost. We can debate where we are, but our dominance is not there--strong, of course, but dominant, no. We are challenged by emerging  countries such as India and China where national investment in basic</paragraph>
    <paragraph>research, math, and science education continues to grow at a far greater pace than in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Augustine panel cited many examples, but some statistics are striking. Consider that in 2005, more than 600,000 engineers graduated from institutions of higher education in China, 600,000; 350,000 in India; in the United States, 70,000--70,000 in the United States, 600,000 in China, and 350,000 in India. We can't keep up at that rate. China's population is more than the United States, of course, yet they graduate eight times the number of engineers even though they are only three times larger  than the United States. The report also found that American 12th graders, seniors in high school, performed below the national average for 21 countries on a general knowledge of math and science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another study cited in the report had American 15-year-olds rank 24th out of 40 countries on a math assessment. I am embarrassed to tell the Senate and everyone within the sound of my voice Nevada students ranked 43rd out of 50 States in the Nation on math assessment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As other countries become more competitive, it is clear we must refocus our energies on enhancing the Federal commitment to funding basic research in education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My mind goes back to Paul Simon. The three of us had the opportunity to serve with him. Of course, Senator Alexander served with him in different capacities when he was part of the Cabinet. He was a wonderful man, uneducated himself, no college education, wrote more than 20 books. He was a newspaper publisher when he was 19 years old. He knew that education was important, even though he was uneducated. He wrote a book called "The Tongue-Tied American," about our declining knowledge  of languages and how it was hurting us internationally. I joined with him in legislation to give summer workshop programs sponsored by the Federal Government where we could pay math and science teachers on an elementary and secondary level so they could make</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The America COMPETES Act addresses concerns of Paul Simon and the National Science Foundation. It is in effect a downpayment, a very modest first step in ensuring that America retains its competitive edge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my appreciation to Senators Bingaman and Alexander for authorizing the academy study. This study, along with a number of recent reports and books, brought a much needed sense of urgency to this issue. There are also chairmen and ranking members of committees who have expressed an interest in and support of what we are doing. Senators Inouye, Stevens, Kennedy, Enzi, Lieberman, Ensign, Mikulski, Hutchison,  and Nelson of Florida have been instrumental in crafting this legislation. This legislation will double the Federal investment for the National Science Foundation over the next 4 years and for the Office of Science at the Department of Energy over the next decade. I personally think it should be more than five. I am happy if we can do this. I hope we can. I am confident we can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill provides grants to States in order to better align elementary and secondary school curriculum with the knowledge and skills needed for the global economy. Nevada has a program recognizing where we are in the overall scheme.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is called a P-16 Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Federal legislation we have introduced and are considering now will also strengthen our math and science teaching workforce--that was Paul Simon's dream--by recruiting and training teachers to teach in high-need schools and help improve math instruction at the elementary and middle school level, through Math Now grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest to the two authors and the two managers of this bill we go back and look at the idea Senator Simon had--and I joined with him--that we have summer workshop programs sponsored by the Federal Government for elementary and secondary teachers so they can update their math and science skills, get paid for doing that, and stay teaching. We have such a shortage of math and science teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the high school level, we have far fewer physics teachers than we have schools. Of course, the other reason for doing this is, with the collective bargaining agreements--I support them, and we have them in many of our schools, in most of our school districts--it makes it very difficult to pay math or science teachers more than you can pay a PE teacher. This summer workshop program would allow that to take place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope that is something Senator Alexander and Senator Bingaman will look at and see if we can come up with that. It is not only important to produce these math and science teachers but to keep them in the schools also.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America COMPETES will expand important advanced placement and international baccalaureate, IB, programs by increasing the number of math, science, and foreign languages AP and IB courses and preparing more teachers to teach these challenging courses. This is essential for all States. But take, again, Nevada, where only 6 percent of 12th graders took the AP calculus exam and only 7 percent took the AP science exam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If signed into law, our bill will do much of what the Augustine Report recommended, but the truth is, in years to come we will have to do even more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although we make new and significant investments in research, we still must address our tax structure and make sure we do as much as possible to encourage investment in research and development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1844, this Congress was approached by an individual who said he had a great idea. He could not raise the money in the private sector, but he had an idea that would revolutionize the communications of this country, and in 1844 Congress appropriated $40,000 for a man to build a telegraph line between Washington, DC, and Baltimore, MD.&#xD0;It revolutionized--revolutionized--the communication industry, the telegraph.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government is going to have to understand there are times when we have to advance moneys for research and development that cannot come from the private sector. I hope we will look to do it. We should start by finally making the R&amp;D tax credit permanent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must also do more in education. The bill strengthens educational opportunities in science, technology, engineering, math, and critical foreign languages, but this, again, is a first step--but it is a big first step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an example, we must take a very hard look at our high schools. As Bill Gates has said, and often, our high schools were designed for a 20th century economy and often do not address the needs of the 21st century workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill Gates and Melinda Gates now are giving money to schools, school districts, but they have a lot of strings on it. For example, recently they gave money to a New York school district, with this proviso: You can only use this money if you are going to make your schools smaller.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevada, again--we have high schools in Nevada that have more than 5,000 students. How in the world can students learn well--and try to make that basketball team--with 5,000 students? Some of the schools are not that big now, but we have many schools in southern Nevada that have over 3,000 students. So the Gates recognize this. We have to recognize this also as part of our problem. The average school in America is about 50 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should also realize that unless our most basic commitments to America's students are met--by properly funding title I and No Child Left Behind and making a college education accessible and affordable--these efforts alone in this bill cannot prepare our students for the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American COMPETES Act is a tremendously important step in maintaining this Nation's competitive advantage. I look forward to doing whatever I can to make this legislation a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I express my appreciation to the Republican leader for joining in this legislation. This is something he and I have talked about now for 3 months since we have assumed our roles in this 110th Congress. We are going to work to make sure this legislation goes forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to everyone within the sound of my voice, for this legislation there is going to be no cloture motion filed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are either going to do this or not do it. This is something we need to do. We need to prove we can do things on a bipartisan basis. And if we cannot do this, Mr. President, we are in real trouble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope we can move forward on this legislation. I hope it sets a foundation for the first of many items we can do on a bipartisan basis to move this country forward.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the majority leader, for his remarks and indicate that even though this is a Reid-McConnell bill, the true inspirations for this measure being on the Senate floor right now are Senator Alexander from Tennessee and Senator Bingaman from New Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They made an extraordinary contribution in pulling together a disparate group of Senators from different committees to produce an extremely important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The America COMPETES Act is vitally important legislation that this Senate must pass to ensure America retains its competitive edge in the global economy of the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, sponsored by my good friend and counterpart on the other side of the aisle, Senator Reid, also enjoys broad bipartisan support, as I just indicated. Our two parties' cooperation shows how we can and should work together to accomplish important things for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The story of this bill began 2 years ago, when Senators Alexander and Bingaman, from the Energy Committee, with then-Chairman Pete Domenici's blessing, asked the National Academy of Sciences a simple question: What are the top 10 actions that policymakers in Washington could take to keep America in the lead in science and technology for the 21st century?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was the question. The National Academies turned to leaders of business, government, and academia for an answer, including three Nobel prize winners and a university president who is now the Secretary of Defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The respected former CEO of Lockheed Martin, Norm Augustine, headed the panel and produced the report we have all heard so much about, titled "Rising Above the Gathering Storm."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Augustine summed up the problem we face when he wrote in that report:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the five decades since I began working in the aerospace industry, I have never seen American business and academic leaders as concerned about this nation's future prosperity as they are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, his report also specifically recommended to us how we attack this problem, and maintain America's lead in science and innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additional recommendations were made by the Council on Competitiveness and by the President in his American Competitiveness Initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The good news is, boosting the number of rocket scientists--along with mathematicians, engineers, and computer designers--is not rocket science. We currently have the greatest scientific and technological enterprise in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the finest system of colleges and universities anywhere. But in many ways we have become complacent, while other countries are catching up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They see by investing in science and technology and in the education of their citizens, they can attract jobs and create wealth. We must make the same investment in our future if we are to maintain our leadership through this century and beyond in the global marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, <bill type="s" number="761">S. 761</bill>, will help maintain and improve the competitive edge of the United States over the next century by increasing our investment in basic research, strengthening educational opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math at all educational levels, and encouraging young people to pursue careers in those fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From my home State of Kentucky, that means scholarships for future math and science teachers. It means increased research and development at our State universities, which could lead to new discoveries, new high-tech companies, and, of course, new jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This fall, Kentucky will open the Academy of Mathematics and Science in Kentucky at Western Kentucky University, located in Bowling Green. Thanks to the leadership of Dr. Julia Roberts, director of the Center for Gifted Studies at WKU, the academy will bring together talented high-school students from all over the Commonwealth to study advanced math and science year-round--year-round--for college credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will provide Federal support to advanced academies such as the Kentucky Academy throughout the Nation. A good friend of mine at the University of Kentucky, its president, Lee Todd, has also been working for decades to highlight the importance of math, science, and engineering in keeping Kentucky competitive. In a letter he recently sent me, President Todd wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Academies' report "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" has the wrong title. The "storm" is not gathering--it is already here. ..... We are putting our economic future at risk. We must do better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, President Todd knows what he is talking about. Prior to assuming the presidency of one of the State's flagship institutions of higher learning, he was a highly regarded engineer and successful entrepreneur. He has built technology companies that compete in the global economy, and he understands the challenges we face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The America COMPETES Act will make it easier for leaders like him to create more opportunities for technical learning and careers. I want to commend him for all the hard work he has done, and I ask unanimous consent his entire letter be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. President, I especially want to commend, once again, as I did at the outset of my remarks, my good friend from the neighboring State of Tennessee, Senator Alexander, for his extraordinary leadership in building the case for this legislation, helping to craft its various components, and shepherding it through each stage of the process to this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was Senator Alexander who, 2 years ago, along with Senator Bingaman, asked the National Academy of Sciences the question that led to their recommendations, and sparked this entire process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their inquiry led to the release of the Academy's report, which made plain for all that the leadership of the United States in science and technology is eroding, with serious consequences for our workers, our jobs, our economy, and our very way of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Three different committees contributed titles to this bill--the Energy, Commerce and HELP Committees--so I also want to thank those committees' leaders--Senators Inouye and Stevens, Senators Domenici and Bingaman, and Senators Kennedy and Enzi--for their cooperation and hard work on this important bipartisan bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a sign of how cooperative their efforts have been, this bill was actually assembled last year when Republicans held the majority, but it was created in such a bipartisan fashion that we are bringing the very same bill up today under a Democratic majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a credit to the Republican leaders of these three committees, who worked closely with their Democratic counterparts every step of the way to craft this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to recognize the efforts of my friend and predecessor as Republican leader, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee. Senator Frist invested a great deal of time and energy last year to bring these three committees together, and he was the primary sponsor of the bill last year, along with Senator Reid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America has led the world in innovation for over a century. From the light bulb, to the airplane, to the integrated circuit, America has given the world the tools to live happier, easier, and more productive lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the rest of the world is beginning to catch up. Nations such as China and India are seeing the benefits of brainpower and what it can do to remake their economies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The America COMPETES Act is the best way to keep more of the jobs of the 21st century right here in America, and the best way to ensure that our children have the skills to keep America at the forefront of innovation and discovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I thank all of my colleagues for working on this comprehensive, bipartisan solution to reinvigorate scientific exploration and invention at home. This bill is an investment in our children, our schools, and in the future of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a bill this Senate can pass and the President can sign into law. With my colleagues' support, I hope to see exactly that in the very near future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Mexico.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, first I thank Senator Reid and Senator McConnell for their fine statements and their willingness to be the lead in bringing this bill to the floor. It is bipartisan legislation. It is legislation that was developed in the last Congress. We were not able to complete action on it there, so we are trying to do so at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It does represent the work of three committees over the past year. Those are the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and, of course, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. I am fortunate to serve on two of those committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairman and ranking member of each of the three committees are cosponsoring this bill. In fact, we now have 57 Members of the Senate who are cosponsoring this legislation, with Senators Reid and McConnell as the lead sponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill reflects a deep undercurrent of anxiety in this country. It was highlighted recently by the very best-selling book by Tom Friedman called "The World Is Flat." It is also highlighted by the report to which Senator McConnell just referred, the "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" report issued by the National Academies of Science and Engineering. Both of these publications highlight a strengthening, worldwide, of the effort in science and technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although we in the United States are still a world leader in these areas, other nations are clearly catching up. Without effort and intervention now, and attention to this issue now, I fear we may lose our edge in high technology areas that are critical to our future economy. The high technology competition has been an ongoing effort and continues and will continue indefinitely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1980s, during the Cold War, we were about to lose our semiconductor leadership to Japan. Motivated then by national security concerns, the U.S. Government worked with industry to help preserve our domestic chip-making capability. Along with Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and Dr. Bob Noyce, Gordon Moore from Intel, and others, we were able to launch a public-private partnership called Sematech. This partnership developed early phase technologies designed to keep our semiconductor  industry competitive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sematech was a success. It kept our industry competitive through the 1990s and even today. But the issue we are faced with here in 2007 is even more troubling. India and China and other countries from the former Soviet Union now represent nearly 3 billion new capitalists who are coming at us in a competitive way through the Internet where, in one click, anyone in this country can order a product from anywhere in the world and have that delivered to his or her doorstep. Not only can these countries  and entrepreneurs in these countries manufacture at a fraction of the cost that oftentimes is required here in the United States, but in coordination with their Governments they are climbing up the value chain by developing the professional talents in areas such as research and engineering and in telemedicine and in finance--in a whole variety of areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have taken for granted that our Nation would never be displaced in many of these areas. These are areas that represent part of the pillars of our national identity. Many Americans have grown up assuming the United States would always be the leader in high technology, but that is not a foregone conclusion. It is not the simple box fan that is being made in China today that concerns people. It is the sophisticated code from Beijing for enterprise server software or state-of-the-art locomotives  and turbines designed in Bangalore when they used to be designed in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The data paints a disturbing picture about the trends with which we are faced. Right now the United States invests about 2.7 percent of its gross domestic product in research and development. That is not bad. It puts us No. 5 in the world in the percentage of our gross domestic product invested in research and development. Yet we are still behind Korea. We are still behind Japan. Both those countries invest over 3 percent of their gross domestic product in research and development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the issue is not to look at the static snapshot that says today we are fifth in this level of effort, but to look at the change in the rate of commitment over time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me do that with a chart here. I have several charts I want to briefly take people through, to make the case for what we are up against. This is the Emerging Economies Rapidly Increasing Research and Development Investments chart. The top line with the orange dots upon it shows the United States and shows we are investing more than other nations. But the bottom line, which, of course, is rising rapidly, is fast-growing economies. Those economies are specifically China, Ireland, Israel, Singapore,  South Korea, and Taiwan. So clearly we have a circumstance where the rate of change is not favorable to us. In fact, during this same timeframe, China's research and development per GDP grew from .6 percent to 1.4 percent. That is still well behind us, the United States, but it doubled in slightly more than a half dozen years, at a 7-percent annual growth rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The trend line on the chart is self-evident. We need to begin to focus again on this area if we are going to maintain our ability to compete in biotechnology, in semiconductors, in flat panel displays. In some of those areas, particularly flat panel displays, the reality is we no longer compete effectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me move to a second chart. This second chart shows the widening trade deficit in certain advanced technologies, in areas such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and telecommunications. As the sophistication of the imports we bring into this country increases, so will the sophistication of the research and development that is needed to support this type of manufacturing. You can see this orange line here, which represents the trade balance in advanced technology. You can see that up until  somewhere around 2000, or the late 1990s, we had a very positive balance of trade with regard to advanced technology products. Since then, the line has been going down and going down rapidly. This is a concern which all of us should focus on, and this legislation is designed to address this concern head on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third chart shows the average science literacy score of 15-year-old students by country. This is very hard to read. Unfortunately, the lettering is too small. But the main point can be understood. These, of course, are the future scientists and engineers in the world, young people on whom we depend to become future scientists and engineers  and innovators. Obviously, we are concerned that the United States ranks way down here on the chart compared to 15-year-old students in all of these countries above us: Japan, South Korea, Australia, Netherlands, Czech Republic, New Zealand, Canada, Switzerland, France, Belgium, Sweden, Ireland, Hungary--you can follow on down. We come in right behind Iceland. We need to do better. I think  everyone in this country who is concerned about the future of  our economy and the future of our children knows we need to do better by those children and provide a better opportunity for them to compete in this world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me move to the fourth chart. If we look further up the pipeline of future innovators, the news is not that much better. This chart shows the fraction of United States undergraduates who receive science and engineering degrees, so you can see that at least three times more college students graduate with science and engineering degrees in China each year than in the United States. This is not a favorable trend either. Obviously, there are more people in China. But our ability to compete in  the world, to a substantial extent, is going to depend on how many people we can train and equip to compete in this science and competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fifth chart I have here relates to trained scientists and engineers. This shows that China now produces almost as many Ph.D.'s as the United States. Again, the trend is the disturbing part of this chart. It is not that China is producing nearly as many doctoral degrees in the natural sciences and math and engineering as is the United States today. That is a fact but one that does not cause great concern. The concern is that we were dominant in this area and have been for a very long time.  Now that has changed very dramatically. Universities in these other countries are first-class universities and people need to focus on that. Universities such as Tsinghua, in China, are very high quality. If they turn out a Ph.D. in engineering or science or the natural sciences in these schools, those individuals are world-class scientists in their fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a 1995 quote by Alan Greenspan that sums up the importance of investment in research and development and education:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Had the innovations of recent decades, especially in information technologies, not come to fruition, productivity growth would have continued to languish at the rate of the preceding 20 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much of the prosperity we have enjoyed and have come to expect has been the result of the focus we have had on science and engineering in our history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final chart I have here is one from "The Economist." It is based on the 2006 work that was done by three individuals at the Federal Reserve. It deals with this broad category of so-called intangible assets, assets such as research and development, information technology, even finance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Basically what it says is, as a percentage of gross domestic product, there is a very large amount of our gross domestic product that is tied to these so-called intangible assets. They now account for nearly 11 percent of our gross domestic product--that is $3.1 trillion in 2003. In other words, growth that is attributed to such areas is absolutely crucial to our overall economy--again, another reason why we need to be concerned about this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this background, let me briefly talk about what is in the bill before I defer to my colleague here, Senator Alexander. In the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the portion of the bill that was developed out of that committee, we do several things. First, we create a director for math and science education in the Department of Energy whose job it is to coordinate math and science education, departmentwide. The director would report to the Under Secretary for Science in the  Department of Energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next, we would significantly increase funding for the Department of Energy's Office of Science to match the multiyear funding profile of the President's advanced competitiveness initiative which he presented to us here this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, the bill proposes to create an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy, to translate basic research that is carried out in the Office of Science into solutions for critical problems facing the applied energy programs in the Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Examples of such problems would include hydrogen fuel storage using new materials or applying nanoscience to a new generation of solid-state lights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill will also address broader themes related to math and science education. According to the National Academy of Sciences, the technical building blocks of our Nation's economic strength have been eroding for a time. We need to produce students who are prepared to meet the challenges of the 21st century. That means more attention to math and science education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America COMPETES contains a number of important provisions to improve K-12 math and science education, strengthen science and math skills of our teaching workforce. I know Senator Reid talked eloquently about that need and, of course, the commitment our former colleague, Paul Simon, had to progress in that area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it provides incentives for universities to systematically change the way they prepare teachers to teach math and science. The legislation provides grants to universities to integrate the teacher preparation programs with rich content subject matter in math and science, develop bachelor's degree programs in math and science with concurrent teacher certification, as well as master's degree programs in math and science for people who are currently teaching in our schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, to make these programs attractive to students who are inclined to study these subjects--math, science, and engineering--the legislation significantly expands the National Science Foundation scholarships for students to become math and science teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation significantly expands opportunities for teachers to strengthen their math and science skills. The bill increases training for teachers to become qualified to teach advanced placement courses and international baccalaureate courses in math and science. The bill provides significant training opportunities for teachers at both the National Science Foundation, as well as our National Laboratories, and there I think some of the summer programs Senator Reid was talking about  are intended to take place at our universities, at our laboratories. Clearly, he is right in saying we need to provide the financial wherewithal so that teachers can take advantage of these programs and can upgrade their knowledge and then give that knowledge to their students the next school year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, the legislation provides grants to States to promote better alignment of elementary and secondary education with the knowledge and skills needed for success in postsecondary education and in the 21st century workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill significantly increases funding for the National Science Foundation, essentially doubling that budget in 5 years, while ensuring that the math and science education programs that are in the National Science Foundation increase at the same rate as the overall budget increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill helps manufacturers by increasing funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, by 33 percent over 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have said many times, this America COMPETES bill is only an authorization bill. The hard part, obviously, is going to be providing the funds to carry out the programs in this bill to meet these authorization targets we have set.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this regard, we were successful just a month or so ago, with Senator Alexander's good help, in adopting an amendment in the Senate which was an amendment to the budget resolution. It was adopted 71 to 1 to provide $1 billion in additional leeway or additional opportunity to meet the President's request in the areas of funding for the Department of Energy's Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and NIST. Because of that amendment to the budget resolution, virtually all  of the authorization we are calling for in this legislation will be permitted to be appropriated this year, and that is very good news.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is a good bill. It is bipartisan. Like most bipartisan bills, it is the product of much negotiation. Many competing views, many competing interests have had a chance to be heard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of the way this bill has come together. Our staffs deserve great credit for the hard work they have put into this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I particularly commend Senator Alexander. He is the person who got this initiative started and came to me initially and said: Let's do this letter to the National Academies and see if they will do a study and tell us what are the most important things we can do in this country to keep this country competitive in world markets. That is what  then led to the Augustine Commission report and, of course, that combined with the other reports that came  forward--and there were several other very useful reports--that have gotten us to this point. Senator Alexander deserves particular credit for the success we have had so far.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope all colleagues will look seriously at this legislation and will support the effort to move ahead with it. This is authorizing legislation. In doing the appropriations bills that will come to the floor later this year, we still will have an opportunity to debate the specific funding levels for some of these programs. This sets out a framework for progress which can be very beneficial to this country and a framework which is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor. I know my colleague from Tennessee wishes to speak at this time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Tennessee.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. No one in the Senate on either side of the aisle has been more consistent or more effective in advancing our Nation's position in science and technology. He is also a delight to work with. It is rare to have a chance to work across the aisle in the way we have the last couple of years, not only on this legislation, but Senator Bingaman, for example, noticed that we were losing our edge in world-class computing. He saw  that because of a visit to Japan. He came to me, and we worked together to try to restore that edge. He constantly is doing that in a quiet and effective way. It is a pleasure to work with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank the majority leader, Senator Reid, and the Republican leader, Senator McConnell. Senator Bingaman and I went to see the majority leader 2 years ago when he was the minority leader. We asked him to do exactly what he has done. He and Senator Frist did. They created an environment in which this bill had a chance to succeed. Then Senator McConnell stepped right up, following Senator Frist's tremendous help and leadership in this effort, and it is  fairly remarkable that we worked so evenly together in the last Republican Senate on this bill that the legislation was introduced in the Democratic Senate in the same way because we worked together on it and, hopefully, that has produced a better result.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I begin my remarks with a story. Last August, a group of Senators went to China. We were led by two of our most distinguished Members, Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, the two leaders of the Commerce Committee and two of the major contributors to this legislation. Those two Senators were very well received in China. Senator Inouye, of course, is a Congressional Medal of Honor winner from World War II, and Senator Stevens was a Flying Tiger. He flew the first  cargo plane into Beijing toward the end of World War II. So he was very well received in China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, we had a chance to meet with the senior leaders of China in a way most Americans had not to that time. We spent an hour with President Hu. We spent another hour with the No. 2 leader in China, Mr. Wu, who is chairman of the National People's Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We talked about the issues one would expect an American delegation of a dozen Senators would talk about with the leaders of China. We talked about their military posture. We talked about North Korea. We talked about Iraq. We talked about Iran. But, Mr. President--I can still see this--in both of the meetings we had, one with Mr. Hu, the second with Mr. Wu, there was one subject about which those two leaders of China were most animated, and that was the subject we are discussing today:  how to develop China's brain power advantage so they can create more good, new jobs in China. That was the subject they really wanted to talk about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Hu had gone to the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering just a month earlier in July. He assembled them in the Great Hall of the people. He outlined a new 15-year plan to make China a technology leader in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his speech, President Hu said China must "promote a huge leap forward in science and technology. We shall put strengthening independent innovation capability at the core of economic structure adjustment."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Anyone who follows China knows that when their leaders talk about leaps forward, it is a pretty big deal. President Hu's new plan appears more likely to succeed and includes reforming China's universities and massively investing in new research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We regularly see stories of how Chinese-born academicians, some of our most distinguished faculty members at our major universities, are now accepting invitations to go back to China, their homeland, and create great universities there. There are a lot of people here--one-half of the Nobel Prize winners in physics who are American are immigrants or the sons and daughters of immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So China is serious about this plan. Mr. Hu said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all bear the time-honored mission to provide strong scientific support for the construction of a well-off society by improving our independent innovation capability and building an innovative country. I hope that our scientists and technicians will strive hard to make our brilliant achievements and constantly contribute to our country and our people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those are the leaders of China. They know what to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States has a remarkable position. As Senator Bingaman said, Senator Reid said, and Senator McConnell said, we don't want to take it for granted because we can't. But let's stop and think about where we are. This huge brain power advantage we have in the United States of America has given us a situation in which we produce about 30 percent of the gross national product in the world in for about 5 percent of the people. About 30 percent of all the dollars,  volume in the world this year is being produced in this country, a country that only includes 5 percent of the people. How does that happen? The United States has a number of advantages: its location, its resources, the great diversity we have here, the fact we have turned all that diversity into one country. But when we look at all of our</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No other country has had the broad system of education we have had. No other country has the large number of great research universities the United States of America has. No other country has the great National Laboratories we have. As a result, over the last century, especially since World War II, no other country has come close to turning its brainpower advantage into jobs, into dollars, into a high standard of living for a large number of people, and the rest of the world sees that. They see  it on television. They see it on the Internet. They see it because more than half a million students from around the world, many of the brightest men and women in the world, come here to our universities, and they see what we have been able to do, and they say: Why can't we do this at home in China?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also spreads our democracy, our ideals. We go to Thailand or some other country, and we find the Minister of Agriculture is a graduate of the University of Tennessee. He has learned here. He goes there and teaches about agriculture, and he promotes our ideas. Our higher education system has probably been the most effective foreign aid we have ever invested in, just those half million students who go there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, we are at risk of losing our brainpower advantage. If we lose our brainpower advantage, we lose our advantage and our standard of living. In other words, in plain English, we don't have as much money in our pockets, we don't have as many good jobs, and our families don't have the kind of prosperity many have come to take for granted. That is what this piece of legislation is about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We talk a lot about outsourcing jobs, about growing new jobs. Well, this is the way to keep good new jobs in the United States and to grow them. When a graduate of a university, such as the student at the University of Maryland--I think he dropped out, actually--a foreign student--creates Google, that creates thousands and thousands of new jobs in the United States, as Thomas Edison did years ago, as Bill Gates did more recently, and as thousands of entrepreneurs do every day. It takes the brainpower  advantage to create the job and it takes the brainpower advantage to work at the facility or the plant that has the jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why, toward the end of a long Budget Committee hearing 2 years ago, I was getting a little depressed listening to what I heard about the numbers. According to the budget 2 years ago, and the budget last year, and the budget this year, we are on an unsustainable course in terms of being able to pay for Medicare and Medicaid. So the question came to me: Well, if we are going to squeeze out everything else in order to pay for Medicare and Medicaid and other programs, the war in Iraq, then  how are we going to invest in this great engine of brainpower that creates the money that pays all the bills? I struggled with this as the Governor of Tennessee. I was trying to raise our standard of living in Tennessee. We were the third poorest State 25 years ago when I became Governor, based on family incomes. We already had</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of better schools, better colleges, and better universities, combined with our other advantages, we moved ahead in our State. Better schools meant better jobs. Better colleges and universities mean better jobs. More research means better jobs. So we are talking today about better jobs--progrowth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We better realize as well that we have some pretty big bills to pay. Last year, we spent $237 billion on debt, $378 billion on Medicare, $545 billion on Social Security, $70 billion or more on hurricanes, and we are spending about $4 billion a week on Iraq. What this legislation does is authorizes $4 billion a year over the next 4 years. As Senator Bingaman said, we made room for it in the budget this year to create and encourage and continue to push ahead this brainpower engine that  creates the money to pay for all these necessary and urgent needs we have, these priorities we have. This is a progrowth piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say this may be the most important piece of legislation the Congress considers in this 2-year session. If it is not the most important piece of legislation, there is certainly no more important subject to most American families than: How do I keep money in my pocket to pay my bills? How do we keep our jobs from going to India and China? How do we keep our economic advantage? How do we come close to continuing to be the country that produces 30 percent of all the money in the world for  only 5 percent of the people? That is why, at the end of that Budget Committee hearing I mentioned a little earlier, I literally walked down the street to the National Academy of Sciences and asked them, on behalf of Senator Bingaman and myself, with the approval of Senator Domenici, the chairman of our committee, and with the endorsement of Representatives Boehlert and Gordon in the House of Representatives--I</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Academy of Sciences and of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine formed an immediate group. They asked Norm Augustine, the former chief executive officer of Lockheed Martin and a member of the National Academy of Engineering, to chair the group. He turned to 21 distinguished Americans who know a lot about the world and our country, Craig Barrett, chairman of the board of Intel; Steven Chu, cowinner of the Nobel prize in physics and Director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory;  Robert Gates, who was then head of Texas A&amp;M and now is the Secretary of Defense, and a number of others; the former head of MIT, Peter O'Donnell, a Texas businessman who has worked on AP courses, and they did this report: "Rising Above The Gathering Storm."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At that point, we formed a bipartisan group of Senators and began to have what we called "homework sessions" with the various agencies of the Federal Government that had jurisdiction over these programs and the areas where the programs would fit. We also recognized that Senator Lieberman, Senator Ensign, and others had been working hard with the Council on Competitiveness, and they had similar recommendations. We also acknowledged that Senators Hutchison, Bond,  and Mikulski had for many years been advocating various aspects of these programs, so we tried to integrate all of this into a whole. That produced a long piece of legislation that had to make its way through five different committees, but it attracted 70 sponsors last year--35 Democrats, 35 Republicans. The Republican leader, Senator Frist, and the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, were the principal sponsors of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Bingaman has done a good job of outlining most of the provisions of the bill, so I will, in a few minutes, put those into the record, but there is no other piece of legislation during the past 2 years that was so broadly recommended by disinterested groups outside of the Senate and the House, that has been worked on by so many Senators here, and that has moved forward in the way this has. Making this even more remarkable is not only was it introduced by the Democratic and Republican  leaders, it has been brought directly to the floor for debate. So what we hope is our colleagues will carefully read the bill, bring their amendments to the floor, and maybe we can operate in an old-fashioned way here. Maybe we can consider the amendments, or the improvements, debate them, vote on them, go to the next amendment, and then after we have finished with that, have a vote on whether to pass the bill, which I believe we will. I think we have a good chance of doing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to now insert into the Record a few items that are important for our colleagues and those who are following this debate, so I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks a "Dear Colleague" letter of April 10, written by Senator Reid and Senator McConnell to all of our colleagues, signed by the chairmen and Democratic and Republican leaders of the three major committees which contributed to this, and which produced 50 cosponsors--we hope there  will be more by next week--be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we will have plenty of time to debate this next week, so I will reserve most of my comments until then, but let me reiterate some of the major provisions that are here. As Senator Bingaman said, this is only an authorization bill. It is permission to establish programs, but it is backed up by an amendment to the Budget Act which creates room in the appropriations bill to pay for these programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what we intend to do: Double funding for the National Science Foundation; set the Department of Energy's Office of Science on track to double its funding; strengthen the skills of thousands of math and science teachers by establishing training and education programs at summer institutes hosted by the national laboratories; and by increasing support for teacher institutes for programs at the National Science Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the kinds of programs that Senator Reid, the majority leader, was talking about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Expand the teacher scholarship programs at NSF; help establish academies for math and science in the various States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>North Carolina has had one for a long time, and 20 years ago, when I was Governor, I went to see if Tennessee could create one. We decided we didn't have the money to do it, so we created a summer Governor's school, which turned out to be a good idea, where outstanding students from math and science could go to the University of Tennessee for 4 weeks in the summer. The faculty loves it, the students love it, and they participate in the Oak Ridge Laboratory. They go back fired up into their classrooms,  and the teachers are fired up as well. Our Governor Bredesen wants to create a summer school for math and science, and he has started on a modest basis, but this will help him expand that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will expand advanced placement in international baccalaureate programs by increasing the number of teachers who are trained to teach math, science, and foreign languages. This would allow thousands of new students to take these courses. The AP courses, as we call them, are a good track to college, and college is a good track to success. Those students are the ones who will help create the jobs to keep our high standard of living. But we have a lot of students, many of them lower income, who  don't take these courses and who easily could. So we will help pay for their tests, and we will train more teachers so they can be taught, and we will see that three or four times more students will be able to do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These programs weren't picked out of thin air. This group of distinguished Nobel laureates, university presidents, and business leaders spent their summer 2 years ago reviewing many programs. For example, the AP program comes from a Texas program which has been successful for 10 years. They picked the 20 best ideas in priority order from among hundreds of ideas. This is not merely a group of Senators and Congressmen picking our best friend's favorite program. We all have one of those. This is  the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering and the Institute of Medicine reviewing hundreds of programs with a distinguished panel in answering our question exactly what do we need to do to keep our brainpower advantage, and they say here are the first 20 things you ought to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not in this legislation are other provisions that were part of this report and that were acted on in the last Congress. One was the temporary extension of the research and development tax credit. It should be made permanent. Another are several provisions for attracting and keeping in this country talented professionals from overseas. These 500,000 foreign students who are here include some of the brightest students from China, some of the brightest students from India, some of the brightest  from around the world. They are going to create jobs somewhere. We would like for them to stay and create jobs here, yet our archaic immigration laws prevent that. They require these students to swear they are going home before they come. They make it hard for them to stay once they get here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the Senate, last year, in debating the immigration bill, adopted three of the provisions from this report. One, for example, pins a green card on any foreign student who gets a graduate degree in math, science, engineering and technology so that person can stay here and create jobs for us here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am hopeful when we get to the immigration legislation within a few weeks that we will do at least that much to change our archaic immigration laws and allow those students to stay here and create jobs for us. We talk a lot about outsourcing jobs. This would be insourcing brain power, and we would be smart to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I particularly thank our staffs, and we will do this specifically by name next week. This is a complex bill with many different parts, as the section-by-section analysis shows. They have worked evenly to try to make this a well-crafted bill. We have more work to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I conclude by again thanking the Democratic and Republican leaders, Senator Bingaman, Senator Domenici, especially, who was chairman of our committee last year, Stevens and Inouye, Enzi and Kennedy, Ensign and Lieberman, Bond, Hutchison, Chambliss, Murkowski, and Mikulski--all of these Senators made major contributions. I am sure they will be on the Senate floor next week to address this legislation and to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are talking about keeping our brain power advantage so we keep our jobs. We are talking about a country that has grown accustomed to 30 percent of all of the money in the world being produced each year with just 5 percent of the people, and we are saying, unless we take at least these steps, that won't continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Exhibit 1</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. SENATE,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, April 10, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR COLLEAGUE: We are writing to invite you to cosponsor the America COMPETES Act; a bipartisan bill to help America maintain its edge in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in an increasingly competitive global economy. An earlier version of this bill was introduced in the final days of the 109th Congress as <bill type="s" number="3936">S. 3936</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The America COMPETES Act is based upon recommendations from both the national Academies' "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" report and the Council on Competitiveness' "Innovate America" report. It contains revised versions of the legislation approved by both the Senate Energy and Commerce Committees [from the 109th Congress] in response to those recommendations: <bill type="s" number="2197">S. 2197</bill>, the PACE-Energy bill, and <bill type="s" number="2802">S. 2802</bill> the American Innovation and Competitiveness bill, which were reported without opposition  to the Senate floor. The bill also includes provisions developed by the bipartisan leadership of the HELP Committee to improve science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and critical foreign language skills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The competitiveness package would significantly increase the federal investment in basic research, foster and innovative infrastructure, improve the teaching of math, science, engineering and technology to our children, and encourage the brightest minds to pursue careers in these fields. Among other provisions, the bill would: Double the investment in basic research at the national Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Department of Energy's  Office of Science (DOE-SC) over five to ten years; Improve teacher training in math and science, through summer institutes hosted by the NSF and the DOE-SC and grants to increase university degree programs that combine math and science study with concurrent teacher certification; and Increase support for Advanced Placement programs to expand access for low income students to take and succeed in college preparatory courses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill alone will not secure American leadership in the decades to come. But it is a critical first step toward protecting our competitive position in the world. We hope you will join us in this effort and cosponsor this bipartisan legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Exhibit 2</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Summary of the "America Competes Act"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The "America COMPETES Act" is a bipartisan legislative response to recommendations contained in the National Academies' "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" report and the Council on Competitiveness' "Innovate America" report. The bill is similar to the "National Competitiveness Investment Act" that Senators Frist, Reid, Stevens, Inouye, Domenici, Bingaman, Enzi, Kennedy, Ensign, Lieberman, Alexander, Mikulski, Hutchison, and others introduced in September 2006. Several sections of the  bill are derived from proposals contained in the "American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2006" (<bill type="s" number="2802">S. 2802</bill>), approved without opposition by the Senate Commerce Committee, and the "Protecting America's Competitive Edge Through Energy Act of 2006" (<bill type="s" number="2197">S. 2197</bill>) approved without opposition by the Senate Energy Committee last year. Accordingly, the America COMPETES Act focuses on</paragraph>
    <paragraph>INCREASE RESEARCH INVESTMENT BY:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Doubling funding for the National Science Foundation (NSF) from approximately $5.6 billion in Fiscal Year 2006 to $11.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Setting the Department of Energy's Office of Science on track to double in funding over 10 years, increasing from $3.6 billion in Fiscal Year 2006 to over $5.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Establishing the Innovation Acceleration Research Program to direct federal agencies funding research in science and technology to set as a goal dedicating approximately 8 percent of their Research and Development (R&amp;D) budgets toward high-risk frontier research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Authorizing the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) from approximately $703 million in Fiscal Year 2008 to approximately $937 million in Fiscal Year 2011 and requiring NIST to set aside no less than 8 percent of its annual funding for high-risk, high-reward innovation acceleration research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Directing NASA to increase funding for basic research and fully participate in interagency activities to foster competitiveness and innovation, using the full extent of existing budget authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coordinating ocean and atmospheric research and education at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other agencies to promote U.S. leadership in these important fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>STRENGTHEN EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS, AND CRITICAL FOREIGN LANGUAGES BY:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Authorizing competitive grants to States to promote better alignment of elementary and secondary education with the knowledge and skills needed for success in postsecondary education, the 21st century workforce, and the Armed Forces, and grants to support the establishment or improvement of statewide P-16 education longitudinal data systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Strengthening the skills of thousands of math and science teachers by establishing training and education programs at summer institutes hosted at the National Laboratories and by increasing support for the Teacher Institutes for the 21st Century program at NSF.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Expanding the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program at NSF to recruit and train individuals to become math and science teachers in high-need local educational agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Assisting States in establishing or expanding statewide specialty schools in math and science that students from across the state would be eligible to attend and providing expert assistance in teaching from National Laboratories' staff at those schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Facilitating the expansion of Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) programs by increasing the number of teachers prepared to teach AP/IB and pre-AP/IB math, science, and foreign language courses in high need schools, thereby increasing the number of courses available and students who take and pass AP and IB exams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Developing and implementing programs for bachelor's degrees in math, science, engineering, and critical foreign languages with concurrent teaching credentials and part-time master's in education programs for math, science, and critical foreign language teachers to enhance both content knowledge and teaching skills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Creating partnerships between National Laboratories and local high-need high schools to establish centers of excellence in math and science education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Expanding existing NSF graduate research fellowship and traineeship programs, requiring NSF to work with institutions of higher education to facilitate the development of professional science master's degree programs, and expanding NSF's science, mathematics, engineering and technology talent program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Providing Math Now grants to improve math instruction in the elementary and middle grades and provide targeted help to struggling students so that all students can master grade-level mathematics standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Expanding programs to increase the number of students from elementary school through postsecondary education who study critical foreign languages and become proficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEVELOP AN INNOVATION INFRASTRUCTURE BY:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Establishing a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness to develop a comprehensive agenda to promote innovation and competitiveness in the public and private sectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Requiring the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study to identify forms of risk that create barriers to innovation.</paragraph>
