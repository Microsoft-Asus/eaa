    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I ask my colleagues to join me today in honoring the memory of an extraordinary Californian, Elizabeth Terwilliger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the Marin County community, Elizabeth Terwilliger was a renowned naturalist and educator, beloved by schoolchildren and adults, who leaves an amazing environmental legacy. She died on November 27, 2006 at the age of 97. She is survived by her daughter Lynn, her son John, and several grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Elizabeth Cooper was born in Hawaii in 1909. She moved to the mainland to pursue a master's degree in nutrition from Columbia University in New York and then attended Stanford nursing school. While at Stanford, she met her husband, Dr. Calvin Terwilliger. After World War II, the couple settled in Mill Valley, California where they raised two children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Elizabeth took her children on nature walks throughout Marin County. Soon, she was leading nature walks for local Girl Scout and Boy Scout troops. Her unique hands-on style and storytelling ability became known throughout the community and soon she began leading field trips for area schools and environmental organizations. Leading such trips 5 days a week became her life's work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the 50 years that followed, every child growing up in Marin County knew Mrs. Terwilliger. She was a famous and beloved educator who traveled across the county in her familiar van filled with life-like animal models to teach school children about nature. Upon sight of her characteristic floppy straw hat, children would come running and follow her through the woods with excitement and adoration. They would soak up her stories and bring them home to teach their parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who knew Mrs. Terwilliger well recount her mesmerizing personality, her passion for nature and wildlife, and her openhearted way with children and adults alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1984, President Ronald Reagan honored Mrs. Terwilliger as an outstanding volunteer. While accepting the award at the White House, she shared one of her famous stories about "Mr. Vulture," and had President Reagan holding his arms over his head in the "V" position, representing a vulture in flight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to leading nature education programs, Mrs. Terwilliger was an advocate for environmental conservation and open space. She campaigned for a monarch butterfly preserve, bicycle paths, wetlands and open space preservation. She received numerous awards and has two preserves named after her: Terwilliger Marsh in Mill Valley and Terwilliger Butterfly Grove at Muir Beach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She inspired Joan Linn Bekins to create the Elizabeth Terwilliger Nature Education Foundation, which later became known as WildCare. Using educational programs developed by Mrs. Terwilliger, the center provides nature programs for over 40,000 Bay Area schoolchildren each year. The center also treats thousands of wildlife each year, rehabilitating them and returning them to their natural environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Terwilliger often said, "while you're learning, you're living." Her life's passion was to teach people how to embrace and love nature. She was a local treasure and a wonderful, inspiring woman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I knew Mrs. Terwilliger and respected and admired her greatly. She will be deeply missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those of us who were fortunate to know her, we take comfort in knowing that schoolchildren will continue to learn from Mrs. Terwilliger's unique  educational style at WildCare. Her vision, her passion and her spirit will remain in the countless lives she touched.</paragraph>
