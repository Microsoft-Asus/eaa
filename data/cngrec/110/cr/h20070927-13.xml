  <narrative>FREEDOM OF SPEECH -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10942]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Ms. SHEA-PORTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yesterday, there was a resolution before the House which I voted for, and the reason I voted for it was because it stated it expresses our appreciation, talking about General Petraeus, for his personal sacrifices and those of his family, as well as the sacrifices of those who served in the Armed Forces and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I too had a husband who served in the Armed Forces, and I was a family member, and so I supported that. But here is where I have trouble. It went on to attack MoveOn.org, saying such unwarranted attacks should be strongly condemned by Republicans and Democrats alike in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, too, would like to improve the tone here in this House. I would like to see civility. But they forgot to mention something in that resolution. They forgot to condemn the Swift Boating; they forgot to condemn the comments against Senator Max Cleland and other veterans who served this country honorably as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wait for a new resolution that condemns behavior on both sides of the aisle attacking all veterans from all political persuasions. Until then, I support free speech.</paragraph>
