  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, following leader time, the Senate will proceed to a period of morning business, with the time until 5:30 this evening equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees. As has been previously announced, there will be no rollcall votes today. There will be votes, though, tomorrow, as early as 11 a.m.--probably about 11:10 a.m.--and we will begin voting in relation to the following items: McConnell amendment on energy, with a 60-vote threshold; the  Reid amendment on energy, with a 60-vote threshold--of course, my name is on the amendment because I offered it as part of my leadership responsibilities, but that is an amendment that has been worked on very hard by Senator Dorgan of North Dakota--and passage of the flood insurance legislation. I say, Mr. President, it will be a good day for America when we pass that. That will affect millions of Americans. The Banking Committee did an outstanding job</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So between now and the Memorial Day recess, we have a tremendous amount of work to do. There is so much unfinished business. But let me mention a few of the things we are going to complete or give it our very best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first responders collective bargaining bill: We will be on that tomorrow. The farm bill conference report: We expect the House to consider the conference report as early as Wednesday. We need to complete it before we leave this week, which brings me to the point: We are going to do everything we can to see that we can complete our business by noon on Friday. But that is no guarantee. There will have to be some cooperation among Senators; otherwise, we are going to have to work--I know this  is difficult because people have responsibilities other places outside Washington, but we very likely could have some work Friday afternoon, hopefully not very late in the day. But I do not know. Everyone should be prepared and arrange their schedules accordingly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have this week and next week. One of the things we need to do is appoint conferees to the budget resolution. The House is expected to appoint conferees this week. There is a statutory 10-hour limitation on debate to go to conference. As Senators know, motions to instruct are in order. I will work with the Republican leader on an agreement to move the process forward in an orderly fashion; otherwise, we will do it in a disorderly fashion, and we will have only 10 hours to be disorderly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also have a statutory direction to complete a resolution of disapproval, either yes or no, regarding FCC media ownership rulemaking. The reason we are able to do this, Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma and I worked in the early 1990s to pass--and we did--a piece  of legislation that says if the administration or an agency promulgates a regulation, and we do not like it, we can overturn it. We have done that in the past, and that is what this is all about.  It is a nondebatable motion to proceed to the resolution, and there are 10 hours of debate with no amendments in order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also have--even though we can say it quickly, it is going to take some time--the emergency supplemental, which will be on the floor next Wednesday. We need to complete this before the recess. We are not going to be panicked into completing this. We know there is enough money to fund the troops for a considerable period after the Memorial Day recess. We want to get it done, and we will do our best to get that done, but we are not going to be pushed into doing something we do not think is appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On judges, I committed to Senator McConnell that I would use my best efforts to have the Senate consider three court of appeals nominees before the Memorial Day recess. I have been working with Senator Leahy to meet that pledge. The nomination of Steven Agee to be a Fourth Circuit judge should be available for debate late this week or early next week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are also trying to move forward on two court of appeals nominees from Michigan. The problem we have had with that is Republicans on the Judiciary Committee complained that Chairman Leahy is moving these too quickly. So, Mr. President, they cannot have it both ways. If I am going to do what I said I would do, we need some cooperation from the Republicans. I cannot push the committee to take up nominees they do not want. It is my understanding these two appeals court nominees from Michigan  have been worked out over a period of 6 years. It has taken a long time to get to where we are now. So I would hope the Republicans would back off their slow-walking this. Otherwise, we are not going to be able to complete these nominations before the Memorial Day recess.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, we are going to do our utmost to get a vote on an energy package before we leave for the Memorial Day recess. I repeat, we will likely have to have votes on this Friday. We will do them as quickly as we can. There will be no votes on Monday. We have had a number of requests over many months for people who have things to do in their home States on that day. There will be no votes on Monday. So that is going to make everything very difficult next week because I have outlined the many different  things we have to do.</paragraph>
