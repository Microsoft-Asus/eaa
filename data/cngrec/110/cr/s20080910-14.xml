  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, yesterday the CBO gave us their estimates of what the deficit is going to be and what the deficit for next year will be, and it is not good news. The deficit has more than doubled. It is projected now to be $407 billion. That is up from about $160 billion. That has all occurred under the leadership of this Democratic Congress. Obviously, the administration takes significant responsibility, but the Congress, under the law, under the Constitution, controls the purse strings,  and the Congress has the control over the check writing of the Government. As a result, the first responsibility for fiscal restraint and fiscal discipline is with the Congress, and it has failed that test.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is hard to imagine how the deficit could jump this much in this short period of time. Most people will say it is the result of the war--or people on the other side will say that. It is not. This jump in the deficit, to the extent it was controllable from the Federal Government's standpoint--in other words, it wasn't caused by the slowdown in the economy--was purely a function of increased spending on nondefense--not purely but was significantly increased by spending on nondefense activities  and a dramatic increase in spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is that not only is this deficit now at $400 billion and going up  under this Congress, but the outyears are even more severe that the risk for us as a nation is even more dramatic from the standpoint of fiscal policy because looming over the horizon is the problem with entitlement spending which will expand dramatically as the baby boom generation retires and where we already know there is more than $60 trillion of unfunded liability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What has this Congress's response been to this situation? It is the worst record in the last 20 years. One appropriations bill--one appropriations bill--freestanding, has been passed in the last 2 years, the Defense appropriations bill last year. There have been Omnibus appropriations bills passed. Then this year, we are going to pass, it looks like, not an Omnibus appropriations bill but simply a continuing resolution; a complete abdication, a complete abandonment of the budget process, of the  responsibility--the first responsibility of the Congress, other than defending the country--of setting up a fiscal process for managing the taxpayers' dollars has occurred under the leadership of this Democratic Congress. It is truly the worst record in the last 20 years. Nothing like</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The debt has gone up over $1 trillion, $1 trillion added to the debt in the last 2 years. The deficit has doubled, and yet there has been no effort at all not only to do the day-to-day responsibility of managing the Government, which, after all, is the responsibility of the Congress, by passing appropriations bills, but to address the issue of the looming crisis in our entitlement accounts--no effort to address entitlement reform or even at the margin to try to control the rate of growth of entitlement  programs. Even the most simple ideas which are reasonable and could have been accomplished have not been pursued, ideas such as making wealthy people pay for some portion of their Part D premium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Warren Buffett, who qualifies for a drug benefit under Medicare, does not have to pay for any of that or pays only a marginal amount of that cost compared to what he should be paying as a high-income individual. That adjustment has been ignored. Ideas such as that which make sense that would at least save us some money have not even been brought forward; zero effort in the area of Medicare reform, in the area of Medicaid reform, and in the area of entitlement reform by this Congress, zero  effort in the area of controlling spending. Not one program has been reduced, not one program has been eliminated, not one program has been adjusted downward. Everything has gone up and up and up. Thousands of earmarks have been proposed, thousands--7,000 or 11,000, I have forgotten the number. Senator Coburn knows it off the top of his head. But it is so many you can't even keep track of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a true dereliction of duty by this Democratic Congress the way the fiscal house of this country has been managed. They do debt, they do deficits, and they do nothing, and they deserve a D minus when it comes to managing our fiscal house.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unfortunate because all these costs which we are running up represent radical increases in borrowing which means dramatic burdens for our children and our grandchildren as they have to pay these bills when they come due in the outyears instead of paying as we go, which is the appropriate way to proceed with spending. We are simply  borrowing from our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, the pay-go rules, which were supposed to discipline spending, have been waived, adjusted, and gamed time after time to the point where over $399 billion under this Congress has been spent or put on the books as an obligation which should have all been subject to a pay-go point of order. But those pay-go points of order have been adjusted, waived, or gamed so they did not even get raised or, if they did get raised, they got run over by the majority in this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the rules which this Congress put in place to try to discipline spending and which we so often hear chest beating about from the other side of the aisle--I am for pay-go--have been eviscerated. I call it "Swiss-cheese go." It has no relevance at all any longer because the spending around here occurs in a manner which is profligate and there is no attempt to adjust spending to reflect revenues, to attempt to bring down the deficit. In fact, the deficit is now double.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not good news for the American taxpayer. Here we are in a situation where we are facing some very serious fiscal times, and we ought to at least be able to discipline our budgets in a more effective way. We ought to at least do the business of the Congress, which is to pass appropriations bills which are within the budget rather than pass supplemental emergencies which are outside the budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a problem, and it is a significant problem. It is brought about in large part because this Congress has failed to do its job of managing the fiscal house or even taking up the bills which are supposed to manage the fiscal house.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is another subject I want to touch base on--I see the majority leader is here and as a courtesy, I will proceed to those comments so I don't take up too much of his time--and that is the issue of the highway trust fund needing to be replenished to meet obligations which it has incurred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A little bit of history is important, if the majority leader will allow me to proceed briefly to outline the history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We passed something called SAFETEA back in 1995. That bill set out highway spending which was supposed to be paid for from the highway fund, which the highway fund is paid for by gas taxes. But that bill was intentionally structured--intentionally structured--so that the spending would exceed the income. We knew one day during the term of that bill--people thought it would be later in the process--the highway trust fund would be spent out and there would be a problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why do we know that? Because that bill included 6,000 earmarks totaling $24 billion which we knew were not going to be able to be totally paid for by gas tax revenues even if the gas tax revenues had maintained themselves.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator has used 10 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What happened was that the gas tax revenues have fallen because of the increase in gas prices and the American people's appropriate effort to try to conserve their use of gasoline. So the day of reckoning has come earlier, much earlier, than expected, but we knew there was going to be a day of reckoning because the bill was structured to fail. All these 6,000 projects that were put in there, $24 billion of spending we knew was not going to work or be paid for under the present bill. So now the  suggestion is that rather than pay for them in a responsible way, we should raid the general fund, take that money and use it in the highway trust fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The highway trust fund has always been a separate entity. The whole purpose of the highway trust fund was to fund highways and have them have their own stream of revenues to fund them and to not commingle those funds with the general fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The argument has been made--and it is a straw dog argument of the most extraordinary level--that back in 1998, the highway trust fund lent $8 billion to the general fund, and they are just trying to recover that now as an accounting event. That puts a whole new spin on the concept of accounting. Even the people who did Enron's internal accounting would have found that one a hard sell. That was a movement in 1998 of nothing more than paper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This event is a real addition to the Federal debt of $8 billion. This is real money; that had no real money involved. This has a real effect; that had no real effect involved. So that argument is truly a straw dog argument put out there to try to legitimize a raid on the general fund in order to settle up the highway fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I know I am going to lose this fight, and I am not trying to stop the fight. I am not trying to stop the event. I haven't suggested we need 60 votes to go through this. What I have suggested--and I will ask unanimous consent to accomplish this--is that we simply have two amendments: One--mine--would put back in place pay-go rules and the Byrd rule prospectively--so it doesn't even affect this event--so  this doesn't happen again. Both of those should  be disciplining events on how we fund roads, and it is the right procedure. It is not an outrageous request to proceed that way. The other is the Coburn-DeMint amendment, which says that any money that is taken out of the highway fund will be used for building roads or bridges, as I understand it, and not be used for things such as bike paths and basketball arenas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So those are the two amendments; that those amendments be brought up, debated, and voted on in a very short and very constricted timeframe and then we have a final passage vote. The majority leader has asked for an amendment to his proposal, so if either one of these proposals were to pass, it is going to go back to the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The argument that this is going to slow the process doesn't really have legs because, first off, we may lose both our amendments, but even if we don't lose them, the majority leader has proposed a unanimous-consent request which has an amendment in it, and that amendment will pass because, in effect, it is an effective date amendment. But that will send it back to the House and it will have to be done again, anyway. So as a practical matter, these proposals aren't going to slow the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It does seem to me it is reasonable to have two amendments and then final passage or three amendments and then final passage rather than just one amendment and have final passage, and do it all within a framework that has a reasonable timeframe.</paragraph>
