  <narrative>PORTLAND, OREGON PROMOTES CYCLING -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2866]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Following up on my good friend, I'm glad he mentioned bicycles, because there are some people in America that are doing something to provide more choices to Americans, to burn calories instead of fossil fuels. I am pleased that my community, Portland, Oregon, was just designated a "platinum level bicycle-friendly city," the highest rating granted by the League of American Bicyclists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Portland celebrates three decades of consistently applying policies that promote cycling, and the third consecutive year of double digit growth in bicycle ridership. This makes a big difference for real life people. It's why Portlanders are nine times more likely to ride a bicycle that the average American, and part of the rich choice menu for Portlanders with cars and transit and bicycles that ends up having them drive 20 percent less than the average American family. That translates into a  savings of $2,500 a year per family that they can spend on education, on housing, on entertainment, on investing back into the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would suggest that it's time to celebrate choices, and I'm proud that Portland, Oregon, has decided to give cyclists the choices they deserve and is being honored for that effort.</paragraph>
