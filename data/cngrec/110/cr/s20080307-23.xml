  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO LAURIE SULLIVAN -- (Senate - March 07, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1736">S1736</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I speak today in tribute to a friend, Laurie Sullivan, who passed away late last month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Laurie was a lawyer, a legislative advocate, and a business leader. I admired Laurie professionally and personally. But I was not alone, because everyone admired Laurie.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Laurie was a cut above the rest. Washington is a place where people can lose their way. Not Laurie. She was grounded. And she was centered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Laurie stood out because she was in it for the right reasons. She built a well-respected consulting firm, because she cared about good policy. She cared about making Government work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People admired Laurie for her intelligence, her wit, and her graciousness. She was a breath of fresh air. A veteran of Capitol Hill, Laurie was confident enough to take her work seriously, but not so much that she couldn't laugh or share a joke.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People were drawn to Laurie because she was the kind of person who gave energy. She didn't take it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nothing made Laurie happier than being with her family. She talked about her nieces and nephews frequently. Her face lit up each time she mentioned their latest activities or accomplishments. She was proud of them. And she treasured the time that she spent with them. She described trips with her family as priceless memories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Laurie was also a very generous person. And her generosity was not limited to her family. She gave generously of her time and resources to her community and her friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She worked with a local mentoring program focusing on teenagers who had experienced a death in the family. She hired a student from the University of Virginia at Wise. The student worked at her firm for the summer. Laurie gave him a laptop computer. She helped him pay his college bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Laurie also gave advice. She counseled her nieces and nephews. She counseled the students whom she mentored. She recommended strategies for her clients. And she counseled women who were starting a business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She gave her views on healthcare and politics to me and other Senators who were lucky enough to be part of her circle of friends. Her advice was always solid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When her nieces and nephews followed her advice, they prospered. Laurie's business grew, because her clients learned that she was right. The students she mentored succeeded in college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Laurie was truly a wonderful person. She knew what was most important in this world. And she made the most of it while she was with us. We should all be so lucky as to live that way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
