  <narrative>NOMINATION OF JUDGE MUKASEY -- (Senate - September 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11536">S11536</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the President nominated Judge  Michael Mukasey to be our Nation's 81st Attorney General. He has impressive credentials. I look forward to learning more about his record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this regard, the Judiciary Committee should promptly hold hearings on his nomination, carefully examine his record, and vote in a timely manner. For the past several months our Democratic colleagues have told us we need to install new leadership at the Justice Department and that we "can't afford to wait," in their words</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A successful nominee, they have told us, is someone with integrity and experience, who respects the rule of law and who can hit the ground running. The senior Senator from New York has assured us that he and his colleagues would not obstruct or impede someone with these qualifications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Mukasey appears to be just such a nominee. He is a former Federal prosecutor and Federal judge with extensive experience, especially in terrorism-related matters. He served on the Federal trial bench for 19 years, and for the last 6 years of his career he has been the chief judge on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He presided over the 1993 World Trade Center bombing case, in which he was widely respected for his equanimity, intelligence, and deep appreciation for the complex legal issues at stake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The prosecutor, Andrew McCarthy, recently wrote a compelling first-hand account of Judge Mukasey's conduct in that case for the National Review. I ask unanimous consent to have the article printed at the close of my remarks.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>

    <paragraph>In the article, Mr. McCarthy notes the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, after upholding Judge Mukasey's work, took the highly unusual step of praising his handling of the case. Here is what the court of appeals wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The trial judge, the Honorable Michael B. Mukasey, presided with extraordinary skill and patience, assuring fairness to the prosecution and to each defendant and helpfulness to the jury. His was an outstanding achievement in the face of challenges far beyond those normally endured by a trial judge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Mukasey has earned the deep respect and admiration of the lawyers who have appeared before him and of the many other public servants who have observed and studied his work. His intelligence, experience, and fairmindedness would seem to make him an ideal candidate to lead the Justice Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the very least, these qualities warrant timely and fair consideration of his nomination by the Judiciary Committee. Unfortunately, recent press reports, including a Roll Call article from just a couple of hours ago, indicate that at least some Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are more interested in dragging out this nomination than in installing new leadership at the Justice Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have said they might hold Judge Mukasey's nomination hostage in order to extract still more administration documents in the U.S. attorneys matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This would be extremely unfortunate. By injecting politics into the confirmation process, committee Democrats would be turning their backs on earlier public comments that installing new leadership at the Department was of critical importance. They would be turning their backs on earlier public assurances that they would not obstruct or impede--again their words--a nominee with Judge Mukasey's qualities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now is the chance for our Democratic colleagues to prove they were serious when they cried out for new leadership at the Justice Department by following Senate precedent, weighing the nominee's qualifications, and voting in a timely fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would hope they would not hold him hostage, forgetting the words of the senior Senator from New York, who has told us:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Nation needs a new Attorney General and it cannot afford to wait.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In these times, it is especially important that the Senate act promptly. We are at war, and as the distinguished ranking member has noted: Apart from the Defense Department, no department of the executive branch is more important to defending our Nation than the Department of Justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to act. Now, I understand that Judge Mukasey will begin his courtesy visits tomorrow with Members of the Senate. I am hopeful my colleagues will be able to meet with him so the Senate can begin considering his nomination as soon as reasonably possible.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Judge Mukasey Would Make a Stellar Attorney General; A Gifted Former Prosecutor and Renowned Jurist Could Be Just the Right Fit.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(By Andrew C. McCarthy)</narrative>
  <narrative>It is not exaggeration to say that the United States Department of Justice is among the handful of our nation's most important institutions. It is the fulcrum of our rule of law.</narrative>
  <narrative>The department must be above reproach. It must enforce our laws without fear or favor. It must be the place the courts, the Congress and the American people look to without hesitation for the most unflinching recitation of fact and the most reliable construction of law. Creativity is welcome--it is the department's proud boast always to be home for some of the world's most creative legal minds. Defense of executive prerogatives is also essential--for the department is not the servant but the  peer of the judges and lawmakers before whom it appears, with its first fidelity to the Constitution. Creativity, however, is not invention, and prerogative is not partisanship.</narrative>
  <narrative>The department must foremost be the Department of Justice. Its emblem is integrity. We can argue about where the law should take us, in what direction it should evolve. We must first, however, be able to know what it is. For that, we must be able to rely without question on the department and its leader, the attorney general.</narrative>
  <narrative>President Bush is about to select a new attorney general at a particularly tempestuous time. In today's Washington, even national security has not been spared from our fulminating politics. In the cross-fire, we need stalwart leadership of incontestable competence and solid mooring in the department's highest traditions. Without it, a growing crisis of confidence will grip not only the courts but field prosecutors across the nation.</narrative>
  <narrative>To address such a crisis, the President is fortunate to have several able candidates. One I know particularly well, though you may not, would instantly restore the department's well-deserved reputation for rectitude, scholarship, vision and sober judgment. He is Michael B. Mukasey.</narrative>
  <narrative>I had the privilege of appearing before Judge Mukasey for nearly three years, from 1993 into 1996, when, as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York, I led the prosecution of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman and eleven other jihadists who had waged a terrorist war against the United States--bombing the World Trade Center, plotting to strike other New York City landmarks (including the United Nations complex, the FBI's lower Manhattan headquarters, U.S. military installations, and  the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels), and conspiring political assassinations against American and foreign leaders.</narrative>
  <narrative>The case was bellwether for 9/11 and its aftermath, presenting all the complex and, at times, excruciating issues we deal with today: the obscure lines a free society must draw between religious belief and religiously motivated violence, between political dissent and the summons to  savagery, between due process for accused criminals with a right to present their defense and the imperative to shield precious intelligence from incorrigible enemies bent on killing us.</narrative>
  <narrative>The trial was probably the most important one ever witnessed by . . . nobody. In an odd quirk of history, our nine-month proceeding began at the same time as, and ended a day before, the infamous O.J. Simpson murder trial. While Americans were riveted to a televised three-ring circus in California, Judge Mukasey, in his meticulous yet decisive way, was demonstrating why our judicial system is the envy of the world: carefully crafting insightful opinions on the proper balance between national  security and civil liberties, permitting the government to introduce the full spectrum of its evidence but holding it rigorously to its burden of proof and its ethical obligations; managing a complex litigation over defense access to classified information; and developing jury instructions that became models for future national-security cases.</narrative>
  <narrative>All the defendants were convicted, and the sentencing proceedings, complicated by the need to apply novel federal guidelines to a rarely used, Civil War era charge of seditious conspiracy, ended in the imposition of appropriately lengthy jail terms. No one, however, could contend that the case had not been an exemplar of our system at its best. Indeed, in an unusual encomium, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, upon scrutinizing and upholding the judge's work, was moved to observe:</narrative>
  <narrative>"The trial judge, the Honorable Michael B. Mukasey, presided with extraordinary skill and patience, assuring fairness to the prosecution and to each defendant and helpfulness to the jury. His was an outstanding achievement in the face of challenges far beyond those normally endured by a trial judge."</narrative>
  <narrative>No one should have been surprised. By the time the Blind Sheikh's trial was assigned to him, Judge Mukasey had already forged a reputation as one of America's top trial judges. (In my mind, he is peerless.) That was so because he was also one of America's most brilliant lawyers. From humble beginnings in the Bronx, he had earned his bachelor's degree at Columbia before graduating from Yale Law School in 1967. As a judge, he tolerated nothing but the best effort from prosecutors because he had,  himself, been a top prosecutor. He well understood the enormous power in the hands of young assistant U.S. attorneys, the need to temper it with reason and sound judgment. He grasped implicitly and conveyed by example that the great honor of being a lawyer for the United States Department of Justice is that no one gets, or should expect to get, an award for being honest and forthright. It is a realm where those attributes are assumed.</narrative>
  <narrative>In 1988, Michael Mukasey left a lucrative private law practice when President Ronald Reagan appointed him to the federal bench. He was exactly the credit to his court and his country that the President had anticipated. Quite apart from terrorism matters, he handled thousands of cases, many of them high-stakes affairs, with skill and quiet distinction. In his final years on the bench before returning to private practice, he was the Southern District's chief judge, putting his stamp on the court--especially  in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. Through the sheer force of his persistence and his sense of duty, the court quickly reopened for business despite being just a few blocks away from the carnage. Indeed, it never really closed--Judge Mukasey</narrative>
  <narrative>Characteristically, the judge ensured that the Justice Department was able to do its vital work in a manner that would withstand scrutiny when the heat of the moment had cooled. Judges, himself included, made themselves available, day and night, to review applications for warrants and other lawful authorization orders--no one would ever claim that in his besieged district, crisis had trumped procedural regularity. And as investigators detained material witnesses and scrambled to determine whether  they were mere information sources or actual terror suspects, Judge Mukasey made certain that there was a lawful basis for detention, that detainees were represented by counsel fully apprised of that basis, and that the proceedings were kept on a tight leash--under strict judicial supervision, with detainees promptly released unless there was an independent reason to charge them with crimes.</narrative>
  <narrative>Judge Mukasey's mastery of national security issues, reflecting a unique fitness to lead the Justice Department in this critical moment of our history, continued to manifest itself after 9/11. He deftly handled the enemy-combatant detention of Jose Padilla (recently convicted of terrorism crimes), forcefully endorsing the executive branch's wartime power to protect the United States from an al Qaeda operative dispatched to our homeland to conduct mass-murder attacks, but vindicating the American  citizen's constitutional rights to counsel and to challenge his detention without trial through habeas corpus. Later, in accepting the Federal Bar Council's prestigious Learned Hand Medal for excellence in federal jurisprudence, Judge Mukasey spoke eloquently</narrative>
  <narrative>At this moment in time, the nation would be best served by an attorney general who would bring the department instant credibility with the courts and Congress, provide a needed shot in the arm for prosecutors craving a reminder of the department's proud traditions, and reassure the public of the administration's commitment to the department's high standards. There are precious few people who fit that bill, and of them, Michael Mukasey may be the least well known nationally. But he is as solid  as they come. Our country would be well served if he were asked, once again, to answer its call.</narrative>
