    <paragraph>Mr. President, section 306 of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, the 2008 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the aggregates, allocations, and other appropriate levels for legislation that would make higher education more accessible and more affordable, provided that the legislation does not worsen the deficit over the period of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2017.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find that the conference report for <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, satisfies the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund for higher education. Therefore, pursuant to section 306, I am adjusting the aggregates in the 2008 budget resolution, as well as the allocation provided to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill> be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
