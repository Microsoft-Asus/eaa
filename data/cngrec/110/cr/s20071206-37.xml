  <narrative>REMEMBERING GEORGE OSMOND -- (Senate - December 06, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14841">S14841</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak in honor of a friend of mine, Mr. George Osmond, who, on Thursday, November 6, passed away. While most people will likely remember George as the patriarch of one of our Nation's most famous entertainment families, he should also be remembered as a great humanitarian and entrepreneur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>George was born in 1917 in Star Valley, WY. As a young man, in 1941, he enlisted in the Army and served honorably during World War II. In 1944, he was stationed at the U.S. Army's General Depot in Ogden, UT, where he met his wife, Olive May Davis. George and Olive were married in December 1944 and had nine children, eight boys and one girl.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To most, George's early professional life was quite normal. He began his career selling real estate and life insurance. He later took a position as the Ogden Postmaster. During that time, his sons began to study music; George taught them to sing barbershop and helped them get invitations to perform at community events. His family first entered the national spotlight when four of his sons, Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay, formed a quartet known as "the Osmond Brothers" and began performing at Disneyland  and on The Andy Williams Show.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, seven of his nine children would perform a variety of music styles all over the world. All counted, the Osmond family has recorded 142 albums, selling 100 million copies with 51 gold and platinum recordings. George, himself, worked as the manager of his children's music careers, working to make sure they remained grounded and focused on the importance of family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the lesser known facts about the Osmond family is that two of the Osmond children, the oldest sons Virl and Tom, were born deaf. While these two sons were never music performers, they were closely involved with their father's charitable efforts, working with him to establish The Osmond Foundation, which later became the Children's Miracle Network.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Children's Miracle Network is now headquartered in Salt Lake City and has, to date, raised more $3 billion, which is distributed directly to a network of 170 hospitals. These funds are raised specifically for children's hospitals, medical research and community awareness of children's health issues. It is the largest organization of its kind in the world and is, in addition to their many children and grandchildren, George and Olive Osmond's greatest legacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I knew George Osmond for many years. He was, above all else, devoted to his family and a man of integrity. I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunities I have had over the years to work with him and his family on several charitable endeavors. George was truly a remarkable man who leaves a long legacy here with us in his passing. I want to express my deepest condolences to George's family and thank them for their wonderful example of service.</paragraph>
