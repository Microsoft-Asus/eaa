  <narrative>EXTENDING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD FOR ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5487]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, nearly one in five unemployed Americans have lost their unemployment benefits because it has taken them longer than 26 weeks to find a new job. Obviously, most companies are laying off. Imagine not having a job, losing unemployment benefits, and then trying to pay for gas at the pump and food at the grocery store.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Democratic Congress knows it is tougher to find a job when the economy is not producing them. That is why we passed legislation last week giving these workers an additional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of Texas, there are more than 45,000 workers who have already exhausted their unemployment insurance and 115,000 more that are expected to exhaust their benefits by March of next year. This legislation would help all of these people. But President Bush and his Republican allies here in the House oppose our efforts, even though the President supported a similar extension back in 2002 when the economic situation is not nearly as bad as it is now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, millions of American workers need help from this Congress today. Washington Republicans should reconsider their opposition to this important legislation.</paragraph>
