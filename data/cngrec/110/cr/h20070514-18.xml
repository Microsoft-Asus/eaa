    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="385">H. Res. 385</bill>, which recognizes National AmeriCorps Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since Congress created AmeriCorps in 1994, the program has generated numbers that are impressive by any measure. In 13 years, AmeriCorps has mobilized 1.5 million volunteers in every State in the Union, accumulating nearly 700 million hours of service, a value of $12 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, AmeriCorps volunteers have earned more than $1 billion in scholarships for that service. My home State of Kentucky has benefited from 7 million of the service hours from nearly 5,000 volunteers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Few Federal programs can quantify this type of success across the board, but the numbers would be meaningless were it not for the tremendous impact these hours and all those volunteers have made on countless lives throughout our communities. In my district in Louisville, that impact can be felt throughout the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see it on the optimistic face of a young girl who recently found new reasons to smile, thanks to her mentor from Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Kentuckiana. We feel it walking through a Portland neighborhood, freshly cleaned and painted by volunteers participating in the second annual Martin Luther King Season of Service. You hear it in the voice of a boy proudly reading his first book to his mother, who would not have been able to provide adequate education if not for the AmeriCorps Every 1 Reads  program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There can be no doubt that in our world, the ways these lives have been touched is exceptional. But in AmeriCorps, by providing resources to Court Appointed Special Advocates, Habitat For Humanity, Kentucky Domestic Violence Association, and other educational and non-profit services, these successes are the norm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They happen every day all across the country over and over again, because this unique and ambitious government initiative provides the catalyst for selfless Americans of all backgrounds to push the limits for our capacity of service, and turn awareness into action, compassion and commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AmeriCorps members live every day with the understanding that when we act as one for progress, we progress together. Yet all too often, these life-changing individuals and community building programs go unrecognized. So I ask all my colleagues to join me for the next 7 days in honoring all AmeriCorps members and alumni, to say thanks for all that they have done and continue to do and to encourage more people to get involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the remainder of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 385, which recognizes National AmeriCorps Week. This first ever National AmeriCorps Week gives us an opportunity to acknowledge the impact of AmeriCorps members, alumni and community partners around the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we recognize National AmeriCorps Week, we are reminded of the spirit of service that is such an integral part of our national character. Throughout our country, countless individuals of all backgrounds and ages engage in community service every day to address the common concerns of our neighborhoods, communities, Nation and the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our community has seen the inspiring example of citizens' willingness to serve others in the wake of tragedies large and small that touch our lives  every day. But community service is also about lifting a hand to help a neighbor, teaching a child to read, restoring a neglected park and other numerous acts of goodwill that reaffirm our common humanity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month, we celebrated National Volunteer Week and learned that more than a quarter of this country's population volunteered in some capacity from September 2005 to September 2006, at an estimated value of $280 billion. These numbers are a clear indication of our commitment to service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AmeriCorps is part of that commitment. As this resolution says, AmeriCorps provides 75,000 citizens of this country opportunities to engage in work to improve our communities each year. In total, 500,000 individuals have become AmeriCorps members since the program began and have engaged in 630 million hours of work to help improve the lives of their fellow citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AmeriCorps works closely with a number of community partners across the country, and I also want to express my thanks to those organizations and their leaders. These organizations capture the spirt of service and bring that spirit to bear in a concentrated way to relieve suffering, provide opportunities to the needy, clean up our communities and bring hope to millions. These organizations and the public and private partners that support them provide the needed infrastructure to support the energy  of our community service providers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As this resolution states, National AmeriCorps Week will continue our efforts to raise awareness of the importance of service in local, national and international communities, and the commitment of our community service providers to improving lives, strengthening communities and fostering civic engagement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague from Kentucky for introducing this resolution, and I urge its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentlelady from California, and cochair of the National Service Caucus, the distinguished Ms. Matsui.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400663" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank my good friend from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth) for yielding me time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank Chairwoman McCarthy and Ranking Member Platts for their leadership in the committee and their tireless efforts to reauthorize and strengthen the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be part of those standing up in support of the first ever AmeriCorps Week. I believe strongly that the AmeriCorps program embodies the spirit of the American people, and it's important for Members of Congress to acknowledge the work accomplished by AmeriCorps members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a cochair of the National Service Caucus, it's a pleasure to highlight and honor the tremendous work of those involved at every level and every program of AmeriCorps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AmeriCorps is a national service program that engages Americans of all ages and backgrounds in service. Since AmeriCorps was established in 1994, AmeriCorps members have performed over 630 million hours of service addressing a critical need in education, housing, public safety, disaster response and recovery and environmental preservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps, popularly known as NCCC, has a campus in my congressional district in Sacramento. I have had the opportunity to see firsthand how the experience positively influences the communities served by the team members and how it also enriches the lives of the participants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly everywhere I go in Sacramento someone stops me and tells me about how amazing and committed the NCCC members are to their mission. Most recently I have heard from AmeriCorps members about their experiences in the gulf coast recovery efforts. These participants all remarked that they are not just rebuilding communities, they are, quite literally, rebuilding people's lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is because of all of the great work of AmeriCorps members that extraordinary things are happening all around America. Just last week, I learned that the Child Abuse Prevention Council, an important program in my district, will receive support from AmeriCorps. AmeriCorps members will serve as home visitors, resource aides and community coordinators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is nothing more important than our children, and I appreciate the Corporation for National and Community Service and for providing the program with 96 AmeriCorps members to help them carry out their mission. I know that we will be hearing more about the great work of AmeriCorps as the 110th Congress proceeds, and we consider reauthorization and funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AmeriCorps members are a vital part of our communities. With very little funding, they leverage millions of dollars and perform crucial work, whether in a classroom, in a national park, or rebuilding houses on the gulf coast. I truly hope that my colleagues will continue to support AmeriCorps programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The spirit of service that is so important in our communities is one that should be encouraged. I want to extend my greatest appreciation to those who have served and continue to serve in the AmeriCorps programs throughout the country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Loebsack).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412209" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 385, a bill to recognize National AmeriCorps Week, and the importance of the contributions made by AmeriCorps volunteers across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The goal of AmeriCorps is one of the most noble. AmeriCorps enables each and every individual who is interested in giving of their time and talents to do just that. AmeriCorps members provide service to address our country's most pressing needs, including improving education, working to protect our environment, fighting poverty, ending homelessness and much more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Margaret Meade said, "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has." Since 1994, AmeriCorps has supported over 500,000 people who have contributed nearly 700 million hours of service to local communities. These are individuals who truly embody Margaret Meade's words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are committed individuals who are helping to change our world for the better. The dedication and passion of these volunteers is admirable. I am proud that there are so many Americans who believe that volunteerism is important and necessary. In fact, it's the very foundation of our democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iowa is lucky to have a strong AmeriCorps presence. Iowa nonprofits rely heavily on volunteers to carry out their missions. Between 2003 and 2005, Iowa volunteers contributed nearly 300 million hours of volunteer service to organizations in the State. In 2005 alone, the economic impact of volunteer service to Iowa charitable organizations was over $1.78 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My district is lucky to have Senior Corps programs, AmeriCorps programs and Learn and Serve in both Iowa City and Van Buren Community School Districts. The Iowa Commission on Volunteer Service wants to increase volunteer presence across the State, and I fully support this goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution is both necessary and important. Congress and the Nation should be proud of AmeriCorps members and alumni. We must also raise awareness about the importance of national and community service and encourage individuals to participate in service opportunities in their communities, including in AmeriCorps programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">

  <speaking speaker="412211" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have just heard many ways in which AmeriCorps has benefited our communities and touched so many lives within them. Still, these are just a few of the many stories that illustrate the spectacular influence that AmeriCorps has had on our Nation in a little over a decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The outstanding individuals who have contributed over the years deserve our thanks and recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I am proud to stand here today and urge the passage of <bill type="hr" number="385">H. Res. 385</bill> and ask my colleagues to join me these next 7 days in honoring all that AmeriCorps has already accomplished and encourage others to join in their commitment to continue that work in the years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to commend both Congresswoman Matsui and Congressman Platts of Pennsylvania, the cochairs of the National Service Caucus, for their leadership in these efforts.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="385">H. Res. 385</bill>, which supports the goals and ideals of National AmeriCorps Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week AmeriCorps celebrates its 500,000th member and we celebrate the achievement of all the members of AmeriCorps from around the country who have given 637 million hours of their time and energy to their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AmeriCorps members have made important contributions addressing our Nation's most pressing needs and set an example of selfless service and giving in support of our country's most vulnerable residents--the homeless, hungry, elderly, at-risk youth and disabled. Their work not only supports their communities, but encourages others to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I still remember how I felt as a 14-year-old watching the 1960 Presidential election between Vice President Richard Nixon and Senator John Kennedy. I felt energized listening to Senator Kennedy when he spoke of the Peace Corps and making the world a better and safer place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to be part of his vision--I wanted to give to the world community. Years later, that dream was fulfilled when my wife Betsi and I served 2 years in the Peace Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The same powerful emotion--the same sense of energy and eagerness we felt in the sixties--is alive today and expressed through those who give back to their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my own state of Connecticut, over 7,000 resident have served in AmeriCorps. Those members serving in AmeriCorps in Connecticut have earned over $17 million in Segal AmeriCorps Education Award scholarships to use for college or to pay off student loans. Nationwide, over $1.2 billion has been earned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 8.5 million hours of service have been performed by the residents of Connecticut to assist community nonprofits groups. Those hours equate to nearly $200 million in value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful we are considering this resolution and urge its adoption.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during the first ever AmeriCorps week I would like to extend my support to the oranization and all of the great things that its members have done. Since AmeriCorps was created in 1994, Texas has benefited from over 22,000 young people serving a year or more in our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 72 AmeriCorps volunteers have tutored 691 youths in the State of Texas including the Dallas Habitat for Humanities and the YMCA of Dallas Oak Cliff Branch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Texas, as in other States, AmeriCorps volunteers provide a host of services including building affordable housing, teaching computer skills to youth and seniors, and managing after-school programs aimed at youngsters who might otherwise drop out of school. Through programs such as the "National Civilian Community Corps" or "City Year," AmeriCorps volunteers address critical Texas needs in education, public safety, disaster response and recovery, and environment preservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These programs serve an important role as they provide an outlet for people to serve their country in a manner that they previously had not be afforded. The AmeriCorps program has done great things for Texas and the country as a whole, as the Corps members promise to do in the pledge they take every day, they "get things done."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we will not find common ground or reach higher ground if we turn national service into a partisan playground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will continue to work hard and do everything I can to strengthen this program, and I ask my House colleagues to do everything as well.</paragraph>
