    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader yielding for the purpose of commenting for a moment about the guest Chaplain who just delivered the prayer, who happens to be the chaplain of my church in Paradise Valley. Let me speak a few words about Tim Smith and his service to our congregation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is the associate director of Congressional Ministries at Valley Church, and his expertise is ministries throughout the community. He has been a pastoral minister for over 25 years, serving as a hospice chaplain, a prison chaplain, and a bereavement counselor. In addition, he is a certified spiritual director and mentor and teacher to those who study spiritual direction. Tim and his wife Rita are members of Valley Presbyterian Church. They are parents of two sons, one of whom, incidentally,  interned in my office in Phoenix, AZ.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also a special privilege for a guest Chaplain to be here, and I express my appreciation also to our Chaplain, Dr. Barry Black, for his willingness and kindness in inviting Tim Smith to be with us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I welcome Tim Smith, Minister of Valley Presbyterian Church, to Washington and to the Senate.</paragraph>
