    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400160" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation that provides a 3-month extension to the transitional medical assistance program under Medicaid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TMA provides vital support for low-income American families moving off welfare and into work. Under the TMA program, families whose earnings would otherwise make them ineligible for Medicaid can receive up to 12 months of Medicaid coverage. Without TMA, many families transitioning from welfare to work would go without health insurance and could end up back on welfare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Families leaving welfare often encounter difficulties such as securing health insurance because they have taken low-wage jobs that do not offer employer-sponsored health coverage. In some cases this choice could serve as a deterrent to returning to work, and we want to provide folks with as many incentives as possible to return to work. According to the Congressional Research Service, 79 percent of people with incomes of at least 200 percent of the Federal poverty level benefit from employer-sponsored  health insurance, yet only 19 percent of working-age individuals with incomes below the poverty line receive health care coverage through employment. These are folks who earn $10,210 or less a year. If they can't get coverage through their employer, it is essentially cost-prohibitive for them to purchase health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one should be made to choose between a job and health insurance. Thanks to TMA, many Americans are spared this tough choice and allowed to move off welfare and into a job while maintaining their health coverage. Without TMA, many of our most vulnerable Americans would be unable to access the health coverage they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my State of Texas, TMA helps provide more than 111,000 people each month continued treatment for ongoing health care needs. A gap in care would be particularly problematic for the one out of four mothers in the program who are in poor or fair health yet transitioning from welfare to work. The extensions of the program is critical to their continued access to necessary health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again in Texas, TMA also reimburses medical providers for more than $300 million in annual expenses for acute medical care, prescription drugs, and other approved Medicaid services. Without TMA, these costs for medically necessary services would be shifted to local governments or charitable organizations, or worse, the client may not receive needed care at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, TMA enjoys wide-ranging bipartisan support. The National Governors Association strongly supports TMA and its extension. According to the National Governors Association, "without access to regular health care, health problems of a new worker or the worker's family members are likely to lead to greater absenteeism and possibly job loss."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TMA is also supported by the National Conference of State Legislatures, the American Public Health Association, and the National Association of State Medicaid Directors. The administration also supports this vital program as evidenced by the fact that the President included a 1-year extension of TMA in his fiscal year 2008 budget proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in the past Congress has always acted in bipartisan fashion to extend TMA in combination with an equal extension of Federal abstinence education programs. While there is no shortage of debate or opinion on the merits of abstinence education programs, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this approach, at least for the short term, so we can ensure that hardworking American families don't lose their health care under  the transitional  medical assistance program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400076" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This statement that I am about to read is the statement of Congressman JOE BARTON, the distinguished gentleman from Texas, who I am told is in transit and is not able to be here:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the bill before us today, which extends the programs of transitional medical assistance and the title V abstinence education program. I am pleased that the Congress is able to work together to extend funding for these programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe it is important that we support the goals of abstinence education and not get bogged down by the politics that inevitably surround the concept. Our school children deserve the opportunity to receive an education regarding the merits of an abstinent life-style. Title V funds are optional for States, and it does not prohibit the funding and teaching of contraceptive-based programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Abstinence education provides teens the opportunities to learn about the ramifications of sexual activity including pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. As I am sure many of my colleagues would attest, I have heard from numerous programs within my State, and I am sure in the State of Texas from where Mr. Barton hails, that rely on this Federal funding. They believe in the program and hope to continue providing abstinence education opportunities to local teens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to reiterate my support for this bill and encourage my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
