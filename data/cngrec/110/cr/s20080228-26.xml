  <speaking speaker="400064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor the memory of David William Summerfield, a husband, father, soldier, pilot, and a beloved member of the Cumberland community. Dave died on February 21, piloting a small plane from Charleston, WV, to Cumberland. Also lost was his passenger, Rob Kessel of Bel Air, MD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dave Summerfield's death has been a blow to the entire community and to all who knew him. A graduate of Allegany High School, Dave dedicated himself to the service of our Nation by joining the U.S. Air Force in 1951. During his distinguished military career, he was awarded the Bronze Star Service Medal, Air Force Meritorious Service Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal, Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with V for Valor, Vietnam Service Medal with four campaign stars, and RVN Honor Medal First  Class with Gold Palm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1972, he returned to his childhood home in Rawlings after retiring from the Air Force. There he and his wife, Jessie Marie, raised a family of five children and started an aviation business. His greatest joy in life was his family; his second greatest joy was flying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dave was a certified Airline Transport Pilot, ATP, the highest grade of pilot certification that the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, can bestow. He and Jessie Marie founded Summerfield Aviation, an FAA-approved pilot school, Air Charter and Aerial Photography Service located at the Cumberland Regional Airport. During his 35 years as a pilot, he logged thousands of hours and provided flight instruction to hundreds of students. He was beloved by his students, many of whom joined the search  for his plane when they learned it was missing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also understood the need to give back to the community. He served as a deacon and was on the board of directors of the Grace Bible Fellowship in Short Gap, WV. He also was a member of the Calvary Baptist Church in Cresaptown. During the last year of his life, he led a Bible study with prisoners at the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal note, Dave's youngest son, Robin, is a valuable member of my staff, as my field representative for the western part of Maryland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on behalf of the citizens of Maryland and members of the U.S. Senate, I wish to extend our sincerest condolences to the family of Dave Summerfield. He was a great American who was an inspiration to all who knew him.</paragraph>
