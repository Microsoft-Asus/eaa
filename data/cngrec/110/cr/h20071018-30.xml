    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, Memphis, Tennessee and the Nation lost a great photographer and a great public personage in Ernest Withers. Ernest Withers died at the age of 85. He was a gentleman who was at the right time at the right place with the camera that took the picture that showed the civil rights movement, showed the history of Memphis, Tennessee and its progress from segregation to integration to a city that's one of America's great cities today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Withers was one of the first African Americans hired as a police officer in the city of Memphis in 1949. He left that profession and went into photography. And whenever there was an event, Mr. Withers was there. He took a picture of B.B. King and Elvis together on Beale Street. The King and the King together on Beale, back in about 1956, when B.B. was thin enough that you wouldn't recognize him, and Elvis was thin too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He had pictures of Dr. King and the civil rights movement. He covered Oxford, Mississippi; he covered Medgar Evers. He covered all of the major civil rights events that came throughout the mid-South.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was published in People Magazine and the New York Times, and Ebony and Jet, and was honored by the Memphis College of Art with an honorary degree in 1992, and by the Missouri School of Journalism for his great work in photography.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He'll be missed in Memphis, and his collection needs to be maintained and made available to all citizens for remembrance of what went on during the civil rights era. He'll be missed by all of us. He'll be remembered in history books and museums.</paragraph>
