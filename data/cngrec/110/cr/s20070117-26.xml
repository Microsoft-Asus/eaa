    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mayor William T. McLaughlin. Bill, as he is affectionately called by his friends--and Bill has a lot of friends--celebrated his 90th birthday on December 22, 2006. During the 90 years that the world has been blessed with Bill's presence, he and his late wife Mary have touched many lives and helped countless people. His contributions have ranged from serving his country during World War II, serving the city of Wilmington for two terms as the  city's mayor and for 12 years on the city council before that, and offering continued service with numerous community projects both before and after his tenure in elected office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>William T. McLaughlin was born on December 22, 1916, on Wilmington's east side. One of 12 children, Bill often joked that the Great Depression helped to raise his family's standard of living. When Bill was 16 years old, his father lost his job. Bill's devotion to his family led to his dropping out of high school in order to accept a job cleaning the Boy's Club in Wilmington's Browntown neighborhood. He then went to work at a linoleum plant where, after being turned down for a two-cent raise,  he helped organize a union for the plant employees. This type of initiative would be a hallmark of Bill's life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the age of 22, Bill signed up for the National Youth Administration, a Federal program he hoped would send him to California. Instead, he was assigned to a swamp drainage program in southern Delaware.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After helping to reduce Delaware's mosquito population, Bill decided to seek more adventurous endeavors and joined the Army Air Force during World War II. He trained as an electrical technician and saw action as a radio operator and tail gunner. He was shot down over the skies of New Guinea but managed to survive and went on to complete 50 missions before returning home to Wilmington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon his return, Bill attended night school on the GI bill. During this time, Bill went to work for DuPont, where he would work for 30 years, mostly as a supervisor in the company's business machines section.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was during this time that Bill would meet the woman who would become the love of his life. Mary's enthusiasm and outgoing personality were a good counterpoint to Bill's soft-spoken manner and she would have a huge influence on both his future and the future of Wilmington. Together, they raised two sons, William and Donald.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike many elected officials, Bill did not enter politics until the later years of his life. In 1964, Mary encouraged him to run for Wilmington's 9th ward city council seat. Bill won the election and continued to serve on the city council for 12 years. During this time, he became the council's finance chairman. In 1976, he agreed to seek election as Wilmington's mayor after then-Mayor Tom Maloney decided to run for the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill was elected as Wilmington's mayor and served two terms in that capacity, serving from 1977 until 1984. During this time, his openness and compassion helped him cultivate a renaissance for the city. He held weekly "open door" sessions where any citizen could come by his office and voice their concerns or simply chat about local issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As mayor, he worked with Governor Pete DuPont and other State leaders to develop the Financial Center Development Act, which laid the foundation for Delaware's rebirth as a financial services center. He also helped lead the efforts to recruit dozens of out-of-State banks to set up shop in Delaware, creating more than 30,000 jobs for the First State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his time in office, Mayor McLaughlin helped implement the desegregation of Delaware's public school system in northern Delaware. Bill never forgot the obstacles that he had to overcome during his lifetime and sought to level the playing field for all Delawareans, regardless of the color of their skin. He also increased housing opportunities for people with low incomes, and he worked tirelessly to create new jobs by recruiting potential employers to settle in Wilmington and the surrounding  areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill also played a pivotal role in promoting the Delaware arts community, helping to create the Delaware Theatre Company and the Delaware Center for Contemporary Arts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What stands out most to me--and for a generation of Delaware's political leaders--is Bill's willingness to mentor young people seeking elected office. When I first ran for State treasurer in 1976, Bill was among the first public officials I reached out to. His support and kindness were instrumental in my first campaign and continue to be a source of inspiration for many of Delaware's elected officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After leaving office in 1984, Bill continued to play a vital role in the lives of countless Delawareans. He championed the disadvantaged through his involvement with numerous community service efforts. In 1996, he and Mary founded the William T. and Mary McLaughlin Education Fund, which continues to provide academic support for deserving students in Wilmington and New Castle County. After Mary's passing in 2002, Bill continued their work to help better the lives of their fellow Delawareans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill's hard work and devotion to service have led to countless community service awards. In 1985, on his last day as Wilmington's mayor, Bill was awarded the Josiah Marvel Cup for public service, the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce's most prestigious award. Many people would have seen that award as a capstone, but Bill seemed to view it as a foundation upon which he continues to build his legacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill is a true friend of Delaware. His compassion, integrity, warm sense of humor and vitality of spirit are a true inspiration for us all. I rise today to commend his hard work, to applaud his devotion to community service and to wish him many more happy birthdays in the years to come.</paragraph>
