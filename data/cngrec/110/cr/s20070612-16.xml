  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have reached another tragic milestone in the Iraq war: 3,500 American troops have now been lost. Every one of those 3,500 is a hero. But every brave man and woman who continues to serve and protect us is a hero as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a somber time. At a somber time such as this, words betray our grief and our gratitude. So I ask my colleagues to join me in a moment of silence to honor the memory and sacrifice of every airman, soldier, sailor, and marine we have lost in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, would the clerk report what is now before the Senate or what should be before the Senate.</paragraph>
