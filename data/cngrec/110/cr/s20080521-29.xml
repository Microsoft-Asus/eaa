    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to address some of the critical issues this body faces at this point in history, and to reflect on why these challenges are surmountable if we focus on working together to forge ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are clearly not easy times. We are engaged in a global battle for the future of freedom. We are up against radical Islamic extremists who will do anything they can to annihilate those who do not live and believe their way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At home, we face some daunting questions when it comes to expanding opportunity for all Americans. So do we follow a proven path of tax relief? Can we change the way we educate our children to prepare them for global competition in the 21st century? How do we provide quality health care that is accessible and affordable for all of our families? How do we secure our borders and strengthen legal immigration? Can we come together to make difficult decisions about the future of entitlements before  they bankrupt this country?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we face the task of funding the global war against Islamic extremists, providing our troops with the resources they need and prioritizing funding so we do not incur unnecessary debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, these are tough questions, with serious consequences. But more than two centuries ago, a group of patriots convened to write our Constitution, and they provided the framework for the Government in which we have the honor to serve today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They faced questions we take for granted centuries later but which could only have been resolved by incredible vision and the grace of God.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Delegate James Wilson stated:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>..... we are providing a Constitution for future generations and not merely for the circumstances of the moment. &lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How votes would be apportioned in the Congress was one of the first and most difficult questions this convention tackled. The smaller States wanted an equal vote, and the larger States, obviously, preferred a proportional vote. Some argued that the vote in the lower House should be based on taxes paid. There were threats of breaking up States to make them smaller and more manageable to govern. Decisions had to be made regarding the terms of Members of Congress. How would they be paid? What powers  would be granted to the Government?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Remember, this was a country that had fought its way out from under the control of a powerful monarchy. The Framers of the Constitution were incredibly aware of that fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Great Compromise was the measure that gave every State two Senators. But would foreigners be permitted to serve in the Congress? Where would the seat of Government be? Would officers of the Government be required to swear an oath to support the Constitution? Who would ratify the Constitution--the States or the people?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To think today about the number of decisions and compromises that were made over the course of a summer is humbling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The North Carolina delegates wrote to their Governor:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A very large Field presents to our view without a single Straight or eligible Road that has been trodden by the feet of Nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet great thought, debate, and deliberation went into every single decision. Issues were often revisited time and again before a consensus was painstakingly reached.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Constitution was by no means thrown together quickly or haphazardly. Once decisions were ultimately made about the branches of Government and their powers, a document needed to be artfully drafted to steer the United States in 1787 as well as for generations to come. The product was nothing short of miraculous. Yet the Constitution was still not a done deal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Constitution and its revolutionary ideas had many supporters, but it also faced fierce opposition. It was described as "a most ridiculous piece of business" by some. Those who stood against the Constitution honed in on people's fears. After all, this was a completely experimental government with no proven model to follow. As delegate Davie of North Carolina declared: "It is much easier to alarm people than to inform them."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately for this Nation the constitutionalists prevailed. To study the transformation of a blank slate of hopes and aspirations to a functioning Constitution that would guide a democracy for more than 200 years is awesome. There are several valuable lessons that I wish to share with my colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is difficult to pass legislation today with a closely divided Senate. It was painfully difficult to make decisions about forming a new government and then determine and agree on what should be included in our Constitution. To make progress even more frustrating, a subject already voted on could be reconsidered again the next day and voted on again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But these men did not let the process interfere with their progress. Their experience and their reasonableness  shined during the most difficult days. They understood if they were serious about creating this Constitution, they would have to work together and consider and respect each other's differences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the end, the Constitution was the work of those for it and those against it. They came to many compromises in order to make the final product that all could live with. John Adams described the Constitution as:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If not the greatest exertion of human understanding, the greatest single effort of national deliberation that the world has ever seen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I serve as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, I have always prided myself on reaching across the aisle to work for the common good. For example, my home State of Nevada has greatly benefited from the work Senator Reid and I have done together on several public lands bills. He brings certain people to the table who trust him; I bring others to the table who trust me. We encourage a dialogue that has resulted in crucial legislation for our State. I imagine  this is the kind of give and take that made the Constitution possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another important lesson from the Constitutional Convention was the understanding of the implications that our leaders' words have around the world. There were people who were completely opposed to the Constitution, but they knew how damaging their opinions could be, especially if those opinions were made overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Benjamin Franklin stated:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The opinions I have had of its errors, I sacrificed to the public good. I have never whispered a syllable of them abroad. Within these walls they were born and here they shall die.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this is a critical flaw that is too often made in this body today. Our words have consequences. Today, it is much more difficult to contain what we say. Technology ensures that our enemies have access to the same television shows, Internet sites, and newspapers that our citizens have today. It is naive to think that a debate on the floor about retreating from Iraq has no impact on those plotting against us. It absolutely feeds into their strategy and their hope for our failure and our  demise. We should all remember Benjamin Franklin's approach of working to contain our opinions that may be harmful to our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, there comes a time after a contentious issue when we must come together and move forward. Abraham White, a fierce opponent to the Constitution, gave his word that he would work to convince his constituents to submit to the new law of the land and to live in peace under it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, 220 years ago, the States were in the midst of deciding whether they would ratify the Constitution. It was the pinnacle of a turbulent summer that left many of our delegates amazed at what they had actually achieved. George Washington called it "little short of a miracle." The entire effort, from the first days of the convention to the parades that celebrated the United States and its Constitution, was in fact a miracle. Benjamin Rush, a Philadelphia physician who signed the  Declaration of Independence, described the unparalleled emotion that was shared by all during the Philadelphia celebration of the Fourth of July--even greater than at any wartime victory. His description included the words: "We have become a Nation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is overwhelming to think about the work that was done hundreds of years ago so that we could continue to live and uphold the tenets of an enduring Constitution today. What a remarkable tribute to the delegates of the Convention and to the leaders whose vision led to the ratification of our Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we can keep in mind the many hurdles overcome in 1787 by the Constitutional Convention and the men who were gathered there and come together in drafting a real supplemental that will fund our troops, give our military leaders the tools they need, and show the Nation we are united and that we are committed together in this global war against radical Islamic extremists. We have a tremendous legacy on which to continue building. Let's commit to doing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
