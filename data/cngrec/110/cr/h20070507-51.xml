    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the millions of Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander heritage. I would like to thank my good friend, Congressman Mike Honda, for leading the special orders tonight on Asian Pacific American Heritage Month and providing us with this opportunity to speak to you tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I represent a heavily, heavily populated Asia Pacific community in southern California, I think the second most populated in the country. The first group that makes up a large proportion is Taiwanese and Chinese. The second group is Filipino. I am very proud to have represented them for so many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I am here tonight to pay tribute to the many of them who provide us with public service in government, science, law and business, athletics and in the arts. These communities that I represent are the cities of Monterey Park, Rosemead, West Covina and the San Gabriel Valley. Well over 120,000 individuals represent that district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean and of Cambodian decent. As you know, they work hard, like many immigrants that come to this country. Nearly 30 percent of the minority-owned businesses are owned by Asian Pacific Islanders and African-American women. In recent years, a number of Asian and Pacific Islander women-owned businesses has increased by 69 percent in the district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Chamber of Commerce, Chinese Americans own at least two-thirds of Monterey Park's more than 5,000 businesses. I have long been a supporter of a program called PACE, Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment, which was founded back in 1976 to address the employment and job training needs of Asian Pacific Islanders. Believe it or not, there are many Asian Pacific Islanders who really do need the support of the Federal Government and our various forms of government to help them succeed  in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today it provides workforce development, housing services, business assistance and early childhood education in Los Angeles county. I would especially like to recognize a good friend of mine, Kerry Doi, with whom I have worked for a number of years, whom I am extremely proud of. Earlier this year, his program, known as PACE, and the Association for Enterprise Opportunity Women and Company, chose 10 prominent small business owners to give $1,000 checks to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You may think that's not a lot of money, but for first-time business owners of Asian Pacific descent, it meant a lot. I am proud of the work they are doing to help all small business owners, including those of API heritage, to succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have also worked closely with the East San Gabriel Valley Japanese Community Center and the Monterey Park Langley Senior Center, predominantly of Asian descent. I am proud to have these organizations in my district because they are wonderful places where individuals from this community can gather and have social time, artistic time, recreational time and share their culture with each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the senior center, I meet often with them. They take language courses, computer classes and different exercise courses that help them to keep busy in our community. Many of the seniors and their families and others have been touched by the immigration process recently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, I would say that the second largest case load in my district happened to be individuals of API descent. They, just as much as anyone else, want to become naturalized citizens, and they are stepping up to the plate. I was happy to host a citizenship forum that we held in the City of Irwindale recently, and I would say about 200 or more families of API descent came forward to become naturalized citizens. I am proud that is happening in our community and across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am here to support, again, the efforts of the API caucus, which Mike Honda leads, and to work with my colleagues there on the tri-caucus to help put forward disparities and treatment in health care issues regarding API, the Hispanic community and the African-American community. We are working together to bridge our gaps so that we can provide better services to all Americans in all residents of our country. I am happy and pleased to be able to put this forward tonight in support of  the API caucus.</paragraph>
