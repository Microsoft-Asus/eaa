  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, North Carolina District Attorney Michael Nifong finds himself the accused and not the accuser this week. It seems his overzealous desire to make headlines by appealing to political pandering and making false allegations against three innocent Duke University lacrosse players has landed him in trouble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State Bar Association charged Nifong with making outlandish prejudicial public comments against the players and hiding evidence, and they want him disbarred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Independent special prosecutors have found the sexual assault charges against the players to be unfounded, but Prosecutor Nifong tried to put them in jail anyway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mere accusation of sexual assault, even when false, can ruin an individual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The role of the prosecutor is to seek, not convictions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rouge D.A. Nifong is yet another example of a prosecutor gone wild and an abuser of power. If the allegations against him are true, he joins the wall of shame and should never be allowed near the courthouse again, except maybe as a defendant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because justice is the one thing we should always find.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
