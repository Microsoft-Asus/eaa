  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="HONORING B. LYN BEHRENS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. Lyn Behrens as she retires as president and CEO of Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center, drawing to a close a successful career in medicine and civic leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After completing her degree in medicine from the Sydney University School of Medicine in Australia in 1964, Dr. Behrens became the first and only pediatric resident at Loma Linda University Medical Center in 1966. By 1986, Dr. Behrens was the first female Dean of the School of Medicine, and by 1990 she had become the first female President of Loma Linda University. Five years later she assumed the position of CEO of Adventist Health System, which soon became the Loma Linda University Adventist  Health Science Center. In 1999, Dr. Behrens was chosen to serve as President of Loma Linda University Medical Center. Loma Linda University and Medical Center has prospered under her leadership, and has become a preeminent institution for patient care and medical technology. I have had the pleasure of visiting Loma Linda University and have found Dr. Behrens to be an exemplary model to her colleagues, capable of bringing out the best in her associates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During Behrens' tenure, Loma Linda University witnessed the development of a dedicated children's hospital with the most advanced equipment and methodology. The university has also witnessed the development of a center for behavioral medicine, as well as a rehabilitation, orthopaedic and neurosciences institute. The university has also added new schools of pharmacy and science and technology, and has worked diligently to foster its interaction with local research institutes to develop innovation  in the use of global information systems to assist with emergency medical response. The first hospital-based center for proton therapy and research has also been developed under Behrens' tenure, and has become a leading institution in the treatment of cancer. The university has taken great strides to improve care and support for our Nation's veterans at the Jerry L. Pettis Memorial VA Medical Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Behrens has also been a dynamic leader in her community, working to ensure positive community service to her area and throughout the world. She has been instrumental in bringing to fruition a great number of social and community services organizations and programs. Programs such as the Social Action Community Health Services Clinic, PossAbilities, Community Kids Connection and Operation Jessica, have brought medical and social support to a broad group of individuals. These organizations have  assisted special needs and at-risk children and teens, and developed after-school programs and ESL--English Second Language--programs. Dr. Behrens' leadership has also provided for increased medical and community support internationally, providing support in 12 nations, including the only teaching hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, and the most advanced hospital in mainland China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As she retires from more than four decades of service and leadership in medicine to the communities of California and beyond, I am pleased to ask my colleagues to recognize her for a career of visionary leadership. The future of medical education, research, and service will be forever changed thanks to her bold leadership.</paragraph>
