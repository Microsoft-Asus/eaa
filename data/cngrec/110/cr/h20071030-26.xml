    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we are fast approaching the 1-year anniversary of the November elections when the American people went to the polls demanding to take our Nation in a new direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last 10 months, the new Democratic Congress has produced real results that are now making a real difference in millions of Americans' lives. For 10 years, Republican Congresses have refused to increase the minimum wage for nearly 6 million hardworking Americans. Democrats thought that was unacceptable, and one of our first actions was to ensure that these workers finally got a much-deserved and long overdue pay raise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats also realize it is difficult for middle-class parents to send their children to college. Over the last 6 years as wages have stagnated, college costs have increased 40 percent above inflation. This Democratic Congress passed and the President signed into law legislation that provides the single largest increase in college aid since the GI Bill, and this new law will allow more Americans to live the American Dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, congressional Democrats are proud of these accomplishments, but they are only the beginning as we continue to move America in a new direction.</paragraph>
