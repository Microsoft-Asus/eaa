  <narrative>THE JUSTICE SYSTEM SHOULD FREE BORDER AGENTS IGNACIO RAMOS AND JOSE COMPEAN -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H4128]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, border agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean were the victims of an overzealous and media-hungry Federal prosecutor that seemed to be a political puppet of the Mexican government rather than seeking American justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While patrolling the border, Ramos and Compean shot an illegal trespasser and drug dealer who was smuggling $1 million worth of dope across our border into Texas. Ironically, the two agents were tried for civil rights violations and sent to prison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, a Federal judge said that the prosecution overreacted in this case. Here is what occurred. The drug dealer was given immunity to testify against the agents, and the bought-and-paid-for witness's testimony, believability, and credibility, was the basis of the entire prosecution. But the prosecutor hid from the jury that the drug smuggler witness continued to bring in drugs into the United States while the trial was pending; and the U.S. attorney has now admitted the back-room-deal witness  also lied.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our justice system should free these two border agents because of the lying paid-for witness, and our government needs to get on the right side of the border war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
