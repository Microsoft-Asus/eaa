  <narrative>PRESIDENT'S VETO OF CHIP REAUTHORIZATION -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11757]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am deeply saddened that we have failed to override the President's veto of legislation to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. This action represents a misstep of historic proportions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also saddens me that several Members on the other side applauded when this body failed to override the President's veto. By voting against this bipartisan, bicameral legislation, some Members of Congress have turned their backs on more than 10 million poor children who need health insurance now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear. The legislation that was vetoed today was an excellent piece of legislation, and our children will be worse off without it. The continuing resolution that we passed will temporarily cover children who are currently enrolled in CHIP, but the uncertainty surrounding the program's future leave our children's futures uncertain. Some States are already indicating that they will make cuts to the program if they cannot rely upon a steady Federal funding stream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, the continuing resolution fails to address many of the critically important measures that we included in the reauthorization. Notably, dental, mental, and vision coverage are all absent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need no greater reminder of the need for these provisions than the recent death of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old boy from my home State of Maryland who died when an untreated tooth infection spread to his brain. Yes, he died.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who voted against this bill have ignored the calls of more than 81 percent of the American people and members of the Democratic and Republican Parties who support the initiative. Because of their lapse in judgment, 4 million uninsured children, 65,500 of them from my home State of Maryland, will be denied the coverage that Congress intended to grant them. Further, my colleagues who voted against this bill have shut the doctor's office door on approximately 6 million children who currently  rely on CHIP for health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It chills the conscience to think of all those children who will be forced out of care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is particularly upsetting to consider how this will affect children with chronic disease who rely upon the CHIP benefit to get the care they need to simply survive. Lives are in the balance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bipartisan coalitions, including the National Governors Association and the United States Conference of Mayors, recognize the unique moral obligation we have with this legislation. Earlier this week, Mayor Sheila Dixon of my hometown of Baltimore held a press conference to call on Congress to override the President's veto. She also joined 20 mayors from across the country in signing a letter making the same appeal. Unfortunately, some of our colleagues in this Chamber stubbornly failed to acknowledge  the reality that so many of us have clearly seen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I could talk about the benefits of reauthorizing CHIP as I have in the past statements before this Chamber, but today I will take a different approach by letting my Republican colleagues speak for me. Specifically, Mr. Speaker, I will associate myself with the following comments:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republican Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY of Iowa said, "This is not a government takeover of health care. This is not socialized or nationalized medicine or anything like that."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republican Senator ORRIN HATCH of Utah called the bill "an honest compromise which improves a program that works for America's low-income children."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republican Congressman DON YOUNG of Alaska said, "Issues such as the health and well-being of our Nation's children are nothing to play politics with and nothing to scrimp on."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republican Congressman VITO FOSSELLA of New York said the bill "will put millions of young people on the road to a longer and healthier life."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, finally, Republican Congressman WAYNE GILCHREST from my home State of Maryland expressed his support for the bill, noting, "It focuses on the lowest income kids and fixes a lot of problems with the current program."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I deeply regret that the President and some of our colleagues lack the foresight to recognize the critical importance of passing the CHIP reauthorization. We simply must regroup and pass this vital piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Access to quality care is not a privilege; it is a right. We cannot afford to play politics with our children's lives.</paragraph>
