    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I commend the University of Wyoming Cowgirls on winning the 2007 Women's National Invitation Tournament.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 31, 2007, the University of Wyoming women's basketball team won this exciting national tournament by defeating the University of Wisconsin team by a score of 72-56. They made it to the final by defeating Kansas State in triple overtime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This historic win was the first WNIT championship for the Cowgirls and was witnessed by a record crowd of over 15,000 fans at the University of Wyoming Arena-Auditorium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as any Cowgirl fan can tell you, this victory was the result of months of hard practice, courageous leadership by the players and coaches, and a commitment to excellence both on the court and in the classroom. The teamwork and discipline demonstrated all year by the Wyoming Cowgirls allowed them to be successful on game day. And we do not have to look far to see examples of this success: This year, the Wyoming Cowgirls won the most games in program history, including thrilling late-game comebacks  and overtime wins. Equally as important, however, they earned the respect of women's basketball programs across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to stand here today on the floor of the Senate and congratulate the University of Wyoming Cowgirls on a championship season and recognize the student athletes, coaches, faculty, and fans who were essential in achieving this great victory.</paragraph>
