    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address one of the darkest events of the 20th century, an event that we must not let be forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the First World War and in the final days of the Ottoman Empire, one of the worst atrocities in human history occurred. Even among the chaos and violence of World War I, this atrocity stood out, horrifying foreign witnesses, and prompting Theodore Roosevelt to call it, "the greatest crime of the war." This crime against humanity was the Armenian genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although large-scale violence against Armenians had previously occurred, the events from 1915 to 1918 were truly unprecedented. During this period, approximately 1.5 million Armenians were systematically killed by the Ottoman Government, while the surviving Armenians were left without homes, jobs, possessions, and, most importantly, their loved ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, despite overwhelming evidence that the Ottoman Government actively sought to destroy the Armenian population, this genocide, the first of the 20th century, has been overlooked by the United States. This is simply wrong. Because, to end genocide, we must stand up to it whenever and wherever it occurs. If we do not, we only embolden those who would commit genocide elsewhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1939, while explaining his plan to destroy the Polish population, Adolph Hitler stated, "Who, after all, today speaks of the annihilation of the Armenians?" And many of my Polish brothers and sisters died.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we have the opportunity to speak of the annihilation of the Armenians. We can finally characterize the systematic murder of 1.5 million Ottoman Armenians as genocide, and rightfully condemn those atrocious killings that occurred 90 years ago. The prevention of future genocides may depend on it.</paragraph>
