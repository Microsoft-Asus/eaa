    <paragraph>Mr. Presdient, as my colleagues know, the Senate passed <bill type="s" number="1082">S. 1082</bill>, the FDA Revitalization Act, on May 9 by a near-unanimous vote. The House passed its version of this legislation, <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill>, the FDA Amendments Act, on July 11, also by a near-unanimous vote. Staff of the Senate HELP Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee has worked many, many hours a day, 7 days a week, to get to a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on the FDA reauthorization bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Working together with Senator Enzi, we have already made a great deal of progress. We have reached agreement or near agreement on several titles and have narrowed the gap on most others. Important issues remain to be resolved, but we will do the work we need to do to have an agreement for the House and Senate to consider in September.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank our majority leader, Senator Reid, for his leadership and support throughout this process and for making this important legislation an early priority in the Senate. While we were unable to appoint conferees today, our bipartisan deliberations will continue through August, and I hope we can name conferees in September and finalize this legislation that is so important to the safety and health of all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, from both the House and Senate. They have a deep knowledge of the issues presented by these bills and have been strong advocates of different positions on some of the issues. I believe this process has improved the legislation and will continue to do so and that it will produce an FDA reauthorization bill that the House and Senate can again endorse with broad, bipartisan support.</paragraph>
