  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the plan for General Petraeus' surge was designed to improve Iraq's security so that political and economic progress could follow. Stability measures implemented in violent areas in and around Baghdad and across the nation have produced recognizable results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is an increased security in Iraq, and optimistic reports are traveling back from Members of Congress, war critics, and, yes, even the liberal press. Areas once considered terrorist strongholds are now relatively secure. Progress. Sunni and U.S. forces are working together for victory. Progress. Tribal leaders are turning their backs on terrorist insurgents and helping American forces. Progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week, General Petraeus will deliver a comprehensive report on Iraq and what the surge has produced since he has been on the ground, and I am confident his report will be detailed and honest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the level of progress is evident, and I believe the continued success of the surge will pave the way for the only way out of Iraq: Victory.</paragraph>
