  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize the hard work of Ms. Cindy Chang, Senior Adviser for Budget and Appropriations at the State Department's Bureau of Legislative Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cindy has worked closely with the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Subcommittee for the past several years and has been an invaluable asset to the Congress. Cindy understands the appropriations and budget processes. She understands foreign policy, whether the complexities associated with the Middle East or the nuances of Southeast Asia. Cindy is also extremely responsive to the subcommittee's many and frequent requests for information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice should understand that in the opinion of the Appropriations Committee, Cindy Chang is among the brightest stars at the State Department. As the year draws to a close, my staff joins me in recognizing and thanking Cindy for her outstanding support of the subcommittee in 2007.</paragraph>
