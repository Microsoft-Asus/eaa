  <speaking speaker="400413" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of two Navajo Indians and celebrate the American heroes who passed away last week. Stewart Clah and Charles Guy were members of the elite Navajo Code Talkers. They did not simply rely on their ancestral language to relay critical United States military communications. Rather, the innovative Navajo Code Talkers used their native language to build a succinct and unbreakable code for military communications during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will never know exactly how many American lives were saved or how many American military operations were successful because of their ingenuity and sacrifice. But we do know Stewart Clah and Charles Guy and the rest of the Navajo Code Talkers will forever be remembered as critical to the Allied victory during one of the world's darkest hours.</paragraph>
