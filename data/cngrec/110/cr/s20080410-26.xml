  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak with regard to <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>, the bill we approved earlier this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I wish to acknowledge Chairman Bingaman and Senator Domenici for their great work in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I worked over the last 2, 3 years on many of the bills that are included in this package of land bills we approved this afternoon, it was gratifying to see the bipartisan nature of the Energy Committee working on this legislation which is so important to our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I very much agree that the process that historically has been used in the Senate where what we do is to bring these pieces of legislation which are important to our States, which are important to our Nation, through a unanimous consent procedure is the way we ought to go. Unfortunately, because of objections from a few Senators on the other side, we were not able to follow that procedure. But, at the end of the day, through the great leadership of both Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici,  we were able to get that legislation through. To both of them I say thank you very much for your leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank the staff of the Energy Committee. Bob Simon, David Brooks, all of the staff on both sides who labored very hard on the more than 60 pieces of substantive legislation that we approved here this afternoon that will now head to the President's desk for his signature. So I thank them for their great efforts with respect to this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to speak briefly about four of the bills that were included in this legislation which are important to my State of Colorado and are important to the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first of those pieces of legislation has to do with the South Platte River and the North Platte River and a multistate compact that involves the State of Colorado and the State of Nebraska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, we have had issues between our States, Nebraska and Colorado, and the State of Wyoming as well, with respect to how we deal with the implementation of the Endangered Species Act and how we recover endangered species on the Platte River, mostly working in the State of Nebraska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After many years of negotiation and involvement by the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of the Interior, the States came together and developed a recovery implementation program. That is a program which is intended to restore the habitat for the whooping crane in the State of Nebraska, with the participatory effort and obligation on the part of the State of Colorado and the State of Wyoming and the State of Nebraska to recover the whooping crane and to recover habitat and hopefully  someday to be able to take that threatened and endangered species off of the list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order for us to make progress to get there, we needed to implement this tristate agreement with the Federal Government. The legislation we passed today will help us get there, and I very much appreciate the participation of Senator Hagel and Senator Nelson from Nebraska, as well as Senator Allard, Senator Barrasso, and Senator Enzi from Wyoming on this bipartisan legislation, legislation that is very important to our States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second legislative item I want to refer to here briefly is <bill type="s" number="1116">S. 1116</bill>, which is the Produced Water bill. This is legislation which was sponsored in the House of Representatives by Congressman MARK UDALL. We pushed it through our Energy Committee because we know this is happening out there in many of our public and private lands across the West; that is, as oil and gas is being developed, there is a huge amount of water that is simply being wasted, that is being disposed of without any  kind of beneficial use. For those of us who come from the arid West, who know what it is like to live in places where you only get a few inches of rainfall a year, it is important that we not waste any water whatsoever. So what this legislation will do is it will help us figure out a strategy and a plan forward on how we develop a beneficial use for the water that is being produced from oil and gas production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next bill that was included in this package which I wanted to speak about briefly is the Latino Museum bill. That legislation had several dozen cosponsors here in the Senate, including Senator Menendez, Senator Martinez, and many others who worked on that legislation over the last several years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that when we look at this legislative piece, we understand the contribution many Americans have made to this country over a long period of time. The Latino community has been here in the United States of America for a very long time. Indeed, as the case with my family, my family helped found the city of Santa Fe, NM, in 1598, now some 410 years ago. That was before Jamestown, before Plymouth Rock. You find the stories of our history across the landscape of this country from Florida,  throughout the Southwest of the United States of America. And in my own native valley, you can look out from the 8,000-foot elevation of the San Luis Valley to the mountains on the east side of the valley that are named the Sangre de Christo Mountains; that is, the "Blood of Christ Mountains." You can look to the west to another set of 14,000-foot peaks named after St. John the Baptist, the San Juan mountain range.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout America, you see the history of the Latino community etched into the landscape of our country. But it is more than that history that started out now more than four centuries ago here in the Nation, it is also the contributions Hispanics have made to this country as we have evolved from one generation to the next.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was a group of Hispanic solders who in many ways helped create this Nation through their service in George Washington's Army. It was a huge  number of American soldiers who have served in every single war since the beginning of our Republic, including people like those in my family who served, and some who died, in some of the wars we have fought in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In World War II, my father was a staff sergeant in the Army. My mother, at the age of 19, found her way across the country from a place with no post office and no name in northern New Mexico to the War Department here in Washington, DC, where she spent 5 years contributing to that great cause of the last century which made America the power and the hope and beacon of opportunity for the entire world. There have been thousands and thousands of Americans like that who have made the ultimate sacrifice.  But my mother was actually here in Washington, DC during World War II. She received a telegram that said her oldest brother, my Uncle Leandro, had been killed in the war in Europe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we authorize a study of the Latino museum in Washington, we are saying that part of our history is to recognize that diversity that makes us a great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oftentimes I reflect on the greatness we have here in America. It is important for us to reflect on the fact that that greatness has come about through some pain but always with some promise of the future. Yes, there have been painful chapters of our history, including the very painful chapter where this country allowed for one group of people to own another group of people, simply based on the color of their skin. We lived through another 100 years after the Civil War until Brown v. Board of  Education in 1954, when we allowed as a function of government for there to be the separation of the races so that it was OK for there to be Black schools and Brown schools and White schools. It took Justice Warren and a unanimous Supreme Court in 1954 to say that under the 14th amendment, that kind of segregation had no room under the equal protection clause of our Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we push forward initiatives as we have today with the Latino initiative, what we are saying to America is, we are a great nation, because we are a diverse people. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said it best in a case she decided in the last few years involving diversity at the University of Michigan. She said the national security of our country depended on the military forces having diversity. She said that in an opinion that had been filed as an amicus brief by former members of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff. She also said that the strength of the Nation in terms of future participation of the United States in the global economy was very dependent on us being able to participate in that global economy, that diversity was required for us to succeed. For that proposition, she cited to a brief filed by some 50 of the Fortune 500 companies that participated in that case. The Latino museum for us is another step in the celebration of our diversity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I look at the challenges we face ahead in this century, I think we can embrace and celebrate the diversity of our country that will make us stronger. There will be those who will say we ought to take another road and that that road ought to be the one where we allow differences to separate us, where they will agitate for using those differences among us to create discord and to bring about agents of division. I reject that view. The view I embrace is that the diversity of our country is what  will make us strong, not only in the 21st century but beyond. The Latino museum legislation we passed today is one step in making that statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also finally want to comment on <bill type="s" number="327">S. 327</bill> which was also included in this legislation. It requires a study on ways in which we can celebrate and commemorate the contributions that C&#xE9;sar Ch&#xE1;vez made to the United States. C&#xE9;sar Ch&#xE1;vez was the leader of the United Farm Workers until his death a few years ago, one of the most celebrated Americans we know today and one of the architects of our civil rights movement and someone who in many ways is typified with people who have been  pioneers of civil rights such as Martin Luther King, Jr., and others who have done so much to make sure we are an America in progress. It is fitting and proper that we, as a Congress, honor someone with the legacy of C&#xE9;sar Ch&#xE1;vez. I was proud to have bipartisan sponsorship of that legislation so that we can now move forward to figure out ways in which we can celebrate the legacy of this great man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
