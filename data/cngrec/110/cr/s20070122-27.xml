    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize MSG Larry Perry of Bruce, SD, who was recently awarded the Purple Heart Medal at Camp Clark in Afghanistan for injuries he incurred while on patrol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Master Sergeant Perry is married and has two sons. He has served with the National Guard for more than 18 years. He is a member of the 147th Field Artillery Brigade of the South Dakota Army National Guard and is currently the 203rd Regional Corps Assistance Group, RCAG, 1st Brigade Motor Officer. Master Sergeant Perry's service in Afghanistan is part of the efforts to train and mentor members of the newly organized Afghan National Army. The brigade trains Afghani soldiers in areas such as intelligence,  communications, logistics, maintenance, military operations, and leadership skills. These necessary skills are allowing the Afghan National Army to operate independently as a professional force to curb terrorist attacks, provide safety and security for its citizens, and participate as an important ally in the war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the morning of September 25, 2006, Master Sergeant Perry was serving as a gunner in the turret of a Humvee in Khowst Province when a suicide car bomb exploded alongside his convoy. The explosion sent shrapnel into his shoulder, and he suffered burns to his face and neck.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Master Sergeant Perry and his fellow soldiers face such dangers every day, and their willingness to put themselves in harm's way for the American and Afghani people is truly humbling. I, along with the citizens of South Dakota and the entire United States, owe Master Sergeant Perry a debt of gratitude that we will never be able to repay. We honor Master Sergeant Perry for his patriotism, bravery, and selflessness, and we applaud his courage in the face of danger.</paragraph>
