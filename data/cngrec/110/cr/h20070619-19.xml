    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, President Bush has been very clear. If Congress sends him appropriations bills that weaken current pro-life provisions, he will veto the bills. But don't be surprised if the new Democratic majority is trying to do so anyway. When they do, I am sure they will have countless reasons for why they should weaken protections for the unborn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as this debate goes forward, it's important to keep in mind how much Uncle Sam already gives to abortion providers. Planned Parenthood reported record profits in 2005-2006 fiscal year. Guess who helped them achieve these profits? That's right, the American taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005-2006, Planned Parenthood received over $305 million in taxpayer funding, the most ever in a year. They also performed nearly 265,000 abortions, another record. Keep this in mind as we hear the other side's arguments for giving even more money to abortion providers. The fact is, these groups are milking the American taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush is right to stand up for current pro-life provisions, and House Republicans will stand with him on the issue.</paragraph>
