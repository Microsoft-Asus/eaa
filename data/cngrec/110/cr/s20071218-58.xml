    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the Valdosta State University Blazers football team for winning the 2007 NCAA Division II National Championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Blazers celebrated their second national championship in 4 years on December 15, 2007, in Florence, AL, and completed their season with a final record of 13 to 1. Valdosta State's playoff run included victories over Catawba University, University of North Alabama, and the University of California-Pennsylvania en route to defeating Northwest Missouri State 25 to 20 in the championship game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am extremely proud of these talented men for all of their hard work and dedication that contributed to this victory. I congratulate all of the team members, particularly the senior class. Their leadership and talents will surely be missed. In addition, sophomore wide receiver Cedric Jones and junior safety Sherard Reynolds were both named First-Team All-Americans. The Blazers also had seven players named to the Gulf South Conference All-Conference Team, including Cedric Jones, Gerald Davis,  William Montford, Sherard Reynolds, Maurice Leggett, Michael Terry, and Travis Harrison. Furthermore, I would like to extend my appreciation to all the families and fans for their continual support of the Blazers throughout the season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The success of the team could not have been achieved without the exceptional coaching staff, led by head coach David Dean. Coach Dean is in his first season as head coach of the Blazers, having been the team's offensive coordinator for the past 7 years. He is only the second first-year coach in history to lead his team to a Division II title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Valdosta, a city long known for its tradition in high school football, can now boast about the success of Valdosta State University, which has won 2 Division II National Championships in 4 years. It is my hope that the winning tradition at Valdosta State will continue for many years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations again to all of these young men and to all associated with the Valdosta State Blazers football program for their great accomplishments and hard work.</paragraph>
