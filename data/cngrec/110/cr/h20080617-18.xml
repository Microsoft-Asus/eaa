    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as cochair of the Bulgaria Caucus, I rise today to welcome Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev of the Republic of Bulgaria to Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the defeat of communism in Eastern Europe, Bulgaria has emerged as a dynamic democracy. The country became a part of NATO in 2004 and the European Union in 2007. Recently the World Bank classified Bulgaria as one of the top 10 nations to have undertaken important economic reforms to attract business investment. Bulgaria is the only EU nation to be listed in the top 10.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since my first visit as an election observer in June 1990, I have seen firsthand the talented people of Bulgaria emerge from totalitarianism to be one of the world's most vibrant nations as a free market democracy. Elena Poptodorova, the able ambassador from Bulgaria, has been vital in developing Bulgarian-American friendships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I especially wish to thank Bulgaria for their continued support in the global war on terrorism. I have visited Bulgarian troops in Afghanistan, and my son Alan served with Bulgarians in Iraq. Our Nation and the world is safer and more prosperous by defeating terrorism overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
