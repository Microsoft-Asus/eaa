  <narrative>DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY SAYS "NOT GUILTY" -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10907]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, with O.J. Simpson back in the news, House leadership has decided to take one of his famous lines and use it to escape responsibility for a multitude of massive, budget-busting spending bills that they are trying to pass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Raising taxes nationwide by $400 billion, including an on-average $3,000 per tax increase per American citizen? The Democrat majority says, "not guilty."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Withholding the passage of veterans health care bills for political purposes? The majority again says, "not guilty."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Granting illegal immigrants health care benefits and taking Medicare Advantage benefits away from our seniors and putting them in waiting lines for wheelchairs? The House leadership pleads "not guilty."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, sorry majority party. The American people are tired of your wasteful spending, and they will not acquit. This Congress needs to instill fiscal discipline and balance the budget so our families can build a better, brighter future.</paragraph>
