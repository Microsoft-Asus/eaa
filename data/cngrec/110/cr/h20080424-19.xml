    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>, the Coast Guard Authorization Act that includes critical provisions to strengthen the U.S. Coast Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's been since 2004, the last time we actually moved through House and Senate and conference a Coast Guard authorization bill, not for lack of effort. In the 109th Congress in 2005 and 2006 the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, under then Chairman Don Young, a strong advocate, admirer of and one who embraces the U.S. Coast Guard, we moved the bill through committee, and we brought it to the House in 2006. Unfortunately, we were not able to reach conference with the other  body, but not for lack of effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so that bipartisan initiative was rekindled last year as the committee picked up the pieces and incorporated the work of previous Congresses and moved forward with a very expansive Coast Guard authorization bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Toward that purpose, I express my deepest appreciation for the chairmanship of the subcommittee, under Elijah Cummings, the Member from Baltimore, who has embraced his responsibility and duty and embraced the Coast Guard and mastered the subject matter. And our ranking member on that Coast Guard Subcommittee, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette) who, in his ever thoughtful, judicious, thorough manner, similarly has mastered the subject matter. He is a master of detail, and  has brought many thoughtful recommendations to the legislation that is before us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I thank the gentleman for his splendid cooperation, that of the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Mica, who has ceded the floor responsibilities to Mr. LaTourette. Mr. Mica, representing the State of Florida, a State that is intimately related with, to, dependent upon, and grateful to the Coast Guard for its services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this bill, we extend, we first of all, increase personnel for the U.S. Coast Guard. In my first year in Congress, 1975, I served on the Coast Guard Subcommittee and subsequently, all through to 1995, when the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, which included Coast Guard, was dissolved and the responsibilities of the Coast Guard transferred over to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure where I continued to work on Coast Guard issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1975, Coast Guard personnel authorization was at 39,000. We added 27 new functions, new responsibilities, various Congresses, various presidents over the years, without increasing substantially Coast Guard personnel. We do that in this legislation. We add 1,500 military personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We increase the total strength of the Coast Guard to 47,000 to adequately serve the needs of the clear dual responsibilities of the Coast Guard, safety, which is search and rescue, and buoy tending and navigation aids and so on, and the security responsibility in the Coast Guard in the era of homeland security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be no argument or no, how shall I say, excuse in the future that the Coast Guard doesn't have sufficient personnel so they have to be a multi-mission agency. We're going to assure that they have adequate personnel through this authorization and subsequent funding of it to carry out all of their civil responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We extend benefits to Coast Guard personnel, reimburse them for medical-related travel for members assigned to remote locations. We grant access to Armed Forces retirement home systems to the Coast Guard veterans. We allow Coast Guard in this legislation to provide authorization for personnel who work in support of a declaration of a major disaster or emergency issued by the President to retain up to a total of 90 days of accrued leave compared to only 60 days currently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We implement the administration's proposal initiated by the Coast Guard to reorganize the Coast Guard. As they propose in their plan in this legislation, we provide authorization that eliminates two area commands established by law and the Coast Guard chief of staff position and replace those with four vice admirals, deputy commandant for mission support, deputy commandant for national operations and policy, the commander for force readiness command and the commander for the operations command,  and we promote, in this legislation, the vice commandant to full admiral.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation strengthens substantially fishing vessel safety, the most dangerous occupation in the United States, improving the training, construction, and enforcement standards for commercial fishing vessels; double hull around fuel bunker tanks on new construction of U.S. vessels. Any vessel carrying more than 600 cubic meters of oil will have double hulls around their fuel tanks to prevent the disastrous consequences such as the COSCO BUSAN, which Chairman Cummings went out to  hold a hearing on in the San Francisco Bay following the allision with the Bay Bridge and with the release of 53,000 gallons of heavy fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ballast water treatment. We have the first enforcement program since invasive species were identified as a major problem in the Great Lakes in the 1970s. We require ships to install ballast water treatment systems in 2009 to control invasive species into U.S. ports, waterways, of course in the inland waterways and the Great Lakes. We established a standard adopted by the International Maritime Organization from 2009 to 2012, but beginning in 2012, the standard will be increased to 100 times greater  than the IMO, based on best-available technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are eight provisions dealing with port security that I will withhold comment on which Chairman BENNIE THOMPSON will speak, and I'm very grateful for his participation in all of our committee work. I will also set aside for the moment the Coast Guard Deepwater assets procurement issue for Chairman Cummings to address. That was a matter on which he devoted an enormous amount of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We remove appearance of conflict by transferring administrative law judges from the Coast Guard to the National Transportation Safety Board, as we did years ago, bipartisan initiative in our committee for pilots. The venue for appeals to the commandant decision to suspend or revoke a mariner's license, such as a captain's license, for violation of marine safety laws or acts of professional incompetence will now be heard by an NTSB administrative law judge but retaining the Coast Guard authority  to decide whether to seek suspension or revocation of a mariner's license.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2007, two former Coast Guard ALJs testified before the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation that they were pressured not to allow a mariner's discovery of information that could vindicate that mariner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think one of our major contributions, perhaps in my mind the most significant, apart from the Deepwater, which has already passed the House, is the establishment of new Marine Safety Authority and raising the quality of personnel and the authority for marine safety within the Coast Guard, establish marine safety as a function of the Coast Guard. It is now mentioned in their basic law. But we established marine safety as a Coast Guard function focused on actions necessary to protect life, property  and the environment at sea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Created an assistant commandant for marine safety. The chief of marine safety in each Coast Guard sector; established minimum qualifications for all marine safety personnel saying that those persons appointed to marine safety positions, safety inspectors, casualty inspectors, chief of marine safety, be technically qualified for those positions that they should have at least the qualifications that the American Bureau of Shipping has and better than those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We establish a limited duty officer program in marine safety to allow commanders or chief warrant officers who have extensive marine safety experience to have the opportunity to specialize in marine safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We require that appeals and waivers of marine safety laws and regulations be handled by qualified marine inspectors. Those marine safety regulations now are handled by the chain of command of the Coast Guard. That means an appeal can be decided by a ship driver, a helicopter pilot, who has no qualifications in the specific issue at hand. We need to raise the qualifications, the skills of those personnel in key positions of the Coast Guard. This bill does that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we also require establishment of and funding for a course in marine safety as part of the curriculum at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. I was there in New London at the Coast Guard Academy on Friday, and a commandant of the academy and a commandant of cadets both were thrilled with this idea, as were cadets with whom I visited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the final point I want to call attention to is the strengthening of the marine pollution prevention provisions in the act. I will leave those details to later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, at this time it's my privilege to yield such time as he may consume to the ranking member of the full committee, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400273" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank our ranking member, Mr. LaTourette, for yielding time to me, and I am pleased to speak on an important reauthorization measure, and that's reauthorization of our Coast Guard. Unfortunately, I'm told that even if we pass this bill today, and it will not be passed in totality, it still must be conferenced with the other body, that this authorization is only good through the end of this fiscal year. And, unfortunately, this reauthorization has  been delayed, and we will find ourselves back at the beginning gate, starting gate, so to speak. That's one of my disappointments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, though, before I get into my disappointments, let me commend, first of all, our ranking member, Mr. LaTourette. He's worked tirelessly as the Republican leader of the Coast Guard Subcommittee to try to bring this reauthorization legislation together. He's taken some absolutely terrible proposals that first came out and made them much, much better, and I commend Mr. LaTourette for his hard work on this and trying to reach compromise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also compliment Mr. Oberstar, my counterpart in the committee, heads up the Democrat side, our chairman, for his efforts to try to bring about bipartisan compromise on the legislation. Mr. Cummings, the chairman of the Coast Guard Subcommittee, has worked with our ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I thank all of them. Their efforts have been good, and I'm going to cast a vote in favor of this to move the process forward, and I think that's incumbent in my particular position to try to continue to make the bill better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good reauthorization start. I do have two major concerns that I want to say that I am not pleased with, the administration is not pleased with, and I think the United States Coast Guard is not pleased with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, I have opposition to two provisions. Let me speak about the first one, and one you heard a lot about, the safety regime that's created in this bill. Unfortunately, this particular provision, while it may sound good that the safety is being addressed, it really destroys the command and control function that is so essential in a national security agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the Coast Guard's primary responsibility is one of national security. It's also safety, but it is first and foremost, a national security agency. And this regime sets up an unprecedented bureaucracy. It also destroys the command approach that we have had in our services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, it would prescribe the duties, qualifications, and set up a chain of command of senior Coast Guard officials. This represents an extraordinary intrusion upon the service chiefs' authority to command and control a branch of the Armed Forces and, ultimately, the ability of the Secretary and the President to deploy the Coast Guard in an emergency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now this isn't just my evaluation. This is the Coast Guard, this is the administration, the President's evaluation of what the current language would do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately again, we still have this provision that needs to be worked on, and we need to make certain that national security, the ability to command and control a branch of the armed services is not damaged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second reason that I have concern about this legislation is that unfortunately, the waterside security provisions here that relate to liquefied natural gas terminals and liquefied natural gas tankers requires the Coast Guard to provide security in a manner that is contrary to the existing assistance framework and also at odds with assisted risk-management practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In simple layman's terms, what's happening is right now when we're having a difficulty of getting a supply of natural gas, and gas prices are soaring. People are seeing natural gas prices reach record levels. We're creating more redtape, more impediments and setting up another regime in which we will limit the supply and also actually create more impediments to getting the supply so the cost can go down and the people who have access to probably one of the best sources of energy has the least  amount of damage of any of the fossil fuels to our environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So those are my two concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, again, I'm going to support the measure. I'm hoping that through conference, we can make the bill much better, that we can address the command regime that's set up here in a new safety bureaucracy, that we can also make certain that we have a supply of liquefied natural gas, access to liquefied natural gas and also bring the prices down for the consumer who's under incredible pressure right now trying to pay bills, meet the costs of increasing energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So those are my concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to thank all of the members who've worked on this in the committee, the ranking member Mr. LaTourette, Mr. Oberstar, and Mr. Cummings for their efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes, first to express my great appreciation for John Cullather, Chief of Staff on the Coast Guard Subcommittee on the Democratic side, Richard Hiscock, Lucinda Lessley, Ianta Summers, Christy Rutherford, and on the Republican staff, John Rayfield and Eric Nagel, with whom we have worked diligently and consistently and thoroughly and achieved a great accommodation of use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, I don't share the ranking Republican member's pessimistic outlook for this legislation. The Coast Guard reauthorization has been reported from committee in the other body. It has been hotlined by the Democratic leadership in the other body. They anticipate it will clear those hotline processes shortly and that the other body will be able to, in due course, in relatively short period of time, consider a Coast Guard bill on the floor, and that we can, in fact, anticipate conference with  the other body by and before the beginning of summer. I have a very positive and hopeful outlook.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, as for redesigning and restructuring the Coast Guard, the committee has done that since the 1960s, directing how the structure of the Coast Guard shall be organized. In fact, we do far less structuring in this bill following in that tradition than is done for the U.S. Navy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland, Chair of the subcommittee, Mr. Cummings.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400090" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I want to thank the chairman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, I rise today in strong support of the amendment in the nature of a substitute to <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>, the Coast Guard Authorization Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for his inspired leadership of the Transportation Committee. I also thank Chairman Thompson for his leadership on the Homeland Security Committee. Further, I thank my ranking member of the Transportation Committee, Mr. Mica. And I give special thanks to Congressman LaTourette for his service as the ranking member of the Coast Guard Subcommittee. And certainly I thank Congressman King.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the 110th Congress, I've led the subcommittee in examining the many ways in which the Coast Guard, our thin blue line at sea, has been stretched since 9/11. The amendment in the nature of a substitute before us today responds directly to the issues we have examined by ensuring that the Coast Guard has the expertise and resources necessary to perform all of its missions effectively and efficiently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation would authorize $8.4 billion for the Coast Guard and authorize an increase in the total number of military personnel to 47,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our subcommittee has become deeply concerned that the area where the Coast Guard is becoming thinnest is in marine safety, the function responsible for protecting lives, property and the environment at sea. The declines in this program have become shockingly evident when the Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General found that the Coast Guard dispatched three individuals who were not qualified to conduct an investigation to respond to the ship that hit the San Francisco Bay Bridge and  subsequently spilled 54,000 gallons of fuel into the Bay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without taking away any of the resources or the flexibility that the Coast Guard needs to perform any other mission, including securing our ports, the amendment in the nature of a substitute requires that individuals  who ensure the safety of the maritime industry prepare for these highly technical jobs by meeting requisite training standards. The bill also requires that as new liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals are approved, all of the resources necessary  to adequately secure these terminals are in place. I emphasize that these provisions will not impede the development of any new project. They will simply ensure that security requirements are met before new terminals become operational.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill> will set new and increasingly stringent standards for the treatment of ballast water through which invasive species have been introduced to some of our Nation's most fragile marine environments, such as the Chesapeake Bay. It will also give mariners the right to have cases involving the potential suspension or revocation of their professional credentials heard by the National Transportation Safety Board's administrative law judge system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These provisions respond to compelling testimony from former Coast Guard ALJs indicating that they did not work in an environment that supported their exercise of judicial independence. Mariners who are unsafe should not be on our Nation's waterways, but fair treatment must be assured to all individuals in any legal proceeding. And the transfer of the Coast Guard's ALJ function to the National Transportation Safety Board will avoid even the potential appearance of unfairness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the amendment takes significant new steps to ensure that our Nation's "shield of freedom" resembles the nation it is defending. The bill would require applicants to the Coast Guard Academy to be nominated by Members of Congress or other authorities. This, in conjunction with expanded minority recruiting efforts, would draw students from all of our Nation's communities to the academy, beginning the process that the Commandant himself has said is needed to expand minorities at all ranks  of the more than 6,000-member officer corps from the current number of 827.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, it is my honor to be an original cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>, which will set standards that will ensure the Coast Guard performs at the level it expects of itself while also providing the resources necessary to enable the service to fulfill all of its missions.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400235" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2830">H.R. 2830</bill>, and I'll tell you why in just a second, but just a couple of editorial notes. One is that it is my belief that this Coast Guard reauthorization is brought to the floor in the best traditions of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. And I want to commend the ranking member of our full committee, Mr. Mica, for his diligence and work, and also for expressing his remaining concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to express my appreciation to the chairman of our subcommittee, Mr. Cummings, who I've had the pleasure now of working with about a year and a half, and I will tell you there is no Member that is more dedicated to not only the mission of the Coast Guard, but the safety of those that they entrust with supervising. It is a pleasure to serve in the post of ranking member with Mr. Cummings as the chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, also, a special affection for the chairman of the full committee. I made the observation at the beginning of this Congress, and I'll repeat it again today, that obviously, as a Republican, none of us were excited about being thrust after 12 years from the majority party to the minority party, but if there was to be a Democratic Chair of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, there is no one more deserving, in my opinion, perhaps in the history of the institution, than the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar). He really takes our committee, no matter what the issue, above partisanship to the goals of the Transportation Committee, and that is, safeguarding our waterways and building America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, lastly, while I'm saying nice things about people, I am pleased, Mr. Chairman, that the Speaker of the House, Mrs. Pelosi, has installed you as the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole for the consideration of this piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of this bill. And I am especially proud of the ballast water provisions and the marine safety provisions located within the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will establish national standards requiring the treatment of ballast water to minimize the introduction of invasive species into the Great Lakes and other U.S. waters. The bill will build on a lot of work that has already been done. Those of us that are from the Great Lakes know very well the importance of this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am disappointed that we'll have a colloquy later with the chairman of the full committee relative to an amendment that was offered at the Rules Committee that would protect millions of recreational boaters from falling under a discharge permitting program designed for large oceangoing vessels. In the absence of this language, come September recreational voters will be facing fines of up to $32,500 a day for violations of program rules. For more than 30 years, Mr. Chairman, both recreational  and commercial vehicles were exempted from these programs, and I hope that the majority will join us to develop language addressing these understandings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As well, when we get to the amendment portion of the bill, I have an amendment that I'm offering with Mr. Boustany of Louisiana that addresses some of the concerns raised by the ranking member, Mr. Mica, relative to waterside security for liquefied natural gas facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to thank the Chair of the subcommittee and the full committee for working with us. I want to thank Mr. Boustany for his dogged work to make sure that we come up with a resolution that not only fits with the reality of assets that are available, builds on a long tradition that we established in 2005, but also permits us to move forward with the goal of attaining cheaper energy for Americans through the form of natural gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Chairman, I thank the Chair very much and would reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Committee will rise informally.</chair>
  <chair>The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Tauscher) assumed the chair.</chair>
