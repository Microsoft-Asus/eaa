  <speaking speaker="412213" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this week, news reports came out indicating our Federal budget deficit has continued to drop and our economy continues to grow due to tax relief policies passed by Congress in 2001 and 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In spite of that good news, Democratic leadership in Congress is discounting advancements made possible by this tax relief by trying to slap U.S. taxpayers with a $400 billion tax increase that will slow our economy and its current progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, Democrats piled $6 billion in new spending onto January's omnibus budget bill to finish the 2007 appropriations process, passed a budget for 2008 that is $20 billion more than the President's budget request, and added billions in extra spending to the few appropriations bills the House has passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Raising taxes hurts American families, discourages innovation and hinders job creation. Let's work together in this Congress to make tax relief permanent and continue to grow our economy. Together, this Congress can foster further prosperity and build a better, brighter future for our country.</paragraph>
