    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor Bossier City, LA, which is celebrating its centennial anniversary, and I would like to take a few moments to publicly recognize their great history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1830s, the area of Bossier City originally encompassed the Elysian Groves Plantation of James Crane. Due to its proximity to the river, it quickly became a hotbed for trade and activity. By 1850, hundreds of wagons crossed through the vicinity on their way to the West; many settlers also stayed, realizing the land's fertile river valley and abundant farmland. Soon, interstate railway systems boomed, and Bossier became a growing metropolis. The farmers, realizing the area's potential, quickly  began to sell plots of land as transportation flourished. Finally, in 1907, with its growing textile industry and expansive transportation system, Bossier City received official status as a city in Louisiana. Throughout its history, Bossier City has endured and survived many impediments, such as the great fire which consumed over half of the downtown area. In the late 1950s, Bossier was named the fastest growing city in Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bossier City began its centennial celebration on April 7 with the biggest birthday party that the city has ever witnessed on the banks of the city's foundation on the Red River. The initial festivities ranged from the opportunity to meet the city's oldest resident to a reception, with a 100-square-foot birthday cake. Throughout the year, the commemoration will continue with events from the American Cancer Society's Relay for Life to Barksdale Air Force Base. Over the year, residents and business  owners in the city will be able to attend and plan activities that aid in representing the city's deep southern history and culture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The centennial memorializes Bossier City's rise to one of the great cities of the State of Louisiana. Today, I want to congratulate Bossier City on the last 100 years, and I wish the residents luck and continued success and progress.</paragraph>
