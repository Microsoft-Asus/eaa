    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 719 provides for consideration of <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act of 2007 under the traditional closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except for clause 9 and 10 of rule XXI. Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today, <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>, implements several measures to protect the interest of taxpayers and the integrity of our tax system. First, it would once and for all repeal the IRS's authority to contract with private debt collection companies. The collection of Federal income taxes is inherently a governmental function and at the crux of what governmental responsibilities should be. This was stated as early as 1819 by Chief Justice Marshall. It was reaffirmed by Congress in  1874, when the Ways and Means Committee said that "any system of farming the collection of any portion of the revenue of the government is fundamentally wrong."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tax farming, giving a private entity the right to collect taxes on a commission basis, has created modern-day bounty hunters who have no regard for the taxpayer, only regard for their company's bottom line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Taxpayers are heavily pressured to reveal their Social Security numbers, last known address, date of birth, and other confidential information over the telephone to private contractors working on commissions of up to 25 percent of their take.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this modern day and age where identity theft runs rampant, why would we want to turn over people's Social Security numbers and who knows what other confidential information to someone who is only out to protect their own bottom line? Noted Princeton economist Paul Krugman recently penned in the New York Times, "Tax farming went out with the French Revolution; now the tax farmers are back." How right he is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The irony is that we tried this private tax collection scheme in 1996 and promptly abandoned it. Why? Because the IRS's Inspector General found that private contractors regularly violated our own Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, threatened the confidentiality of taxpayers' personal information, and on top of all that, cost the government a net revenue loss of $17 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite this past history, the Republican Congress renewed this authority in 2004. What has happened since that renewal? Well, the Federal Government has spent an additional $71 million of taxpayers' hard-earned money and they have collected a grand total of $20 million in tax revenue. That is right, Mr. Speaker; we have lost another $50 million on an inefficient program that experts readily admit does not work. Even more absurd is that had the IRS been given that money, the $71 million, instead,  it would have collected almost $1.5 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House has long recognized that this program simply does not work. In fact, language to stop private debt collection has passed on a strong bipartisan basis twice but has not made it into law. But don't just take my word for it. The National Taxpayer Advocate, appointed by the Treasury Secretary, reported to Congress that "the money spent on the IRS Private Debt Collection initiative is an inefficient use of government dollars." Even past and present IRS Commissioners have repeatedly admitted  before Congress that IRS employees could perform this task at far less cost than the private agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I firmly believe that when the government actually does something better than the private sector, cheaper and more efficiently than the private sector, then the government should do that job. The reality, Mr. Speaker, is that IRS employees are better trained, better equipped and better prepared to handle these important responsibilities. They also protect American citizens' privacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill> recognizes this reality and restores this fundamental responsibility to the Federal Government, as our Founding Fathers intended. Second, <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill> includes language based on legislation introduced by my friend and colleague from Florida (Mr. Meek), which provides tax relief to small businesses and administrative relief to local jurisdictions by delaying implementation of an onerous tax burden.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 511 of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005, passed by the then-Republican Congress to raise revenue, requires tax withholding of 3 percent on payments to vendors providing property or services to the government beginning in January of 2011. The 3 percent withholding requirement presents a number of administrative and practical challenges for businesses, including reducing the cash flow they need to meet operating expenses, pay suppliers or subcontractors, or meet  payroll. They also present several problems for governments, including how State and local governments will be able to comply with this law, much less how the IRS will be able to afford and administer such a requirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill> takes a commonsense approach to this issue and delays the implementation of the 3 percent withholding requirement for 1 year. It further calls on the Department of the Treasury to study the compliance issues confronting businesses and government and report the findings to Congress. This measure is supported by State and local governments and a broad array of business organizations, including the United States Chamber of Commerce, the Financial Services Roundtable, the American Bankers  Association, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Federation of Independent Business, among others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill> also clarifies that U.S. citizens who claim to be bona fide residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands receive the same procedural and administrative rights afforded to other U.S. taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill> strictly adheres to the House PAYGO rule. This bill is paid for primarily by eliminating a tax loophole that currently allows wealthy individuals to avoid paying U.S. taxes simply by renouncing their citizenship or terminating their U.S. residency. Despite what you may hear today, let me be clear, closing this loophole has broad, bipartisan support and has been supported by my Republican colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Chairman Rangel, Mr. Van Hollen, Mr. Meek, and the Ways and Means Committee members for their hard work in bringing this legislation to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this commonsense bill protects taxpayers, preserves the integrity of our tax system, and makes our tax system fairer for all. It deserves strong support of all the Members of this House floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400367" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am not sure that there is anything even left to say about the depths to which the House has sunk under the "broken promise" Democrat majority. Today, once again, the American people are being forced to endure the results of yet another evening spent in the "broken promise" Democrat Rules Committee, with nothing to show for it except for yet another closed rule, which was referred to today as a "traditionally closed rule" on the floor of the United States House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this completely closed rule, which denies the minority even with a basic substitute amendment in this process, and to the fiscally irresponsible underlying legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also rise with great regret to report to the American people that, once again, as I have been forced to report on multiple occasions over the course of this year, the Democrat leadership is bringing legislation to the House floor which stacks the deck in favor of big labor bosses at someone else's expense. Today, that expense is on the American taxpayer, who is being targeted on behalf of big public sector union bosses to the tune of $2.2 billion, to be exact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take a few minutes to discuss a number of the myths that will be discussed surrounding this legislation and provide my colleagues and the American people who are tuning in  on C-SPAN with some of the facts about the real effect of this special interest legislation and what it would mean to the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, Congress gave the IRS the ability to utilize the best practices and advantages created by the private sector to address its growing backlog of unpaid debt. Today, it is estimated that $345 billion of these unpaid taxes exist. That means that every year the average taxpayer who plays by the rules must pay an extra $2,700 to cover taxes not being paid by those who should legally be paying their taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new program, which began as a small pilot program that grows as it continues to succeed, is estimated to bring in about $2.2 billion in its first 10 years. And under this agreement, the IRS would get the first 25 cents of every single new dollar to hire new collections professionals, a provision that would have a positive, compound effect by helping to bring in even greater amounts of this uncollected revenue for the government into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The program, even in its beginning stages and despite numerous attempts by the Democrat majority to kill it before it could succeed, has been hugely successful, bringing in over $30 million worth of unpaid taxes. It has received a 98 percent rating from the IRS for regulatory and procurement accuracy, as well a 100 percent rating for professionalism. Additionally, less than 1 percent of the taxpayers contacted by these private agencies have filed complaints with the IRS, none which have ever  been validated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite this program's track record of success on behalf of taxpayers who do play by the rules and pay their designated share, not to mention the increased revenue that it brings in to fund the Democrats' other new, big-spending legislation, there are many opponents on the other side of the aisle that want to prevent it from continuing to work, supposedly to protect the dues of the big government union bosses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have claimed, despite the fact that 40 out of the 50 States in America already use these same contract services, that this is something that only the government can do. You don't have to take my word for it that this is untrue. Even the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has found that "the IRS may benefit from using private collectors, and it is reasonable to assume that the IRS could learn from their best practices as it works to resolve long-standing problems with  its debt collection activities."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opponents have also incorrectly claimed that private debt collectors do not follow the same rules as IRS collectors. Well, this one is partially true, because these private collection agencies are subject to both Federal and State laws that are collectively more restrictive than the laws that Federal employees must follow. Private collectors follow the same privacy protections, undergo the same background checks and are subject to the same penalties if they violate any of these laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opponents have also claimed that allowing for private debt collection would cost untold union jobs, a statement which is also based in an alternate reality. The private collection agencies working in this program did not and do not replace a single IRS worker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As of this past July, over 51,667 "cold cases" that the IRS was incapable of collecting were given to private agencies, resulting in over 5,300 full repayments to the Treasury and almost 2,000 agreements to repay these debts incrementally. This means that the government received over $24 million of gross revenue that it would not have received otherwise, of which only about one in eight went to pay for these otherwise nonexistent services. In fact, the IRS has publicly stated that no government  employee will lose his or her job as a result of this highly effective private contracting. Instead, they will benefit from the opportunity to focus their talent, expertise and resources on high priority, more complex cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to understand all of the facts regarding this legislation before they are influenced by the scare tactics of a few Members who are determined to kill this highly-effective program that has already proven to be cost-effective in closing the "tax gap" of unpaid, hard-to collect taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish I could say they would have plenty of time to learn all the facts surrounding this legislation that is being rushed to the floor today under a completely closed process. Unfortunately, last night in the "Graveyard of Good Ideas in the House of Representatives," the majority Rules Committee Democrats voted three times along party lines to prevent any amendment authored by a Republican from being considered today. Despite numerous campaign promises by the highest ranking Democrats in the  House to run the most "transparent, open and honest" House in history, this Democrat majority once again has provided the House with something which is a rule that is none of the above, which is the historical tradition. Instead, we have what is referred</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I oppose this ill-conceived and costly legislation, and I encourage all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up for taxpayers by voting against this rule and the underlying legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we said in our opening statement, tax bills are traditionally closed due to their complexity. Under Democrats, before 1994, they were closed. Under Mr. Dreier's administration in the House Rules Committee under the Republican leadership, they were traditionally closed. Now we continue to maintain that practice. Because tax laws are so complex, late amendments that have not been fully vetted and analyzed are simply too complex to insert into the Tax Code without knowing  their full ramifications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Sessions, my colleague from Texas, mentioned that the McCrery substitute was not made in order. He is correct about that. It was not made in order because it violates the PAYGO provisions of our House rules. I have a copy of it right here. It simply does not meet the PAYGO statutory requirements of the House rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the Republican privatization bill that had passed in a prior Congress, when it was implemented it spent $71 million to collect $20 million. That is a loss of $50 million. Even with the creative accounting of the Republican "voodoo math," I cannot believe that they are advocating continuation of this program that has lost money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, the use of private contractors to collect Federal taxes violates a confidential and fundamental relationship between American taxpayers and the Federal Government. IRS employees have access to a taxpayer's complete tax history, including personal information that is ready identifiable. That should be restricted only to IRS employees. By prohibiting the IRS from hiring private debt collectors, this bill will ensure that the privacy rights of Americans and other confidential information  of taxpayers is protected from bounty hunters working on commissions of up to 25 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400367" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we continue to hear arguments from my good friends about how this just won't work. But for 10 years it has worked very well, with a 99 percent accuracy, in providing billions of dollars to the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is that Treasury simply focuses their activities on major accounts, and the others on smaller accounts, which is who have been handling these accounts and been very good at it, which is what we are asking to continue today. What is happening is that we found out the unions simply don't like that. They don't like somebody else perhaps getting something that they in fact never wanted to work on themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are trying to say to the American people today, don't take away this stream of revenue. Don't take away this opportunity. Because the private sector is working on these accounts. They are not given any advantage. The  people who really end up winning is not only the Treasury Department, but, more specifically, the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from San Dimas, California (Mr. Dreier), the ranking member of the Rules Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. DREIER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400115" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Dallas for yielding, and I want to buttress his argument, which is a very clear one. Obviously, we want to ensure that every American pays their fair share of taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had a dramatic increase in collection success by virtue of this program, and here we are gutting it because a very small group of people seems to oppose it. It happens to be union opposition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a taxpayer, I pay my fair share of taxes. I want to make sure that every other American pays their fair share of taxes, and that is exactly what this 10-year-old program has done, and has done with success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I really am very, very puzzled as we begin today with the debate on two rules that will lead to legislation being considered here on the House floor. The reason I am perplexed is we are dealing with two very important issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority leadership clearly has its right and its responsibility to move their agenda. They want to do what they are planning to do now on this issue of private sector collection of taxes, and they want to dramatically expand housing programs. Those are the two things that the majority is planning to move to the floor today. But I just don't understand, Mr. Speaker. I just don't understand why it is that we are doing what we are doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friend from California, Mr. Cardoza, just described how the Rules Committee was run when I had the privilege of serving as chairman of the committee. He said we have what is a customary closed rule, I think is the term that he used. Is that the term? I would be happy to yield to my friend.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400065" topic="">
    <paragraph>I called it traditional.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400115" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for clarifying that. He described it as a traditional closed rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will say that it is true that on tax bills both parties recognize that the notion of completely opening up a Tax Code measure in the Ways and Means Committee is not the wisest thing to do, so neither party has done that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I will tell you this, Mr. Speaker: We, when we were in the majority, regularly ensured that the ranking minority member, Mr. Rangel, had a substitute that he could offer. In fact, on numerous occasions we offered Mr. Rangel the chance to propose a sight-unseen substitute to measures that were coming forward, and I will admit, I will admit that on occasion, but a very rare occasion, we did not provide that substitute to Mr. Rangel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will say when that happened, Mr. Rangel clearly let us know how unhappy he was that he did not have a substitute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that at the beginning of this Congress we had this document put forward by the new majority called "a New Direction for America." In this document, the item titled "Regular Order For Legislation" under "A Congress Working For All Americans," paragraph 2 reads as follows, Mr. Speaker. It says, "Bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full and fair debate, consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the rights to offer  its alternatives, including a substitute." This is the commitment that was made to the American people under "A New Direction for America."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I recognize that having a completely open rule on a measure that emerges from the Ways and Means Committee is not the wisest thing for us to do. But, Mr. Speaker, what we are doing here today on this rule is absolutely outrageous and a complete violation of this commitment that was made at the beginning of this Congress for a new era of openness, transparency and accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in fact, as I said last night in the Rules Committee, we have now almost completed the first session of the 110th Congress. Our target adjournment date is October 26, just a couple of weeks away. On not one occasion in this entire session of Congress has the distinguished ranking minority member of the Ways and Means Committee, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. McCrery), been offered the chance to propose a substitute to any measure that has emerged from the Ways and Means  Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will say, Mr. Speaker, as we regularly get criticized for when we were in the majority, we never did anything close to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I am saddened greatly by the fact that we are not only doing this on this rule, Mr. Speaker, but on the next measure that we are about to bring up. It is going to be another item that will have come from the Committee on Financial Services. It's a plan to dramatically increase housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week we had a measure that came from the Committee on Financial Services and it was a flood insurance bill. Not a terribly partisan issue, a measure that has impacted Democrats and Republicans on the gulf coast, Florida, along the eastern seaboard and other parts of our country. Democrats and Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, last week in the measure that emerged from the Committee on Financial Services, the Rules Committee had a wide range of amendments that were proposed by both Democrats and Republicans. In fact, the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services talked about a commitment that had been made to allow a number of Republican amendments to be considered, so those Members withdrew their amendments when they were debating this in the Committee on Financial Services on flood insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The day before the committee reported that out, we happened to have unveiled, as Members of the minority, our report providing an assessment of basically the first 9 months of the Pelosi Speakership and the way the Speaker's Rules Committee has been run. This report, very brief, lots of graphs in it, 10 pages long, I would commend it to my colleagues. They can get a copy by going to rules-Republicans.house.gov. I would recommend that they look at this, Mr. Speaker, and the reason is, if you compare  this performance, whether it is denying Members a chance to even submit amendments to the Rules Committee, which is something we would have never comprehended, to having double the number of closed rules as we did at this point in the 109th Congress, you will see, Mr. Speaker, that this report shows that the performance of the first session of the 110th Congress has been 180 degrees from what was promised the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So last week when we had this flood insurance measure that came forward, as I said, an agreement had been struck between the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services and a number of Republicans on that committee to have their amendments considered. And what happened? There were 13 amendments made in order, Mr. Speaker. Not one single Republican amendment was made in order. Not one single Republican amendment was made in order. This is not just a party thing; this is the American people  who are not allowed to be heard because these representatives represent people along the eastern seaboard, the gulf coast, Florida, areas impacted by floods and hurricanes. We have flooding in California and all across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what happened. The American people whose representatives had thoughtful proposals, and the chairman of the committee thought those proposals should be heard, were denied by this Rules Committee, and it just happened the day after this report which we hoped would lead the new majority to help keep the promises made in a new direction for America. And what happened? They did even worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so where do we stand today, Mr. Speaker. Well, Mr. Sessions has just pointed out what has happened in this rule. Again, not one chance in this entire Congress for the ranking minority member of the Ways and Means Committee to offer a proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in the next bill we will have before us, unfortunately, there is not a single Republican amendment made in order. Yes, there is a substitute, the Neugebauer substitute; but not one Republican amendment made in order,  and all seven of the amendments that the Democrats proposed have been made in order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I had an exchange with the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services, and while he did not support most or any of these amendments that I know of, unfortunately what happened was, when the committee chairman said we ought to consider some of these, the committee chose to completely shut out Members of the minority from having an opportunity other than the Neugebauer substitute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me say I am puzzled and I am saddened, both, as I look at this performance. When we are promised a new direction for America and greater transparency, disclosure and accountability, and generally a full and open debate, including a substitute, which is the exact wording that Speaker Pelosi had in this new direction for America, and here we are doing the exact opposite.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, on this measure itself, I hope very much we will defeat the previous question so the very thoughtful work Mr. English has done dealing with relief for the American people from the onerous burden of the alternative minimum tax can be addressed. Unfortunately, that is not allowed. But I do believe if we defeat the previous question, we can allow the American people to have a chance to have some kind of relief from the onerous alternative minimum tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me so much time, but I felt compelled to make these arguments on this bill and the next bill that will be coming forward. I hope, and I am very sincere about this, as an institutionalist, I hope and pray that we will do better for the American people when it comes to structuring and allowing full and fair and free debate on the House floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my colleague from California is a very skilled orator, and I appreciate his speaking ability. I will tell you, however, one of the great tools that people use when they are as talented as Mr. Dreier is, when they don't want to talk about the bill at hand, they talk about everything else around it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reality is that the bill at hand, the rule that we are trying to move forward to bring a bill to the House floor today, eliminates privatization of tax collection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, my Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle love privatization. They love it in Iraq where it has not worked and our military is struggling under the burden of having privatization and contractors, war contractors not doing what they should be doing and charging four times what they should be charging to do it. We see all of the problems that have happened there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen the same thing happen here in the United States where Federal contracts have been let. Mr. Waxman's committee has done incredible work rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the private contractor system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then they want to turn over the collection system of the IRS to private hands, putting at risk all Americans' private information and documents. They like privatization; they just don't like protecting your privacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from California talked about all kinds of issues but he didn't talk about the root problem that we are trying to address here, and that is stopping bounty hunters from harassing American taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. Dreier talked at great length about the McCrery substitute and the fact that Mr. McCrery has not gotten a substitute this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is the second time this year that I have managed a rule where the Republican substitute has violated the House rules. I am a member of the Blue Dog Coalition as well as being a member of the Rules Committee. I am very proud that for the whole time I have been here as a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, we advocated for advancement of the PAYGO rule. We believe in fiscal responsibility. We believe we need to pay our debts. So we got, when we took over the majority, inserted into  the House rules a clause that says we have to pay as we go. We have to do it like every American taxpayer has to run their own home. We have to run this House in a fiscally responsible way. And so we mandated the PAYGO rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The substitute put forward by the Republicans, for the second time that I have managed a rule anyway, has violated those PAYGO rules. When you don't follow the House rules, you can't expect your amendment to be made in order, Mr. Speaker. I encourage my colleagues to abide by those rules and honor the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400367" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I don't know if this is a blatant attempt to mislead Members or not, but the gentleman, Mr. English, his bill is compliant with PAYGO rules. And to suggest on this floor that the Republican Party presented the bill, the amendment----</paragraph>

You specifically stated: We want an amendment that would be in compliance with the PAYGO rules; will you please give it to us. And we were turned down by the Rules Committee. I would engage the gentleman on that issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was my amendment that I made, and I know how the gentleman voted, along with all of his colleagues. And to stand up on this floor and to say, Well, we would if they would abide by the rules, but they have to abide by the rules, is a blatant, blatant miscalculation and I think untrue and insincere. When we asked for that in the Rules Committee, we were turned down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we said, Give us an amendment we will make sure that the Parliamentarian and others say is compliant, we were turned down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman, Mr. English, and I am getting ready to allow him to speak on this floor, he is in compliance with PAYGO rules. So there was not an opportunity that was given by the Rules Committee to allow us to do that. And then you stand up and say, Well, if Republicans played by the same rules as we do, then they would find them in order, that is not true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 4 minutes to the co-chairman of the Zero AMT Caucus, the distinguished gentleman who has an amendment that would be compliant, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. English).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400123" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me and certifying in the process that I am PAYGO compliant, something that will come as a source of great relief to my wife, among others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule before us today. Very simply, it puts protecting deadbeat taxpayers ahead of shielding unsuspecting citizens from additional taxes and penalties resulting from the majority's inaction on the AMT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, I offered an amendment in the nature of a substitute to the underlying bill. My amendment would have addressed the severe consequences to middle-class taxpayers come next April as a result of the majority's inaction on the alternative minimum tax. As has been noted here, this amendment was fully compliant with PAYGO rules of the House, but it was dismissed out of hand by the majority. As a result, I am here today to strongly urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question on the  rule so it can be amended to incorporate consideration of the English substitute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact remains that the clock is ticking, and without a minimum amount of effort by this majority in Congress, millions of taxpayers will not only be socked with an unsuspected bill from the tax man in the form of the AMT, they will also be slapped with punitive penalties by the IRS for not withholding enough as AMT taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would have created a safe harbor for those taxpayers and not penalized them for something that they did not know they would be subjected to; and, frankly, something they never should have been subject to in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Let's put this in more concrete terms, Mr. Speaker. There are now less than 30 legislative days left in this Congress. So far a bill has yet to be introduced by the majority to spare 23 million American taxpayers from unintentionally being subject to the alternative minimum tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, after having 10 months of the year to deal with this impending explosion of increased taxes on working families, the majority has done absolutely nothing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the longest period of time the AMT has been pushed aside, and it is incomprehensible that we're not addressing the fallout from this inaction today, even as forms are being prepared to send out to taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Working families should not have to pay the price for the majority's inaction on the AMT. In fact, Mr. Speaker, they can't afford to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I oppose this rule because it embraces the misplaced priorities of the majority to chase phantasms rather than deliver real and meaningful legislation to spare working families from a huge tax increase that was never intended for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My substitute would strike the repeal of the private debt collection program and put in place a safe harbor for unsuspecting taxpayers about to be clobbered by the AMT and then again by penalties. Otherwise, my substitute would leave the bill unchanged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have to come to grips with the fact that we have to address the AMT. We must do it now. I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question and bring a rule to the floor that addresses the immediate and pressing needs of working families in this country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to commend my colleague Mr. English. He is a very thoughtful individual and a very good legislator, and I would just say that while his amendment was PAYGO compliant, we were not aware of that until this morning when the tax tables were submitted to the Ways and Means Committee. So last night when the Rules Committee was dealing with this issue, we had no way of knowing whether his substitute was, in fact, PAYGO compliant or not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to Mr. McCrery's substitute, I have it here with me. The substitute that was submitted by Mr. McCrery was, in fact, not PAYGO compliant. Now, Mr. Sessions says that he made the motion to allow it to be PAYGO compliant, but the bill before us at that point in the Rules Committee was not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to say, also, that Mr. English's substitute doesn't deal with the base bill, which is to stop the privatization of tax collection, and that is what the majority is trying to get at today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, certainly there are other issues that are worthy of consideration in this institution. AMT is certainly one of them. But in this provision today, the majority wants to bring forward a bill that would stop American taxpayers from being harassed by private bounty hunters. That's the issue before us today. And all the other issues that people are trying to discuss one way or another, they have nothing to do with this base bill and really don't apply to the debate we want to have in the next  hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would like to inquire upon the time remaining on both sides, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman from Texas has 4 minutes, and the gentleman from California has 15 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400367" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let's go to the heart of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>$30 million worth of uncollected taxes that, by the IRS's own admission, never would have been collected because they were accounts they did not want to or were not working, which are the only accounts that ever go to private debt collectors, who as private collectors receive a 98 percent rating from the IRS for regulatory procedural accuracy, as well as a 100 percent rating for professionalism, and less than 1 percent of those accounts have any sort of complaints that are filed with the IRS,  and none which have been validated. That's the substance of the case. That's why we oppose this bill and this rule. It makes no sense unless you're simply trying to do what union bosses ask you to do, which is evidently what this bill is doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to point out that what's very interesting is that this bill is supported by the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and has a whopping nine cosponsors, a whopping nine cosponsors, and we're bringing that to the floor of the House today. Utterly amazing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I insert into the Record at this time the Statement of Administration Policy by the President, which this White House says that they will veto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Statement of Administration Policy</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>--To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the authority of the Internal Revenue Service to use private debt collection companies, to delay implementation of withholding taxes on government contractors, to revise the tax rules on expatriation, and for other purposes</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administration strongly opposes House passage of <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>. The bill is not consistent with the Administration's commitment to a balanced approach toward improving taxpayer compliance and collecting outstanding tax liabilities. If <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill> were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administration strongly opposes the provisions of the bill that would repeal the current statutory authorization for the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, private debt collection program. Terminating this program would result in a loss of significant revenue over the next 10 years. These are tax dollars that are legally owed to the Government and that are otherwise not likely to be collected by the IRS. It is a disservice to all taxpayers who properly pay their taxes to terminate this program  that is efficiently recovering a portion of the extra burden they shoulder from the "tax gap" caused by those who do not pay their taxes. Moreover, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, recently reported that the IRS has made "major progress" in addressing critical success factors for the private debt collection program, including ensuring that both taxpayer rights and the security of taxpayer information are protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administration also has concerns with the provision of the bill that would impose additional tax rules on individuals relinquishing U.S. citizenship or terminating long-term residency. The Administration strongly supports efforts to ensure that individuals renouncing their U.S. citizenship pay their fair share of U.S. taxes. The bill's "mark-to-market" approach to valuation of expatriates' property for taxation purposes, however, overrides existing tax treaties and raises concerns about  tax complexity.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400367" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have had a good debate here on the floor. We talked about from the Republican perspective, we're trying to follow the rules, not only of the House, but also the statements that have been made by our new Speaker, the Honorable Nancy Pelosi, who said she would have the most honest, open and ethical House in history and that that would also extend to processes of amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are here on the floor of the House saying today, that's not happening, has not happened all year, and I would predict to say today probably is not about to happen. Still on the Web site for the Speaker it says this. The American people are waiting for this promise to be made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we are debating a rule and a bill that would say to the American taxpayer that the IRS and their ability to collect taxes on behalf of the American people is going to be changed, changed from accounts that the IRS has no reasonable reason to believe that they will be chasing after or trying to collect. And that's why in the first place we said from doing audits, you've got all these accounts, please pass them to someone who will do it on behalf of the taxpayer. Because if you're not trying  to collect these bills, it means that people will never pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The result has been over $30 million worth of uncollected taxes that never would have been collected, not by the IRS, and they're done by someone, these private collection agencies, that receive a 98 percent rating by the IRS for regulatory and procedural accuracy, as well as a 100 percent rating for  professionalism and less than a 1 percent complaint rate of which not one has turned out to be validated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is an assault on not just the taxpayer. This is an assault on really good and effective and proper government, where the IRS utilizes best practice. They're utilized by over 40 State governments today to have help in collecting money that is owed not just to the government but to the taxpayers of this Nation. And today, despite the success, overwhelming success, that is occurring, the Democrat majority, with nine cosponsors plus the chairman, is interested in taking away this  opportunity for the taxpayers, I will assume, because the taxpayer union of the Treasury Department does not like this happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we need to have best practices. The President is right. He will veto this bill. This is a valiant effort by this Democrat majority to pay back AFL-CIO and the labor unions for their support, but it is not in the best interests of not only the taxpayer but of good and proper government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican Party is here on the floor of the House today saying that what has happened with best practices that is happening today should continue. We should have these private services that work in concert with the IRS. We should continue to give the IRS and those particular departments that do go after this money to receive directly more money that is collected that would help them hire more tax collectors, but we should not stop this process dead in its tracks because not only is it successful,  but it is working as a best practice would for other people to see how important a public/private partnership is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material to appear in the Record just prior to the vote on the previous question.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act of 2007, stops wasting taxpayer money on programs that cost too much, gives away confidential taxpayer information, and results in taxpayer harassment by bounty hunters and simply never has and never will work. It didn't work in the early 1800s, it didn't work in the late 1800s, and it doesn't work in the year 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Sessions mentioned that there are these Republican best practices that would enhance our collection methods. Well, let's talk about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican bill spent $71 million to collect $20 million, resulting in a $51 million loss. If Mr. Sessions wants to claim those as Republican best practices, he can do that. However, if the Federal Government employees, the traditional men and women who have served our country honorably, if they had had the ability to use that same $71 million, they would have collected $1.5 billion in taxes owed to this Treasury, $1.5 billion that could be used to, well, maybe fund SCHIP so that  our poor young children could get the health care they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Sessions talks about that this bill only has 11 cosponsors. Well, this bill is a compilation of bills that was put together in the last few weeks, and, in fact, the base bills that this bill is based upon, Mr. Van Hollen's bill has 156 coauthors and Mr. Meek of Florida's bill has over 100. So there is wide support for this bill. The public should not believe that there are just a few folks thinking this is a good idea. This has wide support. It has had a number  of hearings in the Ways and Means Committee, and there has been great testimony with regard to the fact that the current program put in by the Republicans in the last few years has not and will not work and should not continue to be allowed as the law of the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill> does something very fundamental. It protects taxpayers and ensures their privacy. It addresses withholding concerns raised by business and local government. It cracks down on yet another tax loophole for the wealthy that has been left open under the prior Congresses for far too long, and, most importantly, it continues to make our taxes fair for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. It deserves this House's strong support. I urge a "yes" vote on the rule and on the previous question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. HERGER Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Rule on <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act. This rule, on legislation to halt collection of previously uncollected tax debts, wrongly prohibits any Republican amendments. An Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute by Ways and Means Ranking Member JIM MCCRERY, would have allowed for consideration of full repeal of the 3 percent withholding burden, which is so important to thousands of U.S. businesses. This was rejected by  the Rules Committee on Tuesday evening. This rule stifles debate and is counter-productive to the bipartisanship we've worked for this year on the 3 percent withholding repeal. I urge my colleagues to reject the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The material previously referred to by Mr. Sessions is as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amendment to <bill type="hr" number="719">H. Res. 719</bill> Offered by Mr. Sessions of Texas</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Strike all after the resolved clause and insert the following: That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the bill (<bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the authority of the Internal Revenue Service to use private debt collection companies, to delay implementation of withholding taxes on government contractors, to revise the tax rules on expatriation, and for other purposes. All points of order against consideration of the  bill are waived except those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI. The amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means now printed in the bill, modified by the amendment printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions of the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, to final passage without intervening motion except: (1)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sec. 2. During consideration of <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill> pursuant to this resolution; notwithstanding the operation of the previous question, the Chair may postpone further consideration of the bill to such time as may be designated by the Speaker.</paragraph>

"(2) RECOGNITION OF GAIN OR LOSS.--In the case of any sale under paragraph (1)--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(A) notwithstanding any other provision of this title, any gain arising from such sale shall be taken into account for the taxable year of the sale, and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

"(2) DETERMINATION OF TAX WITH RESPECT TO PROPERTY.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the additional tax attributable to any property is an amount which bears the same ratio to the additional tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year solely by reason of subsection (a) as the gain taken into account under subsection (a) with respect to such property bears to the total gain taken into account under subsection (a) with respect to all property to which subsection (a) applies.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(3) TERMINATION OF EXTENSION.--The due date for payment of tax may not be extended under this subsection later than the due date for the return of tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year which includes the date of death of the expatriate (or, if earlier, the time that the security provided with respect to the property fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (4), unless the taxpayer corrects such failure within the time specified by the Secretary).&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(4) SECURITY.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(A) IN GENERAL.--No election may be made under paragraph (1) with respect to any property unless adequate security is provided with respect to such property.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

  <narrative>The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means</narrative>
  <narrative>This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Democratic majority agenda and a vote to allow the opposition, at least for  the moment, to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of Representatives, (VI, 308-311) describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as "a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge." To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that "the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the  previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition" in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry,</narrative>
  <narrative>Because the vote today may look bad for the Democratic majority they will say "the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution ..... [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever." But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the definition of the previous question used in the Floor Procedures Manual published by the Rules Committee in the 109th Congress, (page 56). Here's how the Rules  Committee described the rule using information form Congressional Quarterly's "American Congressional Dictionary": "If the previous question is defeated, control of debate shifts to the leading opposition member (usually the minority Floor Manager) who then manages an hour of debate and may offer a germane amendment to the pending business."</narrative>
  <narrative>Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled "Amending Special Rules" states: "a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate." (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to  the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon."</narrative>
  <narrative>Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Democratic majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan.</narrative>
