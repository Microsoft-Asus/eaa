    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sadness, but also to honor the life and memory of the gentlewoman from Indiana that passed this week, Congresswoman Julia Carson. Julia will be remembered as a political trailblazer, a tireless advocate and dedicated public servant to the people of Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her life was a shining example of the power of the American Dream: rising from the humble beginnings of poverty and segregation to become a leading champion for civil rights, women's rights and the working poor in this House. She leaves behind a legacy of standing up for those most vulnerable among us. But most of all, JULIA accomplished what we should all strive to do. She left the world a better place than what she found it. She will be deeply missed by this House, by me, and by the  people of Indiana. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends during this difficult time.</paragraph>
