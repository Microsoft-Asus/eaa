  <narrative>2006 SLOAN AWARD WINNERS</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I congratulate the 2006 winners of the Alfred P. Sloan Award for Business Excellence in Workplace Flexibility, which recognizes companies that have successfully used flexibility to meet both business and employee goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I did last year, I wish to draw attention to the Sloan Awards because I think these companies are to be commended for their excellence in providing workplace flexibility practices which benefit both employees and employers. Achieving greater flexibility in the workplace--to maximize productivity while attracting the highest quality employees--is one of the key challenges facing American companies in the 21st century.</paragraph>

The Chamber of Commerce in each city hosted an interactive business forum to share research on workplace flexibility as an important component of workplace  effectiveness.
