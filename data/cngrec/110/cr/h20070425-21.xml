  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, yesterday, as the Nation looked on, once again Indiana law enforcement, State, county and city personnel, showed their professionalism and courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to commend the swift response by Indiana State and local authorities to quell the disturbance that began at 2:01 p.m. at New Castle Correctional Facility, at the very heart of my congressional district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During a routine transfer from a dining hall to their cellblocks, a group of inmates removed their shirts, an officer was knocked to the ground, and the situation quickly spiraled out of control involving nearly one-third of the prison's population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Guards quickly isolated the areas of disturbance. As the Nation looked on over the cable airwaves, backup officers arrived just 15 minutes later. The Indiana Department of Correction activated its Special Emergency Response Team and involved the State police. All offenders and the facility were secured by 4:45.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Investigations will go forward and questions will be answered, but, Madam Speaker, on behalf of the citizens of eastern Indiana, I rise to express my pride and gratitude to the law enforcement community involved, the State, the local, the city and the county, all those who ensured that this disturbance was contained, tragedy was averted, and the people of my congressional district were protected.</paragraph>
