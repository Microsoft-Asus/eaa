    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to commend our colleague, Representative MARK UDALL, for his hard work on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of us know, clean water is one of the most precious commodities in the West. The bill before us, <bill type="h" number="902">H.R. 902</bill>, has a promise of providing more clean water to western communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In oil and gas fields with thousands of producing wells, millions of gallons of so-called produced water will be brought to the surface along with oil or gas. To those who operate oil and gas wells, produced water is a waste product. In some cases, the produced water can be injected into the wells to force more oil to the surface. If the water quality is good enough, a well operator might be allowed to discharge the water down the nearest stream, but there may also be opportunities to treat the  water and make it useful for irrigation or even domestic purposes. <bill type="h" number="902">H.R. 902</bill> authorizes a study of the opportunities and the obstacles to beneficial and environmentally safe use of this produced water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I again commend Mr. Udall for his hard work on this legislation. In the 109th Congress, the Subcommittee on Water and Power held a hearing on similar legislation. This legislation was subsequently passed by the House. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am here to support <bill type="h" number="902">H.R. 902</bill> introduced by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Udall). I have cosponsored legislation authorizing the Department of the Interior to study the potential use of extracted water from oil and gas production for irrigation and other purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will not surprise anyone in this Chamber that water is the most important resource in the West. Water is the lifeblood of the American West and the foundation of its economy. Yet it is also the scarcest resource in some of the fastest-growing areas of the country. But we can go beyond that and declare that water is the most strategic asset in the entire world. It may surprise some in this Chamber that the potential source of good-quality water lies just beneath the surface and is being wasted  every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the process of oil and gas development, approximately 924 billion gallons of water is extracted throughout the year, with most of that water being pumped back underground. Some significant share of that water is already being used for irrigation and livestock watering, but converting just 1 percent more of that total to additional beneficial use would yield over 75 billion gallons of more usable water for irrigation, ranching, fish and wildlife enhancement, stream augmentation or drinking  water. The produced water that contains the lowest concentration of total dissolved solids, or TDS, less than 10,000 parts per million, is found in the western United States where water is a critical resource.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Often the largest hurdle to beneficial use of water produced from oil and gas production is finding the technology to accomplish water treatment in a cost-effective manner. Water treatment must compete with the lower-cost option of deep well injection. And while deep well injection is the most environmentally sound method of disposal, it forgoes the opportunity to use millions of gallons as a resource.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beneficial use of this water in these arid environments will be a win-win situation for the energy industry, water consumers, and oil and gas consumers. This legislation will facilitate the potential use of this abundant water for irrigation uses and other beneficial purposes. It could potentially help us find new water from what is now a virtually untapped water resource.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Colorado for introducing this legislation, and urge my colleagues to support the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Edwards).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400118" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me begin by first thanking the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) for his excellent explanation of what is in this bill. I will not repeat all of the details of this bill, but the bottom line of this legislation is that America needs energy, America needs clean energy, and America needs clean water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My district in central and north Texas basically is in the heart of one of the largest natural gas fields in American history, the Barnett Shale, and we are blessed to be in that situation where we are producing natural gas for not only Texas citizens, but families and businesses throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Natural gas is one of the cleanest forms of energy for this country to run our factories and to heat our homes. Because it is priced on a regional basis rather than on a world basis, every extra thousand cubic feet of natural gas we can produce is going to make America more competitive in the world market by bringing those prices down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is going to help us continue utilizing great natural resources such as the Barnett Shale by establishing pilot projects whereby we can learn how to more efficiently recycle the massive amounts of water that are used to, in effect, crack the shale,  divide the shale where this Barnett Shale field exists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is estimated that one well alone can require 3 1/2  to 5 million gallons of water to basically break up that shale so we can bring the natural gas to the surface and utilize it in our homes and businesses. Right now much of that water is either being injected back down into the earth or literally carted away at great expense to be disposed of at other sites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What a great benefit to the natural gas industry and families and businesses and communities all across America if we can recycle that water in an environmentally friendly way for the benefit of our farmers and ranchers, for the benefit of local communities that could use that water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seldom do we see in this House and on this floor a bill that businesses, the oil and gas industry, and environmentalists can be behind. I commend the gentleman and his coauthor, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Udall), for having developed this legislation. It is nice to see bipartisanship on the floor of the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is good for America. It does what its title says, More Water, More Energy. That is what this bill is all about. That is why I enthusiastically support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the gentleman from Colorado for agreeing to my request to add Texas to the possible list of pilot sites for this project. Again, the home of the Barnett Shale in Texas is, I think, the largest producing gas field today. I think it is appropriate that Texas be included in this list of potential pilot projects. This is good legislation not just for Texans, it is good for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman and all of those involved who put this legislation together.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400313" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, many times people have asked exactly how does this work on the ground. For instance, in my home county of Lea County, New Mexico, we have the Ogallala Aquifer. We are right at the very edge of it. And in the 50 years we have been pumping out of the aquifer, we have used about 50 percent of the water that is available to us. There is no surface water available, only that aquifer water is available. We have used 50 percent of it, and it would take 1,900 years to recharge  what has been used, and so we understand that we are on the downward slide for having water available to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Lea County, New Mexico, we produce over 150,000 barrels of water yearly, and that water is reinjected. If that water were available to be cleaned up, that water would be available for development, industry and jobs. It is a very important thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The county right next is Eddy County. Water is produced there that is fresher than water in the Pecos River, and yet law and regulation requires the disposal of that water back down into salt zones. Everyone in the West understands that at some point we are going to go back and repump that water to the surface, this time for use as water. Right now it is free at the surface. It is a by-product of the oil and gas exploration, and yet we are required to put that water back down into wells, into  the salt zones, where it is going to be very much harder to clean up the next time we use it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this bill represents a great opportunity for us to take a step forward to benefit the industry in the West, to benefit the residents of the West, and to help lower the cost of production of oil and gas. It seems to be a win-win situation every way that we look at it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I compliment the gentleman from Texas and the gentleman from Colorado for introducing this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. UDALL of Colorado, Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, <bill type="h" number="902">H.R. 902</bill>, the "More Water and More Energy Act, and to express my thanks to Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Don Young of the Natural Resources Committee for making it possible for the House to consider it today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill's purpose is to facilitate the use of water produced in connection with development of energy resources for irrigation and other uses in ways that will not adversely affect water quality or the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is similar to a bill I introduced in the 109th Congress that passed the House last year but on which the Senate did not complete legislative action. It is cosponsored by Representative PEARCE of New Mexico, who is the ranking Republican member on the Natural Resources Committee's Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources and also by Representative EDWARDS of Texas. I greatly appreciate their support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the bill may help change an energy-industry problem into an opportunity, not just for oil and gas producers but for everyone else who would benefit from increased supplies of useable water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Especially in the arid west, that covers everyone--not least our hard-pressed ranchers and farmers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The focus of the bill is the underground water extracted in connection with development of energy sources like oil, natural gas or coalbed methane. It would do two things:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it would direct the Bureau of Reclamation and the USGS to identify the obstacles to greater use of produced water and the how those obstacles could be reduced or eliminated without adversely affecting water quality or the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, it would provide for Federal help in building 3 pilot plants to demonstrate ways to treat produced water to make it suitable for irrigation or other uses, again without adversely affecting water quality or the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At least one of these pilot plants would be in Colorado, Utah, or Wyoming. At least one would be in New Mexico, Arizona or Nevada. And there would be at least one each in California and Texas. This is to assure that, together, the plants would demonstrate techniques applicable to a variety of geologic and other conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the bill, the federal government could pay up to half the cost of building each plant, but no more than $1 million for any one plant. No federal funds could be used for operating the plants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill's goal is reflected in its title--the "More Water and More Energy Act of 2006."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The extent of its potential benefits was shown by the testimony of Mr. David Templet at a hearing on the similar bill of mine the House considered last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Templet testified in support of that bill on behalf of the Domestic Petroleum Council and several other groups, including the Colorado Oil &amp; Gas Association. He noted that produced water is the most abundant byproduct associated with the production of oil and gas, with about 18 billion barrels being generated by onshore wells in 1995.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And he pointed out that if only an additional 1 percent of that total could be put to beneficial use, the result would be to make over 75 billion gallons annually available for use for irrigation or other agriculture, municipal purposes, or to benefit fish and wildlife.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, remember that in the west we usually measure water by the acre-foot--the amount that would cover an acre to the depth of one foot--and an acre-foot is about 32,8560 gallons, so an additional 75 billion gallons is more than 230,000 acre feet--more water, indeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And at the same time making produced water available for surface uses, instead of just reinjecting it into the subsurface, can help increase the production of oil and gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At last year's hearing, this was illustrated by the testimony of Dr. David Stewart, a registered professional engineer from Colorado. He cited the example of an oil field in California from which an estimated additional 150 million barrels of oil could be recovered if water were removed from the subsurface reservoir. And he pointed out that where oil recovery is thermally enhanced, a reduced amount of underground water means less steam--and so less cost--is needed to recover the oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The potential for having both more water and more energy is also illustrated by the example of a project near Wellington, Colorado, that treats produced water as a new water resource. I had the opportunity to visit it just last week, and found it very interesting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An oil company is embarking on the project to increase oil production while a separate company will purchase the produced water to supplement existing supplies, eventually allowing the town of Wellington and other water users in the area to have increased water for drinking and other purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In view of its potential for leading to both "more water" and "more energy" I was pleased but not surprised that last year the Administration, through the Interior Department, testified that it "agrees that the goals of the bill are commendable and the needs that could be addressed are real" and that the roles the bill would assign to the Bureau of Reclamation and the USGS are consistent with the missions and expertise of those agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In view of all this, Madam Speaker, I submit that this bill--and its promise of helping provide our country with both more water and more energy--deserves the support of the House, and I urge its approval.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
