  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday the House lost one of its own. It is with great sadness and heavy heart that I rise today to honor the memory of Darrell Norman and his service to the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Norman collapsed on these premises and died yesterday. Darrell Norman lived in the District of Columbia and served the institution with distinction and excellence as a senior technical support representative for more than 20 years. His colleagues tell us that they will miss his infectious smile and spirit. His daughter, Monea, actually interned in my office for part of 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kindhearted, professional, and dedicated are words used by Darrell's colleagues to describe him. He is known throughout the House as a person you can rely on to do whatever it takes to get the job done. He has earned the reputation as a person with calm demeanor, steady work ethic, and respect for everyone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Darrell's kindheartedness and drive to serve others was reflected in his work and set a tone for collegial comradery with customers and colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His service to the House is respected by the Members, chairmen, officers, and staff that have benefited from his unwavering disposition and willingness to serve in any role needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Darrell was always willing to volunteer his time to assist others. His participation on the House emergency preparedness and response teams as a critical staff member was above and beyond his daily responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Energy and enthusiasm were his trademark characteristics and earned him recognition as a "CAO All Star" for his "can do" attitude and living his philosophy to never say no. You could always count on Darrell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Admired by the people who knew him and appreciated by those he served, Darrell was an exceptional role model. He received the CAO award for distinguished service in acknowledgement of his consistent and selfless service to the U.S. House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Keeping the House an important part of his life did not eclipse Darrell's pride in his children. His eyes would light up and his chest expanded every time he spoke of his daughter and son. Darrell is survived by his mother, Mary Norman, his younger sister Dorita Norman Smith, his younger brother Jeffrey Norman, his daughter Monea Hendricks and his son Darrell Norman, Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a privilege to pay respects to a man who lived the spirit of unconditional service. On behalf of the entire House community, we extend our condolences to Darrell's family, friends and colleagues in mourning the loss of a special man.</paragraph>
