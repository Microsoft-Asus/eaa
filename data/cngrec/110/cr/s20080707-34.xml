    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3226">S. 3226</bill>] Mr. President, I would like to introduce a bill to rename the "Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site" in the State of Kentucky as the "Abraham Lincoln Birthplace Historical Park."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1809, Abraham Lincoln was born at Sinking Spring Farm, near Hodgenville, Kentucky, making him the first President to be born outside the original Thirteen Colonies. A century later, in 1916, the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site was established to protect over 100 acres of this enshrined area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1811, the Lincoln family moved from Sinking Spring Farm to Knob Hill Farm, Kentucky, until Abraham Lincoln was nearly 8 years old. At the age of 51, Abraham Lincoln wrote, "My earliest recollection is the Knob Creek place." While at Knob Hill, Abraham Lincoln learned to talk and assume household duties, helping his family gather wood and water. It was also at Knob Hill, during his boyhood years, where Lincoln first saw African Americans being taken south along the Louisville-Nashville Turnpike,  part of the old Cumberland Road, to be sold as slaves. Only 50 years later, Abraham Lincoln would successfully lead his Nation through its worst crisis to abolish slavery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is an inspiring climb from modest beginnings to the highest office in the land, along with a relentless spirit through the most distressing time in the history of our Nation, which opens us to the life of Abraham Lincoln.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As someone who is proud to share the same birth State with Abraham Lincoln, I believe there is a credible desire in Kentucky to continue the education and promotion among our citizens, particularly the young, to understand and appreciate his righteous leadership. It is difficult to name another person who has displayed the qualities and character of the U.S. as much as Abraham Lincoln.</paragraph>
