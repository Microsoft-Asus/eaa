  <narrative>CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY -- (Senate - November 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13722">S13722</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I thank the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Minnesota, for the work she has done on the issue I will talk about today--consumer product safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, our Nation has witnessed recall after recall after recall of contaminated products--toys, vitamins, pet food, tires, the list goes on and on. Our fundamentally flawed trade policy, mixed with an indifferent--or worse--consumer protection agency, has eroded nearly 40 years of safety standards in our Nation. In the past, until the last few years, our safety standards assured parents they could trust that their children's toys were lead free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are now trying to strengthen the Consumer Protection Safety Commission. I am a cosponsor of the legislation authored by Senator Pryor that will help strengthen that agency--the agency charged with keeping our families safe from contaminated products--whether it is toys or other products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this week, however, a New York Times story revealed that the CPSC Acting Chairwoman, Nancy Nord, is actively working against these improvements, lobbying Congress to kill this bill. That is shameful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This morning's Washington Post revealed that, in addition to fighting agency improvements, Chairwoman Nord has enjoyed trips across the country and around the world, paid for by the very toy companies she is responsible for regulating. That is outrageous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These were trips paid for by the toy industry, the industry that is now under scrutiny for cutting corners--cutting corners that earn big profits for industry CEOs and sends toxic toys into our children's bedrooms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Parents have the right to trust that their children's toys are safe. Every American has the right to trust that their Government is doing its job to keep us safe. Sadly, that does not appear to be the case with the CPSC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Chairwoman Nord claims her agency simply doesn't have the resources to do the job right. She claims the legislation now working its way through Congress would overburden her agency. Why then, one must ask, did Chairwoman Nord fail to ask for more money when she met with the Appropriations Committee earlier this year? The 2008 budget she defended before Congress doesn't even account for inflation. It leaves this agency less well equipped to prevent harm to children and to the rest of us.  She stood up before the House Financial Services Appropriations Subcommittee and defended this budget, never once asserting the need for additional resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What better opportunity could Chairwoman Nord have had to improve her agency? What better opportunity could she have had to protect our families? But she failed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CPSC budget is half what it was when it was created in the 1970s--in the days when most toys and consumer products were made in this country. We imported last year $288 billion worth of products from China, tens of billions of dollars of products and toys from China and other countries that don't have a regulatory system or a Consumer Product Safety Commission or a system in place to protect consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this time, the CPSC staff dwindled from nearly 1,000 to 420. We must increase funding and staff to the CPSC. We need to increase coordination between the CPSC and Customs officials. We must give the CPSC the authority to examine and approve other nations' regulatory systems before imports from those countries show up in our children's bedrooms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need a leader at the CPSC who supports these goals. It is clear that Chairwoman Nord does not. She has been given the responsibility of doing everything in her power to keep our families safe and our children safe. Instead, Chairwoman Nord supports an abysmal agency budget request, is actively working against efforts to strengthen her agency, and takes trips funded by manufacturers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairwoman Nancy Nord should step down. It is time to put a chairperson in place who is not satisfied with: We are doing the best we can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need a chairperson who fights for the authority and the resources the CPSC needs to do the job it is supposed to do--protect our families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need real leadership at the CPSC--leadership that doesn't side with manufacturers over consumer safety, leadership that stands up to industry pressure, leadership that puts our children and our families first.</paragraph>
