  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this resolution concerns a pro se civil action filed against Senator EVAN BAYH, in which plaintiff alleges, as best as can be pieced together from the complaint, which offers no factual support, that the Senator intervened in the processing of plaintiffs FOIA request to the Department of the Treasury to block access to documents in order to protect the identities of constituents whose names would have been revealed in the documents and who, according to plaintiff,  had violated plaintiffs civil and constitutional rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel to represent Senator BAYH in this suit and to move for its dismissal on both threshold jurisdictional grounds and failure to state a claim on the merits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the Senate to approve this important legislation.</paragraph>
