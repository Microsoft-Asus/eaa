  <narrative>HONORING THE 99TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NAACP -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H819]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412232" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for nearly a century, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the NAACP, has been fighting for the civil rights and dignity of people of color. As a result of their efforts, our great Nation today can boast of a society more diverse, productive, prosperous and hopeful than any in history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, today's hope is a far cry from the violent segregation and discrimination that inspired Mary White Ovington, William English Walling and Dr. Henry Moskowitz to meet in a small room of a New York City apartment and commit the fledgling NAACP to the most important social movement in our national history. Today, the spirit of those brave and patriotic founders lives on in its leaders, like Dr. Joan Duval-Flynn, president of the Media, Pennsylvania NAACP chapter in my home district. I rise  today to congratulate Dr. Duval-Flynn for her vision, intelligence and dedication. She leads a chapter of the NAACP born of a violent act in the early 1920s and committed to making Delaware County, Pennsylvania, a 21st century community where people of all colors and creeds live together as neighbors, friends and first-class citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my first year representing the Seventh District of Pennsylvania, the NAACP's magazine, The Crisis, featured an article titled "Woman Warriors, Female Combatants Sacrifice Lives for Country." That article gave me cause to consider all of the extraordinary women and men of color I had the privilege of serving with during my 30 years in our Armed Forces. For that privilege and honor, I owe, and our Nation owes, a personal debt of gratitude to Dr. Duval-Flynn, Mary White Ovington and countless  other members and leaders of the NAACP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As W.E.B. Du Bois wrote in his first editorial page of The Crisis in 1910, that voice of the NAACP "will stand for the rights of men, irrespective of color or race, for the highest ideals of American democracy, and for the reasonable but earnest and persistent attempt to gain these rights and realize these ideals." No truer words can be spoken than on this birthday of the NAACP. I am proud, therefore, to know and work with this one remarkable leader, Dr. Joan Duval-Flynn, in my district as  with many others in my district and with the NAACP who gave us leaders such as she.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded on February 12, 1909, the NAACP is the Nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization. It has worked successfully with allies of all races who believe in, and stand for, the principles of civil rights on which the organization was founded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NAACP's legacy includes historic events as well as distinguished leaders, as I mentioned, W.E.B. Du Bois, but other civil rights leaders such as Rosa Parks and Medgar Evers and Thurgood Marshall, who served as special counsel for the NAACP when he argued the historic U.S. Supreme Court case of Brown v. Board of Education, a landmark victory for equality that outlawed segregation in our schools. Our obligation to African Americans and all Americans is to honor the accomplishments of the past  by acting in a substantive manner to improve their lives in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, NAACP; thank you, Dr. Joan Duval-Flynn; and thank you for the time this morning, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
