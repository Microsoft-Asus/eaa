    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share with my colleagues a small story from a small corner of America called Rowena, Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 20th century began with a tremendous movement of people to west Texas in search of good land, opportunity and prosperity. Among these intrepid travelers were many Czech and German Americans whose forefathers had come to Texas to farm, ply trades and create better lives. Their descendants found these lives in Rowena.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1906, four Rowena Catholics, William Glass, Mike Feist, Frank Schwertner and John Jansa, sought to erect a church to serve their community and better practice their faith. After a year of toil, the church opened and celebrated its first mass, a wedding, on November 20, 1907. The church was aptly dedicated to St. Joseph, the patron of immigrants, families and working people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>St. Joseph's grew rapidly during its early years, reflecting its growing significance in the community. In 1916, the church opened St. Joseph's School, with the Sisters of the Divine Providence serving as teachers. And in 1924, a new church in the gothic style was dedicated, and the annual fall festival was begun to support the church. To this day, the gothic church still stands, and the fall festival is still celebrated each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Soon the church began to host community-service organizations and social clubs as well. The Knights of Columbus, St. Ann's Altar Society, Catholic Daughters of America, the KJT, KJZT and the Immaculate Conception Society would all call the church home through the coming decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Great Depression and World War II would see an especially important role for St. Joseph's and its parish organizations to play as they led their rural community through troubling times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the church aged in the 1950s and in the 1960s, it prospered. It marked its 50th anniversary in 1957, and a new community space was constructed in 1961. And all the while, the high school continued to educate and graduate the youth of Rowena.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, as with all institutions, the church inevitably faced a period of decline. As the small town of Rowena began to lose population, difficult times ensued for the church. The parish school finally closed in the late 1970s, and church membership shrunk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shaken by these developments, the parish renewed its commitment to the sacraments, its members and its community. They reestablished religious instruction, revitalized their parish organizations, and moved into the modern age. Today, St. Joseph's is fittingly led by another immigrant, Father Bhaskar Morugudi from India.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2007 marks St. Joseph's centennial celebration. The belief of four men led to the creation of the parish, but it took the faith of a community to sustain it. Throughout the last 100 years, St. Joseph's has been the rock for the people of Rowena. It has educated their children, guided them through trouble and saved their souls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the parishioners of St. Joseph's look to the future, I urge them to remember the rich history that lies in their past. The legacy of their founders created in Rowena through service, education and salvation is inspiring. The church is woven into the threads of Rowena itself and highlights the history of America herself, and I feel privileged to share this story with you all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No matter who we are or where we're from, we can all find common ground in the story of St. Joseph's parish. It is a story of individuals seeking and creating a better life for themselves and their descendants, and of a people of deep devotion seeking to practice their beliefs and enrich their community. We should all strive to be so noble in our ambitions and generous in our spirits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I celebrate and honor the parishioners of St. Joseph's in Rowena, Texas as they reflect on the past and embark on another 100 years of ministry and service.</paragraph>
