    <paragraph>Madam President, I would like to take a moment to remember one of my constituents and a life-long New Yorker, Mary Sweeney of Niagara Falls. Seven years ago, it was my great honor to send congratulations to Mary and her husband John on the occasion of their 50th wedding anniversary. I know that her fighting spirit will live on through John and her children, Moira, John, Billy, and Brendan, and a large and loving family of grandchildren, nieces, and nephews.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in the Great Depression, Mary exemplified the hopes and dreams of New York families whom I have had the honor and privilege of representing in the Senate these past 8 years. Mary had an ardent appreciation for public service and the political process, and she remained true to her strong convictions throughout her life. She was a loving wife and mother who worked every day to ensure opportunities for her children. In retirement she enjoyed her many grand-children and great-grand-children  and she should be proud that the rewards of her commitment to her family, her church, and her community can be seen in the many accomplishments of her family and extended family and in the many loving tributes that have been shown to her since her passing.</paragraph>
