    <paragraph>Mr. President, the subject today is the tax gap. The tax gap is the difference between what is paid voluntarily in taxes by 85 percent of the American people and what is actually owed by people who do not pay all of the taxes that are legally owed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tax gap does not include things that are in the underground economy, nor does it include illegal earnings. The tax gap is certainly not a new issue. We have discussed it on the floor of the Senate many times. It has been an issue for previous administrations as well as this administration. In fact, I suspect the tax gap has been an issue for as long as there has been taxes. However, I would say in recent years the Finance Committee, on which I serve, has certainly brought a new focus to the  issue of the tax gap. This has been very much a bipartisan effort. I believe the level of attention given to the tax gap certainly reflects the energy and focus of the new chairman of the committee, Senator MAX BAUCUS from Montana. Chairman Baucus should be commended for his work in this area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to praise the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad of North Dakota, for putting an additional spotlight on the tax gap topic. The Finance Committee has been doing the hard work in this area, encouraging greater research by the Internal Revenue Service, asking for detailed reports and recommendations from the Treasury Department as well as the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, investigating specific aspects of the tax gap, holding hearings to explore the  details of the tax gap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the Finance Committee has been doing the most difficult work of all, actually passing significant legislation that would reduce the money that is not coming in because of the tax gap. This has not been easy. I find the tax gap is one of those issues here in Congress that is a little bit like the weather: Everyone talks about it but no one is doing as much as should be done about it. But the way people talk around here, they view the tax gap as somehow a cure-all for all budget problems.  The tax gap can be used to pay for the alternative minimum tax problem; if we want to expand spending on health care, tap into the tax gap; if we want to balance the budget, tap into the tax gap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the amount of faith people have put into it, the tax gap has suddenly become one of those magic elixirs the peddlers used to sell in the Old West. You know how they said it will cure all that ails you. That was the slogan used by those slick salesmen 100 years ago. So the tax gap has become the elixir for all fiscal problems. I am surprised folks do not think the tax gap would cure baldness, as an example. So let's get behind the dreams and get to the real story of the tax gap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to talk about three issues dealing with the tax gap. First, what is the estimate of the tax gap? Second, what are the elements of the tax gap? Finally, what do we actually do in addition to all of those things we have been doing to reduce the tax gap; in other words, to go after that final dollar we know is legally owed but not collected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, how is it the tax gap is estimated, and what is it? The Senate Finance Committee's Subcommittee on Taxation and Internal Revenue Service Oversight held a hearing 9 months ago, July 2006. It was chaired by the then-chairman of that subcommittee, Senator Kyl. We heard extensive testimony from senior IRS officials about how the tax gap is estimated. The tax gap has been based on reporting compliance efforts known as the Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many colleague will recall, these efforts were viewed as too intrusive into the lives of the taxpayers. So the last taxpayer compliance measurement program that was done was back in 1988. Senator Baucus and I recognized the need for the updated research and encouraged the Internal Revenue Service to look at research that could provide useful data, useful information, without unduly burdening the honest taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Internal Revenue Service then responded with a national research program. It is important to realize that the national research program only dealt with a portion of the entire tax gap, primarily focusing on individual income taxes and not dealing with corporate tax. There are still significant portions of the tax gap that are then based on that very old material going  back to some studies 20 years ago, particularly in the area of passthrough entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a chart here that will make reference to some of these portions, significant portions of the tax gap. This is easily brought to focus on the Internal Revenue chart we have here. Remember, this is for tax year 2001, the latest available information. You can see it is only those items in bold that have been updated from the recent national research program, primarily in the area of individual income taxes and self-employment taxes; these areas right here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be nice to have an update on all of this. But in order to get on top of it and get it done quickly, we asked the IRS to focus on these areas. With the colors, you can see it is only the green--underpayment of taxes--that we have high confidence in. The light blue has been recently updated. We have some better sense of what the costs are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, it is the yellow--the bigger parts of the chart--that is dependent upon the older numbers sometimes going back years and years. That is the yellow portion I have already referred to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In terms many can better understand, think of the yellow estimates as being the broad side of the barn in terms of accuracy. So there we have it. At the end of the day the tax gap, based on many old estimates, is thought to be $345 billion for tax year 2001. That reflects a noncompliance rate of 16 percent. So basically, 84 percent of the tax dollars are coming in as required by law. We have a tax gap then of a remaining 16 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now I will turn to what are the elements of the tax gap. Again the chart from the Internal Revenue Service provides a useful blueprint. Nonfiling is about $27 billion. These are the people who do not even file their taxes. Then there is the underreporting of $285 billion. The Internal Revenue Service divides that into four categories: individual taxes at $197 billion; employment taxes, $54 billion; corporate income taxes at $30 billion; and estate tax and excise taxes of $4 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Underpayment of taxes, which is the amount people admit they owe on their tax returns but do not pay on time, happens to be $33 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly individuals make up the biggest part, with individuals underreporting nonbusiness income and business income, and overstating adjustments, deductions, and exemptions being the elements of the tax gap for individuals. A good deal of this is concentrated in the areas of self-employment and schedule C of the tax return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now that we have gone through how we measure the tax gap and what makes up the tax gap, the most important thing people want to know is--they do not want a definition of the problem--what can be done to close it? That is what my constituents ask me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the real question is one I would state this way: What steps can be taken that are effective and will not unduly burden taxpayers? We have to bear in mind most taxpayers do comply, and a significant amount of noncompliance is unintentional. I think all Members recognize that in the zeal to get at the tax gap, we cannot wreck the lives of the honest taxpayers. Most of the taxpayers, 85 percent, are not a problem. We cannot be like the fellow who tears down his house to get at the mouse.  Members on the other side should be particularly sensitive to the mindset of not taking on the honest taxpayer when trying to take care of the problem of the 15 percent, given this was effectively what was being promoted in 1994 with the wholesale reform of health care. Proponents in 1994 wanted to change the health care system for 85 percent of the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This chart reflects the Internal Revenue Service's testimony before the Budget Committee and estimates the IRS activities will reduce the tax gap, the $345 billion total, by nearly $70 billion by the year 2007. This reflects $17 billion in direct enforcement revenue and the rest in direct compliance effects. So we start with that as the base, the work of the Internal Revenue Service, which is already reducing approximately 20 percent of the tax gap, with Commissioner Everson's statements last  year that the Internal Revenue Service could bring in somewhere between $50 billion and $100 billion a year without dramatically changing the relationship between the IRS and taxpayers;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>in other words, not being more egregious against the honest taxpayer. Well, the IRS is already doing that, according to its Commissioner.</paragraph>
