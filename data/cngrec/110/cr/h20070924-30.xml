  <narrative>The Clerk read the title of the resolution.</narrative>
  <narrative>The text of the resolution is as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="668">H. Res. 668</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas on May 17, 1954, the United States Supreme Court announced in Brown v. Board of Education (347 U.S. 483) that, "in the field of education, the doctrine of `separate but equal' has no place";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Brown decision recognized as a matter of law that the segregation of public schools deprived students of the equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in 1957, three years after the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision, the promise of access and equality within the realm of education remained unfilled in Little Rock, Arkansas, and throughout the Nation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on September 4, 1957, nine African American students who would later be deemed the Little Rock Nine, Minnijean Brown, Elizabeth Eckford, Ernest Green, Thelma Mothershed, Melba Pattillo, Gloria Ray, Terrence Roberts, Jefferson Thomas, and Carlotta Walls, were denied admittance to Little Rock Central High by the Arkansas National Guard at the order of the Arkansas Governor;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on September 23, 1957, the Little Rock Nine, armed with a Federal court order, again tried to attend Little Rock Central High and implement the law of the land, but protests and violence forced the group of students to leave the school;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on September 25, 1957, this Nation would realize a historic day when the Little Rock Nine, escorted by Federal troops at the order of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, successfully integrated Little Rock Central High;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas throughout their tenure at Little Rock Central High, the Little Rock Nine, with conviction and dignity, championed school integration despite death threats, verbal and physical assaults, school closings, and other adversities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Little Rock Nine are symbolic of the victorious dismantling of school segregation, as well as the full and equal participation in American society that all citizens are entitled to, and continue to advance such principles through the Little Rock Nine Foundation; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the significance of the Little Rock Nine and their actions have been acknowledged with numerous awards and recognitions, including the 2007 Little Rock Central High School Desegregation 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin, the Congressional Gold Medal in 1999, the inclusion of Little Rock Central High School in the National Park System in 1998, and the designation of Little Rock Central High School as a National Historic Landmark in 1982;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on the 50th anniversary of the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School by the Little Rock Nine, the Nation will celebrate this great civil rights achievement through forums and town halls, commemorations, and significantly, the dedication of a permanent Little Rock Central High School Museum and Visitor Center; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in 2007, as the Little Rock Nine and the entire Nation celebrates 50 years of integration, we must acknowledge recent setbacks to the guarantee of opportunity and inclusion within our educational system, in both K-12 and higher education: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) acknowledges and commemorates the 50th anniversary of the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School by the Little Rock Nine;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) encourages all Americans, upon this 50th anniversary, to recognize the historic contributions of the Little Rock Nine, who not only secured integration for Little Rock Central High School, but hundreds of thousands of schools across the country; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (3) commits itself, in the wake of recent challenges, to continuing the legacy of Brown v. Board of Education and the Little Rock Nine by protecting and advancing equal educational opportunity for all.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, I am pleased to join the entire Arkansas congressional delegation, Representatives VIC SNYDER, MARION BERRY, MIKE ROSS, JOHN BOOZMAN, all in celebrating the 50th anniversary of the integration of the Little Rock Central High School by the Little Rock Nine. I would like also to recognize the distinguished members of the House Judiciary Committee, Ranking Member LAMAR SMITH and former chairman, JIM SENSENBRENNER, who have joined me in the introduction  of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifty years ago, on September 25, 1957, the Little Rock Nine, as they were called, successfully challenged the status quo of "separate but equal." Three years earlier, we all recall the momentous Supreme Court decision of 1954 that ruled the 14th amendment's guarantee of equal protection prohibited segregation in the public schools. This landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision struck down the notorious State-sanctioned Jim Crow in the realm of education once and for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, this critical determination would not easily be accepted. It would take nine young strong and determined African American students to begin actually implementing the new laws of the land. These nine students, Minnijean Brown, Elizabeth Eckford, Ernest Green, Thelma Mothershed, Melba Pattillo, Gloria Ray, Terrence Roberts, Jefferson Thomas, and Carlotta Walls, implemented the promise of Brown v. The Board. In the footsteps of Rosa Parks, these students, too, started a movement to  dismantle years of segregation and inequalities in our public school systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the shoulders of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., these brave young nine boys and girls faced a hatred and a violence that is embarrassing to recall, and they faced it with nonviolent resistance. They were peaceful. Dr. King himself said "to meet physical force with soul force." And that is what they did. Dr. King asked the students to think of the big picture as they moved forward, for they were going to be the frame for that picture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So on September 25, 1957, the students who came to be known as the Little Rock Nine integrated Little Rock Central High School, and history was forever changed. Escorted by 1,000 members of the 101st Airborne Division of the United States Army, the Little Rock Nine claimed the fair and equal education that they were entitled to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It took close to a month to secure this access and opportunity, but these young men and women persevered in their mission of school integration. Defying Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus, segregationists and other protestors, the Little Rock Nine were victorious in ending segregated education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Little Rock Nine's first attempt to attend Central High School was on September 4, 1957; but the Arkansas Governor called in the National Guard of his State to keep them out. On September 23, the Little Rock Nine, armed with a Federal court order, again tried to attend Central High School, but protests and violence forced the group of students out of the school. It was not until Federal protection was provided that the students would be able to safely attend school on September 25. This Federal  protection would remain until the end of the school year, enabling African American senior Ernest Green to graduate. But, sadly, this year of progress would be tainted by the Arkansas Governor's decision to close all of the high schools the following year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Little Rock Nine would remain champions of education and school integration despite the fierce opposition. After the schools reopened in 1959, three more of the Little Rock Nine would go on to graduate from Central High. All of them would become productive, contributive members of our society. From social work to education to government, the Little Rock Nine were and remain represented in all professional sectors. They have also continued their commitment to education with the founding of  the Little Rock Nine Foundation, which is dedicated to providing educational opportunities to students of color.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the 50th anniversary of the integration of Central High by the Little Rock Nine, I am pleased to recognize that great progress has been made in education. But I must also acknowledge recent setbacks to the guarantee of opportunity and inclusion within our educational system. A recent Supreme Court decision now severely limits school districts in their efforts to achieve racial balance and diversity in primary and secondary education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in acknowledging recent setbacks, I would be remiss to not comment on the Jena Six. Just as the Little Rock Nine stood up to the inequities of their time, we must lift up the Jena Six in response to the inequities of their time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Little Rock Nine did not mean to make national or world history; they were just standing up for what they believed was right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In considering this resolution, I ask that all of our Members move forward with this same kind of determination and understanding of what our democracy is all about. On this 50th anniversary, let us all pledge to continue the legacy of the Little Rock Nine and Brown v. The Board by protecting and advancing equal educational opportunity for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I omit the great work that was done by President Dwight Eisenhower and others that helped move this situation forward some 50 years ago. And I note also that Arkansas was not a hot bed of segregation. It was considered, frankly, a moderate Southern State. But things transpired so that it became that one activity in which these nine boys and girls have gone into American history. They have been celebrated, and they have been talked about. I have been hearing about them all week long as we prepare  for this celebration. And I am so proud to bring this resolution on the 50th anniversary of the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School before this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 668, commemorating the Little Rock Nine, the African American students who enrolled in Little Rock Central High School in 1957 and were initially prevented from entering that segregated school. I want to commend Chairman Conyers for  bringing this legislation forward and our ranking member, Congressman Smith, for his support of it as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Dwight Eisenhower, following the landmark Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, sent Federal troops to enforce integration and protect the Little Rock Nine. On September 24, 1957, the President ordered the Army to Little Rock, and the nine students entered the school the next day. Thereafter, each of the students was given an individual escort inside Central High School to prevent them from harassment by other students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was surely a sad day when the Federal Government had to use the most powerful military in the world to integrate one high school in Little Rock, Arkansas. But it was also a proud day as well, as it demonstrated how our Constitution and each branch of government had, since the Civil War, finally had been honed and fitted to fulfill the promise of racial equality in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Conyers has already listed the Little Rock Nine, but the efforts of which they themselves and their families must be most proud are deserving of mentioning them again: Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Jefferson Thomas, Terrence Roberts, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Minnijean Brown, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed, and Melba Pattillo Beals. With each step they took through the schoolhouse doors, they paved a path forward for countless other African Americans. And when the school  bell rang that day, it marked not only the start of the school day; it rang for liberty and equality as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Little Rock Nine were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal on November 9, 1999. This resolution renews our commemoration of their courageous actions of the 50th anniversary of their historic first steps into history. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased now to recognize the distinguished gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Ross), who has been serving in the Congress for a period of years and we have enjoyed a very good working relationship with him. I yield him such time as he may consume.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 668, a resolution honoring and recognizing the 50th anniversary of the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School by the Little Rock Nine. First, I would like to thank Chairman Conyers for his support and leadership in moving this resolution from the Judiciary Committee to the floor of the United States House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution, which honors the anniversary of the nine students who gained national attention 50 years ago when Little Rock Central High School was integrated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Little Rock Central High School found itself in the spotlight of the entire Nation on September 25, 1957, when nine students escorted by the 101st Airborne Division of the U.S. Army walked up the front steps and integrated the school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The names of these nine individuals are barely recognizable alone, but collectively as the Little Rock Nine they gained national attention for their strength and unified determination to make our public schools a place where everyone can learn regardless of race.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This resolution honors their courage by commemorating the 50th anniversary of desegregation of Little Rock Central High School and encourages all Americans to recognize the historic contributions of the Little Rock Nine, who not only secured integration for Little Rock Central High School, but for hundreds of thousands of schools across our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tomorrow marks the 50th anniversary of this historic event, and I'm also proud to be taking part in the celebration of this civil rights achievement through the dedication of a permanent Little Rock Central High School Museum and Visitors Center. I'll be joined tomorrow by many of my colleagues, including the Arkansas congressional delegation, Congressmen JOHN BOOZMAN, MARION BERRY and VIC SNYDER.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Little Rock Nine have been acknowledged with numerous awards and recognitions, including the 2007 Little Rock Central High School desegregation 50th anniversary commemorative coin, one of only two such coins that are done annually. And I want to thank my good friend from Arkansas, Congressman VIC SNYDER for leading the effort in securing this as one of the two coins for this year. They've also been recognized for the Congressional Gold Medal. That was back in 1999. This resolution  adds one more recognition to this important group of individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we memorialize their legacies of bravery so that future generations of Americans will forever know their struggle, we can never forget the sacrifices endured by these nine individuals for the sake of progress on behalf of millions. The Little Rock Nine are symbolic of the victorious dismantling of school segregation, and as such, I am proud to cosponsor this resolution honoring their contributions, and I urge my fellow colleagues to vote in favor of it today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased now to recognize the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. DANNY DAVIS, who, himself, grew up in Arkansas. He was a distinguished alderman in Chicago before becoming a Member of Congress. He has worked with the Judiciary Committee with particular interest on re-entry programs, and he also happens to represent my counsel, Kanya Bennett, who comes to the floor with me today. I yield the gentleman as much time as he may consume.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Conyers for, not only his leadership on this issue, but so many issues involving civil rights down through the years and for bringing this legislation to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court announced its decision in Brown vs. Board of Education, holding that the segregation in public schools was illegal. Three years later, nine black students entered Little Rock Central High: Carlotta Walls, Jefferson Thomas, Elizabeth Eckford, Thelma Mothershed, Melba Pattillo, Terrance Roberts, Gloria Ray, Minniejean Brown and Ernest Green. I feel a certain amount of kinship to these nine students because, at that very same time, I was a freshman in college,  just 50 miles away at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. And so over the years, I had an opportunity to interact with several of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, the most well known is Ernest Green, who became an assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Labor and is now the managing director of Lehman Brothers investment firm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minniejean Brown, I spent a weekend with, down at Southern Illinois University, where she graduated just a few years ago when we were both there for some activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did student teaching with Melba Pattillo's mother, Mrs. Pattillo, who was a teacher in North Little Rock, Arkansas when I did student teaching.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so it's been a great move. It's hard to imagine that 50 years ago I was there, but I guess I was, JOHN. It's been a long time, but much has happened since then.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I simply want to congratulate Governor Beebe, the Mayor of Little Rock, all of the elected officials in Little Rock, for the tremendous display of commemoration and celebration that has taken place over these 3 days as they commemorate the tremendous movement. And I agree with Chairman Conyers in suggesting that not only has Little Rock, but the country has come a long way since 1957. We've made tremendous progress, even though there is much further to go.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400154" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. If the gentleman is prepared to close, I will yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself just a minute to close to observe that Arkansas, I have always connected with the former Governor of that State, the former President of this country, Bill Clinton. And I understand he's going to be there tomorrow to cut the ribbon, and I only wish that all of us who will be supporting and voting for this resolution could be there with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think Arkansas has come a long way. They've made a lot of progress, and we're all working to make this a  color-free society, where the content of one's character is far more important and significant than the color of one's skin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge support for Resolution 668 and yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we commemorate the 50th anniversary of school desegregation in Arkansas and celebrate nine brave young people and the families that supported them, it is a day of bittersweet reflection because the dreams they sought to fulfill for generations of African Americans remain still not fully realized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, as in 1957, we believe that education will help African Americans to get better jobs and to gain influence in American society. But, 50 years later, the struggle is not over. While in 1957, African American students struggled to get into high schools, today they struggle to stay in school. In describing the current state of education for African Americans, an author stated "burdened with a history that includes the denial of education, separate and unequal education, and religion to unsafe,  substandard inner-city schools, the quest for quality education remains an elusive dream for the African American community." The current drop out rate among African American males is estimated at 40 percent, 72 percent are jobless, and the likelihood of being incarcerated is 60 percent. Fifty years later, the playing field is not leveled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="668">H. Res. 668</bill>, not only recognizes the 50th anniversary of that momentous occasion on September 25, 1957, but it also calls for all to commit to continuing the legacy of Brown v. Board of Education and the Little Rock Nine by protecting and advancing equal educational opportunity for all. This would be a great way to honor and continue to pay tribute to heroic actions of the Little Rock Nine. Little Rock Nine opened the door for education but we must continue to close the gap in providing quality  education for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to join us in honoring the people who made history on that day, and to also join them and us in working toward the day when there will truly be equal opportunity in education in every part of our Nation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400040" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on September 25th, our State--and our Nation--will recognize nine brave men and women who, when they were teenagers, came forward to claim their Constitutional right to an equal education despite protests, threats of violence and even the Arkansas National Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly Support this legislation which honors not only a red-letter date in our State's history, but a seminal event in the movement to unite our country as truly one people, indivisible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifty years ago, Minnijean Brown, Elizabeth Eckford, Ernest Green, Thelma Mothershed, Melba Pattillo, Gloria Ray, Terrence Roberts, Jefferson Thomas, and Carlotta Walls, climbed the steps of Central High School. Few other moments in our history can compare to the ascent made by the Little Rock Nine. It was an ascent to a new plateau in the relations of Americans to their fellow citizens and a new plateau on the path to the American we now know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 25, 1957, when the Nine made it to the top of those Central High School steps, they stood in a place where, up till that point, others said they could not go. Then, they did what was, in fact, the most important thing that day: They went inside to learn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Central High School will always be the event at the forefront of our memories when it comes to the history of desegregation, it is my hope that, as we remember the Nine, we can also remember the other schools in our State which preceded them, including Fayetteville, Hoxie, and the community of Charleston--who first broke down the barrier in Arkansas on August 23, 1954.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to remember the names of Joe Ferguson, Jessie Ferguson, Mary Ferguson, Barbara Williams, Robert Williams, Etholia Williams, Time Freeman, Betty Freeman, Myrdle Freeman, Leroy Jones, Raymond Webb, Duty Webb, and Henry Web, who joined their fellow residents of Charleston to bring about peaceful change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we spend this day reflecting on our past, we should remember all the brave children, families, and educators across the state who--by their courage--set in motion a chain of events which created the Arkansas of the present and will resonate in the Arkansas of the future.</paragraph>
