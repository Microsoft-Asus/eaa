    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the men and women throughout my home State of New Mexico who provide lifesaving emergency medical services, EMS, and to commemorate EMS Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During my time in the Senate, I have come to understand the necessity of a highly trained EMS team. Such teams provide lifesaving care to those who are in need, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An important example of such care is provided to the people of Northern Rio Arriba County by the highly dedicated members of La Clinica EMS, which consists of:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joseph Baca, Paramedic; Phyllis Richards, Paramedic; Wenona Garcia, EMT-1; Rose Rash, EMT-1; Sarah Johnson, EMT-1; Paul Lisco, EMT-1; J.R. Gallegos, EMT-B; James Holiday, EMT-B; Tomas Casados, EMT-B; Stella Martinez, EMT-B; Kathy Morrison, EMT-B; Dave Morrison, EMT-B; Laurel Baker, EMT-B; Ramona Hays, EMT-B; Michael Hays, EMT-B; Emery Baca, EMT-B; B.J. Samora, FR; Josie Maestas, FR; and Marty Madrid, FR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to join the citizens of New Mexico in expressing my sincere gratitude to EMS professionals and their unwavering dedication to the community.</paragraph>
