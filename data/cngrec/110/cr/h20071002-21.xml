  <narrative>DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS PASSES BILL THAT FORCES BUSH ADMINISTRATION TO PLAN FOR REDEPLOYMENT -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11076]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. KLEIN of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412198" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when President Bush announced that he was keeping the troop escalation plan in effect until next summer, it was clear that he had no plan for ending the war in Iraq. In fact, the administration admits that they see our troops remaining in Iraq for at least 10 more years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush continues with the status quo in Iraq even though the Iraqi Government is not fulfilling its promise to meet the political benchmarks that were outlined by President Bush himself earlier this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Democrats are not going to tolerate another decade of our troops serving as referees in a civil war. And while this Congress cannot force the President to change course in Iraq until some of our Republican colleagues break ranks with the administration, I think that they even see the value in forcing this administration to finally come up with an exit strategy that is strategic in purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today the House will vote on legislation that would require the President and his administration to develop and submit a comprehensive redeployment strategy within the next 60 days. This war cannot go on indefinitely, and this administration needs to begin preparing for the day that we can finally bring our troops home.</paragraph>
