  <speaking speaker="300030" topic="TO THE CHARLES F. KETTERING MUSEUM">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in 1916, history records a number of momentous events, events that changed the course of our world. President Woodrow Wilson was elected to a second term. World War I was ramping up: Germany and Austria declared war on Portugal in March; Romania declared war on Austria in August; Italy declared war on Germany that same month; and Germany, Turkey, and Bulgaria declared war on Romania. Pancho Villa invaded New Mexico, and the United States responded by sending troops  under General John J. Pershing into Mexico. It is said that total miles of U.S. railroad trackage reached its historic peak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That same year, something equally revolutionary occurred that contributed to a significant change in the way farming was done in Idaho. In the fall of 1916, inventor, philosopher and engineer Charles F. Kettering from Centerville, OH, designed a self-starter for the Massey-Harris tractor. He did this for Thomas Lyon Hamer, a fellow Ohioan, so that Hamer's nephew, Thomas Ray Hamer, could operate the tractor and farm his land in St. Anthony, Idaho, without the well-known danger posed by the hand-crank.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thomas Ray Hamer, a Representative in Idaho's state legislature in 1896, was an attorney and a farmer. He also served in the military, in the First Regiment, Idaho Volunteer Infantry and as a captain and lieutenant colonel in the Philippines. He also served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands. During World War I, he served as a judge advocate general. He spent his later years practicing law in St. Anthony and Boise, ID, and Portland, OR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to recognize Charles F. Kettering's significant contribution to Idaho history and Idaho agriculture. Were it not for Kettering's willingness to help a friend and his creative ingenuity, a great Idahoan may not have gone on to a second successful military career and secured his place in Idaho history. Charles Kettering--at his death, coholder of more than 140 patents and possessing honorary doctorates from nearly 30 universities lived by his own words: "With willing  hands and open minds, the future will be greater than the most fantastic story you can write." Kettering's "willing hands" left their unmistakable handprint on the fields of my State of Idaho.</paragraph>
