    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a special group of Americans--the members of Company B, 7th Battalion, 158th Aviation Regiment. The dedication and patriotism of this Army Reserve unit from Olathe, KS, truly makes all Kansans and Americans proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In October 2005, Pakistan suffered a severe disaster when a 7.6-magnitude earthquake devastated the country. This unit, known as the Spartans, was in the midst of training at Fort Sill, OK, to prepare for its deployment to Afghanistan when they received orders to assist in the humanitarian relief efforts. The unit immediately responded by disassembling their entire fleet of Chinook helicopters, flying to Afghanistan where they reassembled their aircraft, and then deploying to Islamabad to participate  in relief efforts. All this was accomplished in a mere 4 days--a phenomenal feat. During the 5 months of this operation, the Spartans flew 2,633 missions where they delivered more than 18 million pounds of supplies, transported almost 7,000 refugees, and medically evacuated 311 casualties. This mission proved to be the longest and largest helicopter relief mission in the history of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following their relief mission, the unit deployed to Afghanistan to provide heavy-lift support for combat operations at Kandahar Airfield in southern Afghanistan. During their 7-month  deployment, the unit contributed to three major offensive operations by transporting troops and supplies in some of the most difficult conditions for aviation operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In early October 2006, the unit returned to Pakistan for Operation Promise Keeping, a mission to commemorate the 1-year anniversary of the earthquake. The unit delivered more than 87 tons of steel sheets, cement, and construction materials to help with rebuilding efforts in Pakistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This weekend, at the Army Aviation Association of America's annual convention, the unit is being recognized as the Army Reserve Aviation Unit of the Year. The Pakistani people will forever remember the servant hearts of these military members. It is with an overwhelming sense of gratitude that I wish to recognize these fine service members and their families for their dedication to the cause of freedom and congratulate them on their much deserved award.</paragraph>
