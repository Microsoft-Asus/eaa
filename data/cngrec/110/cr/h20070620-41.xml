    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House <bill type="h" number="2764">H.R. 2764</bill>, the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Department of State, foreign operations and related programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm particularly pleased that the appropriations bill that I bring to the floor as chairwoman of the State Foreign Operations Subcommittee reflects a bipartisan process, and that the ranking member, FRANK WOLF, was instrumental in pulling this bill together, as well as a very talented and engaged subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm very proud of our product. The bill before you totals $34.243 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $2.9 billion above fiscal year 2007, not counting supplemental appropriations, and $700 million below the President's request. This is the largest increase over the prior year enacted level that this subcommittee has received in over a decade. I appreciate Chairman Obey's recognition of the importance of this bill and the programs it funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill includes over $7 billion to address our strategic priorities and national security interests, as well as increases for programs that promote development and reduce low global poverty, meet humanitarian needs, and respond to urgent health crises, priorities at the core of our interests abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the war on terror, this bill includes $2.656 billion in economic assistance for our strategic partners and $4.509 billion in military assistance. While the bill includes $1.057 billion for Afghanistan, there are no additional funds for Iraq. In light of the $2.86 billion provided for Iraq reconstruction in the recently passed supplemental appropriations bill, and the $2.89 billion requested by the administration in the 2008 supplemental, I feel extremely strongly that there is no need at  this time for additional funds for the same purposes in this bill, given the extraordinary needs to be met around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill includes over $4.7 billion to support State Department operations, both in the United States and abroad. The recommendation fully funds the President's request for worldwide security upgrades, and provides $364 million for public diplomacy efforts at the State Department, as well as $501 million for educational and cultural exchanges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also provides $6.517 billion for global health. Addressing tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and other health threats is one of the best preventive measures to protect the health of the United States. We provide $5.082 billion for international HIV/AIDS efforts, which, in addition to appropriations in other bills, brings the total for international HIV/AIDS to $5.876 billion. This is $550 million above the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request, and includes $850 million for the  global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also includes $1.73 billion for development programs managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, an increase of $225 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. The increased resources will fund an initiative on basic education for developing countries, as well as an expansion of safe water and environment programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of you know, basic education has been one of my top priorities for years and, I'm pleased to say, a top priority of the members of this committee. I'm convinced that access to quality primary education not only improves an individual's chances for a better, more productive life, it creates a more tolerant and informed citizenry. I've provided a total of $750 million for basic education in the bill, an increase of $200 million from the fiscal year 2007 House-passed bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also provides $501 million for the environment and clean energy programs, including $106 million for the global environmental facility, and $175 million for biodiversity programs at USAID. We've also included a provision that encourages the Export-Import Bank to support projects in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is $1.8 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account. This is a $1.2 billion reduction from the request, but $48 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. I'm supportive of the MCA. I want to make this very clear. And while I believe the MCA is under the strong and capable management of Ambassador Danilovich, I would like to see more results on the ground from the $6 billion that has already been appropriated, $2.1 billion of which is not yet even obligated, before we significantly  scale-up the MCA. The reduction to MCA helps us address the shortfalls for development assistance and health accounts. We have also funded a basic education initiative as well as expansion of safe water and environmental programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With an investment of over $5 billion in the 6 years that Plan Colombia has been in effect, the numbers of hectares involved in coca production has increased by 42 percent. Because our efforts to combat narcotics in Colombia have been ineffective for some time, this bill restructures assistance for Colombia. We cut overall funding by 10 percent, or $59 million, and shift greater resources to the development, interdiction, rule of law and justice programs. It is time for the Colombians to take  ownership over their eradication and military assistance programs, and this cut reflects that position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill provides over $5.4 billion for Africa, including a total of $949.3 million for Sudan, $210.5 million of which is for Darfur, $104 million above the request. We have provided $100 million in increased funding for the African Union Force in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill allows us to fully meet the President's request for Israel and Egypt. And I want to make it clear that Egypt is a friend, an important ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace in the Middle East. However, there are growing concerns about the independence of its judiciary, police abuses, and the smuggling operation from Egypt into Gaza. As a result, this bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that steps are being taken to address these issues before a portion of the  military aid to Egypt can be released.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, as you know, U.S. Government assistance for family planning is prohibited for groups that provide, promote, refer or counsel on abortions. Groups that merely exercise their legal rights to advocate for policies such as the legalization of abortion are denied U.S. assistance. This bill provides an exemption to those restrictions simply for the provision of contraceptive commodities. Foreign family planning organizations, which have been denied USAID family planning funds, could receive  contraceptives from USAID to help reduce unintended and high-risk pregnancies, abortions and the spread of HIV, as well as save the lives of mothers and infants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision does not amend any of the provisions in existing law that prohibit assistance for abortions or otherwise restrict family planning funds.  They're all there; 10 of them are all there; and 5 for restricting family planning; 10 to be sure that there's no money for abortion, and 5 to restrict family planning. All there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this package of foreign assistance before you preserves our Nation's interests, reflects the values and priorities of the American people, and most importantly, helps to protect the security of Americans at home and abroad. It was developed in a bipartisan manner, and I expect it to have wide support as it passes the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, let me say again that it has been a pleasure working with Ranking Member Wolf and the minority staff, Christine Kojac, Rob Blair, Mike Ringler, Alice Hogans and Molly Miller. I would like to thank my vice chair, Jesse Jackson, Jr. for his hard work on this bill. I greatly appreciate the outstanding work and support of Nisha Desai, Lucy Heenan, Craig Higgins, Steve Marchese, Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes and Celia Alvarado. They're all competent, professional and really  a joy to work with. The work we have accomplished together in this bill will help make America more secure and will improve the lives of millions throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to submit this bill, and urge your favorable consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400435" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me start by commending the chairwoman on putting together a thoughtful bill, her first as the chairwoman of this new and important subcommittee. I must also recognize the chairwoman's continuation of this subcommittee's bipartisan tradition, as well as stating how much I appreciate the chairwoman's willingness to listen to our concerns and accommodate them as much as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Overall, I think it is a very good bill, but I do have some concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First and foremost, I believe this bill sends a terrible message to the State Department's officers and foreign service nationals and our military fighting in Iraq. The report accompanying the bill clearly states that there is no funding provided for Iraq. I intend to offer an amendment to restore $158 million of the $391 million that the President requested. I believe that not providing the requested funding for counterterrorism and de-mining activities is shortsighted and potentially dangerous.  This program has trained more than 1,000 Iraqis in explosive detection and removal, therefore helping to protect the lives of our military and also improving public safety to reduce insurgent access to deadly munitions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No funds are provided to develop effective civilian law enforcement and anti-terrorism programs in Iraq, specifically to focus on strengthening terrorist financing and money laundering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No funds are provided to continue English language training and professional training for military officers in the United States. This training focuses on international human rights, fostering respect for civilian control of the military and the rule of law. Such funding is crucial if public statements by Members about wanting Iraqis to be able to defend themselves are, in fact, accurate and not purely rhetorical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, this fits into the recommendations made by the Iraq Study Group, and when the resolution came up a while back that the other side had, I think 220-some Members said they supported the Iraq Study Group.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, no funding is provided to help Iraq manage their national budget, a crucial step towards Iraq self-reliance. No funding is included to enable Iraq to stimulate local economies to counter the impact of the insurgents. Assistance was requested and denied that would help Iraq create jobs in the agriculture sector and create food production, thereby stimulating Iraq's second largest economic sector after the oil area. These funds would directly weaken the insurgent base in rural areas, which  we all on both sides want to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, no funding is included to help national reconciliation, political reform, and fair provincial elections in 2008 and fair national elections in 2009. Additional funding was requested to develop the Iraqi criminal justice system. These necessary funds would allow the Iraqi government to identify, bring to justice, and incarcerate insurgents and terrorists who are trying to destabilize the country. So, hopefully, we can adopt that amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second issue of concern for me is there are new provisions regarding funding for family planning programs overseas. The President clearly stated in a May 3, 2007, letter to the Speaker of the House that he would veto any legislation that weakens current Federal policies and laws on abortion. As a result of these language changes alone, I believe the bill will now be vetoed, which is unfortunate because there are so many good things in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirdly, the bill does not include any funding to support the recommendations by Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba. The Castro regime is the only nondemocratically elected government in the Western Hemisphere. So now is the time to demonstrate a commitment to the future of freedom for Cuba and to fund the programs that will facilitate peaceful democratic transition. And, again, this has nothing to do with the whole trade issue that this place talks about or the whole travel issue. This  is to help the democratic movement in Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, I believe this bill has the potential to do a lot of good, and I want to say that this bill will help save a lot of lives not only here but around the world. This is the work of the Lord. And I know Members are going to come down and are going to be against the bill. And I hope that we can change some of these things to prevent a veto, but this bill, eventually when it passes, assuming it will be vetoed, is really to feed the poor, the hungry, the naked, the sick. Almost a better  title would be a Matthew 25 bill. So it has the potential to do a lot of good, and I hope to work with Chairwoman Lowey to ensure the State Department has what it needs to do these things, the war on terror, to provide humanitarian assistance to the most needy, and to improve human rights around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And Members on our side are offering amendments with regard to cutting. This is actually under the allocation with regard to the administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with the chairwoman to resolve the differences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank Nisha Desai, Craig Higgins, Steve Markes, Michel Sumilas, Celia, Rob, and also Christine, who were too embarrassed to put their names down. I wanted to put them down too. And I also want to thank the full committee staff on both sides, who have been very helpful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to our distinguished vice chairman, a very hardworking member of our subcommittee, my partner in this effort, Mr. Jackson of Illinois.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400198" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to voice my strong support for <bill type="h" number="2764">H.R. 2764</bill>, The State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs Appropriations bill. I can think of few things we do on an annual basis that are more important and crucial to the success of U.S. foreign policy than passing this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would be remiss if I did not begin my comments by thanking the chairwoman, Congresswoman NITA LOWEY, the first woman to chair this subcommittee and, in a very short time already, its most extraordinary chairman. I also want to thank Ranking Member Wolf and the majority and minority subcommittee staff for helping to produce a great bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the fact that the allocation for this bill is $700 million below the President's request, this is a well-written, well-measured bill, taking into account the concerns of both the majority and the minority. However, I am worried about the amendments I have seen that want to cut some of the vital programs in this bill in the name of fiscal discipline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am worried, Mr. Chairman, because yesterday around the world nearly 15,000 to 20,000 people died of extreme poverty. Today around the world 15,000 to 20,000 people will die of extreme poverty. Tomorrow around the world 15,000 to 20,000 people will die of extreme poverty. Extreme poverty like malnutrition and disease are claiming tens of thousands of lives every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has a real opportunity to reverse these facts. Look at what has been done to date with our foreign aid bill. Smallpox eradication began in the 1960s; control of river blindness in the 1970s; increased child immunizations in the 1980s; initiatives to fight Guinea worm, trachoma, and leprosy in the 1990s; and the effort to end polio in this decade. Measurable results produced with the dollars in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me point out some of the highlights of this measure. This bill before us today makes significant improvements in our aid package to Colombia, especially for Afro-Colombians, by emphasizing alternative development and rule of law, programs that work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, Mr. Chairman, provides increases for both our multilateral and bilateral peacekeeping obligations. These funds will provide security for trouble spots like the Darfur region of Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides increases for global health programs that fight the scourge of HIV, TB, and malaria. This bill provides increases for development assistance programs. Some of these funds are educating children and providing clean drinking water and sanitation around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The increases in this bill are the least we can do. I don't understand why some Members plan to offer amendments that cut some of the increases in  key development programs, tearing apart the majority party as tax and spenders. Our former colleague from Illinois, my friend John Porter, used the term "noblesse oblige," the belief that the wealthy and the privileged are obliged to help those who are less fortunate. In Luke chapter 12, verse 48, Jesus  simply says, "To whom much is given, much is expected." In Matthew chapter 6, verse 21, Jesus said, "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." If this verse is true, what does it say about these amendments that want to cut these crucial programs that are improving</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1984, referring to Marxist-ruled Ethiopia, President Ronald Reagan said, "A hungry child knows no politics." All he knows is that he is hungry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote for <bill type="h" number="2764">H.R. 2764</bill>, the State, Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. I hope that Democrats and Republicans will rally behind an extraordinary product created by the chairman of this committee, the ranking member of this committee, and the extraordinary Foreign Operations staff.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400435" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Before I yield to Mr. Lewis, I want to comment on the gentleman's remarks. I wouldn't question what his interpretation is, but in Luke it says "To whom much is given, much is required." Some versions say "expected," but it is actually a requirement, and we know a requirement in college, you have to do it to pass. So I think the authentic version says "To whom much is given, much is required." But I see it makes the gentleman's statement much more powerful, and I appreciate  the reference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the former chairman and the ranking member, who has been very generous and very interested in this subcommittee's work, Mr. Lewis.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400239" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Wolf and Madam Chairman, I can't tell you how much I respect the work that the two of you have done together, and to join on the floor with my friend JESSIE JACKSON in expressing support for this bill, indeed, is a privilege.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to rise today to support <bill type="h" number="2764">H.R. 2764</bill>, the State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs Appropriations bill for the fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to express my appreciation for the work of Mrs. Lowey as well as Mr. Wolf. They are a demonstration project of what we can do when we set partisanship aside and work together on behalf of really our responsibility to lead in this world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which Congress reviews the U.S. international affairs budget and influences our foreign policy. It provides a total of $34.243 billion including $10.76 billion for State Department operations, international broadcasting, and related agencies, and $23.62 billion for foreign assistance programs. The total is $2.95 billion over last year's level and $700 million less than the President's request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill addresses critical issues such as the AIDS pandemic, Child Survival and Health programs, anti-narcotics programs, and our efforts in the global war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it is important that we realize what a critical role this bill plays in the well-being of the world and the security of our Nation. The United States is the last remaining superpower and the sole voice of freedom and democracy around the world. What we do in this bill saves the lives of countless numbers of people in nations that are less fortunate than ours. These funds stabilize fragile democracies around the globe and help our allies in the global war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I know most Members feel they weren't elected to support international assistance programs. In fact, Mr. Chairman, I am sure there are many Members who feel that the United States should dramatically reduce the amount of money we spend around the world and focus our resources on domestic priorities. This sort of isolationist point of view has no place in today's shrinking world. One needs only to look to Europe as an example of a once powerful and influential nation withdrew its resources  from around the world and focused inward. What has since been termed as the "French model" resulted in massive inflation, high unemployment rates within the country, and severe internal crises. The United States should not follow the "French model," a misguided path that essentially has caused the French to disappear as a powerful force in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I remember as a young man attending UCLA I was fortunate to participate in a program that preceded the Peace Corps called Project India. As I joined other young students in traveling to villages around a country where poverty and ever-present caste systems were always visible, I was struck by the importance that personal freedom and opportunity have on the human condition, especially if you had the good fortune of being born in the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, India has outlawed the caste system and is the largest democracy in the world, as well as our strong ally in the global war on terror. I am particularly pleased that in any congressional district there are large numbers of my constituents who are actively involved, advocating for increases in our international assistance program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent meetings with the Results Group, with CARE, Bread for the World and others, I have noticed that more and more people are beginning to understand that they, too, have a role in our role for leadership in the world. Theirs are the voices from the grass roots, a perspective that we need as Americans to recognize that we must continue to lead in the world, for indeed, without our leadership, the poor of the world will suffer most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to support this fabulous demonstration of work on both sides of the aisle together.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California, a valuable member of our subcommittee, who has focused his intellect on nuclear nonproliferation, on counterterrorism and on demining and I look forward to working together for many years on this committee (Mr. Schiff).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400361" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I want to begin by commending Chairwoman Lowey for her extraordinary work on this bill and the really exemplary way that she has chaired this committee. I also want to commend our ranking member, Mr. Wolf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Chair and ranking member have crafted a bill that I think reflects the bipartisan approach to America's engagement in the world that we should have. It supports a view that I share that a healthier, better educated and more secure developing world means a safer world for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After several years where diplomacy was marginalized and the men and women of the State Department were relegated to junior-partner status in the national security policymaking apparatus, this committee is moving our policy towards a new primacy for diplomacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is important to our efforts to fight terrorism, foster peaceful diplomacy, and improve the quality of life for millions of the world's most vulnerable citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill recognizes the inextricable ties between development and security. It is mindful of the fact that we are ultimately locked in a struggle for hearts and minds and that an excessive reliance on military force as the primary lever of American policy can be counterproductive, and that terrorists often seek to draw an American military response and may be strengthened by it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to point to two provisions that I think have broad implications for the global environment and the quest to stem the proliferation of small arms and light weapons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill supports innovative new approaches to fostering renewable energy that Steve Israel and I have advocated by including a provision to encourage the Export-Import Bank to seek out investments in renewable energy and other environmentally beneficial products. This initiative could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional green exports in 2008 and will encourage the  use of renewable energy worldwide while helping the U.S. producers of renewable  energy and green products. This is a step forward in our competitiveness and a step forward for the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also includes language that supports the Small Arms/Light Weapons destruction program, a State Department initiative to destroy grenades, guns and man-portable air defense systems that might otherwise fall into hostile hands. By funding this important program, we have increased our commitment to countering the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, weapons that could end up in the hands of terrorists, criminals and human rights-abusing governments around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the chair and ranking member for their extraordinary efforts.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400225" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding. I appreciate the opportunity to speak this evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak to the importance of this bill and the many issues associated with U.S. foreign policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee for over 12 years, I commend first the new chairwoman, Mrs. LOWEY, as well as the new ranking member, Mr. Wolf, for putting together a good bill with the allocations that they received. But let me be clear. The chairwoman and the ranking member have done a commendable job crafting our foreign assistance policies, and I support most of this bill. However, there are a few provisions that are in strong contrast to my views.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First let me highlight the provisions I strongly support. The bill fully funds the administration's request for Israel and Egypt. Ten years ago, the U.S. entered into a proportional agreement with the two countries. This bill marks the last year of this agreement. I am pleased that Congress has met its obligations to these two important allies in the Middle East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee has also fully funded the Refugee Resettlement Program in Israel at $40 million. And further, this legislation almost doubles the President's request for Armenia. This funding is absolutely crucial as Armenia is still dealing with an illegal blockade by its neighbors, Turkey and Azerbaijan. Armenia's economy has suffered, but U.S. assistance has helped stymie the economic detriment of these blockades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration continues to deny Armenia adequate economic support in their request, and I commend the chairwoman again for seeing the importance of our ally, Armenia, and increasing economic funding for the country. Chairwoman Lowey has also continued military parity between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which sends a strong signal that the United States does not condone Azerbaijan's military threats towards Armenia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there are also a number of provisions and funding levels within this bill that trouble me. First among them is funding for the Millenium Challenge Account.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, Congress authorized a new and innovative program which fundamentally changed the way we view foreign assistance. The MCA provides assistance to developing nations that are pursuing political and economic reforms. Their motto, "reducing poverty through growth" speaks to the validity of the program. The MCA specifically awards compacts to countries that have shown improvement in eliminating corruption and investing in people and ruling justly, and fostering enterprise and entrepreneurship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before entering into a compact, the MCA and the eligible country work together to draft the parameters of the compact. Each compact is different because the needs of individual countries are different. For instance, the MCA and Armenia signed a compact that focuses on rural development and Armenia's agricultural industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this program also does is to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars are not wasted. Eligible countries are held accountable for how the money is spent as well as how their government is performing. I strongly believe that this program is the future of U.S. foreign assistance, where accountability and results are the top priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, however, underfunds the MCA by $1.2 billion. While I understand the subcommittee made every effort to accommodate funding given its allocation, funding the MCA at only $1.8 billion for fiscal year 2008 will stop the program in its tracks and slow the process of signing compacts with eligible countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year during the debate on the fiscal year 2007 Foreign Operations bill, the House approved $2 billion for the MCA. Now, a year later, the new majority has cut the MCA below the President's request and below the House-passed level for fiscal year 2007. This is no way to grow a program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, during the full committee markup of the bill, the chairwoman expressed her support for the MCA and her willingness to work with me to find more funding for the MCA through the process. I very much appreciate her support and look forward to continuing to work with her on what I believe is a very, very important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, Mr. Chairman, there are provisions within this bill that go against the fundamental value of life. The United States has a long history of supporting nongovernmental organizations and other groups that support abstinence and prevention but do not promote abortion. Current policy is fair and balanced and has worked for years. However, this bill, I believe, goes against the will of the U.S. citizens and allows NGOs that promote abortion to receive U.S. Federal assistance. I understand there  are going to be amendments to strike these provisions within this bill, and I intend to support these amendments. And although there are many things I support in this bill, if those amendments fail, I cannot support final passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would hope the majority would work with the President and the minority to ensure that core American values are upheld as the bill moves forward.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to a new member of the committee, a valuable addition, an expert on Africa and HIV/AIDS, Ms. Lee of California.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="LEE" of="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for yielding. But also let me just commend you, Chairman Lowey, for your brilliance, your leadership and your hard work in crafting this very good bipartisan bill. It is an honor to serve with you and our ranking member (Mr. Wolf) on the committee because I see how you two work together to make this a bill that we can all support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just highlight three provisions of this bill. First, I'm pleased that it includes $949 million for humanitarian assistance in the Sudan. Of this, $210 million is specifically designed to help the victims of the genocide in Darfur. Having traveled there three times, I have seen the plight of the Darfurian people firsthand. This bill will help the United Nations and the African Union to bring food, clean water, security, and other basic humanitarian assistance. It also urges our good friend  and ally, Egypt, to do more to help the genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, I am pleased that this bill includes nearly $5.1 billion to fight the global AIDS pandemic, including $550 million for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 25 years, HIV and AIDS has infected nearly 70 million people throughout the world and has killed more than 25 million. We have made significant steps in the last few years, and this increase reaffirms our commitment to stop the spread of this dreadful disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the bill moves ahead, however, I hope we can go even further. As the New York Times pointed out in a recent editorial on Monday, we must try to provide $1.3 billion to the global fund this year and help put the world on course to universal access to AIDS treatment by 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to insert the New York Times editorial into the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two Cheers on Global AIDS</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now that the Group of 8 industrialized nations has pledged to commit $60 billion to combat AIDS and other diseases around the world in coming years--a substantial sum by any reckoning--Congress and other national legislatures ought to look hard for additional funds to close a looming gap between the funds committed and the needs of desperate patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The advanced nations--both the G-8 countries and other donor nations--have greatly  increased their funding for AIDS programs in recent years in belated recognition that the epidemic threatens to destroy not just its victims, but also the social and economic fabric of many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We are pleased that President Bush has proposed spending some $30 billion to combat AIDS abroad over a five-year period, from 2009 to 2013, but in truth  that represents only a modest increase from the spending trajectory we were already on. At its recent summit meeting, the Group of 8 pledged to commit $60 billion to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria "over the coming years," including the American contribution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet even these pledges will not be enough to keep up with the devastating epidemics. Tens of billions of dollars more will be needed to provide treatment, care and preventive services for AIDS alone over the next five years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the Group of 8 pledges are welcome, they actually represent a retreat from previous goals. In 2005, at its meeting in Gleneagles, Scotland, the group pledged to provide "as close as possible to universal access to treatment" for all people suffering from AIDS by 2010. That should mean at least 10 million people in treatment by then, judging from estimates by United Nations AIDS experts. Yet at the recent meeting, the G-8 said it was aiming to treat only some five million patients in  Africa by an unspecified date. That sounds like consigning millions of untreated people to death and disability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To its credit, the United States has been by far the largest AIDS donor in recent years, providing almost half of the funding commitments made by donor governments. But when measured against the size of the national economy, the American donations rank only fifth. There is room to do more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Congress wrestles with the fiscal 2008 appropriations bills this year, it ought to provide the full $1.3 billion being sought by Congressional health advocates as the American contribution to a global fund to combat the three diseases--not just $300 mlilion as proposed by the administration or the $850 million approved by the House Appropriations Committee. Congress should also set the nation--and by its example, the world--on course toward universal access to AIDS treatment by 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, Mr. Chairman, also takes steps to recognize the importance of our Caribbean neighbors by urging the State Department to promote professional and scholastic exchanges within the region. This is a significant way to welcome the heads of the Caribbean countries, CARICOM, as they convene in Washington, D.C. this week to consider our common future as neighbors. This is a region which has been, for the most part, neglected and ignored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, Mr. Chairman, let me just say that this bill provides the correct path to global peace and security, and does take care of and address the least of these. However, I only wish the amount in this bill was more than just the 1 percent of the Federal budget, which is what this is. This is a $34 billion bill, but I wish, Mr. Chairman, that it was $340 billion.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400222" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I want to thank Mr. Wolf and our chairwoman for building a bipartisan bill that I think we all should support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation funds critical programs that advance our values overseas, it supports key allies of the United States, and it meets many of the humanitarian aspirations of the American people to do our part to relieve human suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a staffer, I helped found the global program on AIDS in 1985, and in this bill we have record funding to accomplish a great humanitarian mission of fighting the HIV/AIDS pandemic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this legislation, we support our best ally in the Middle East, Israel, now caught between two satellites of Iran: Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. In this bill, I helped sponsor language that increased the audit responsibilities over UNRWA programs in the West Bank and Gaza, a $2 million audit especially to look at incidents in which an al Qaeda cell was allowed to form in a UNRWA camp now bedeviling the Government of Lebanon, and where we saw Gaza Islamic University, a U.S.-funded  foreign assistance recipient who is running in its chemistry lab a cell of Iranian military officers training students in the chemistry of making suicide bombs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this bill, I also helped fund increasing assistance in the Frontier Autonomous Tribal area of Pakistan. This is a program of almost theologic importance to the people of the United States because it is in north and south Waziristan and surrounding areas, that we think the world's most wanted man, Osama bin Laden, is hiding. And with this $20 million assistance package, we will bring new links and new friends in this region to help complete the arrest and bringing to justice of Ayman Al-Zawahiri  and Osama bin Laden for the murder of 3,000 Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this bill we also preserved new funding in fiscal year 2007 to help Christian communities in Iraq. There are still 600,000 Christians in Iraq, now concentrating in the Nineveh plain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The $10 million designation we do there is a great help to these communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill makes a major forward step also in supporting a new democracy program for Syria, that one day that murderous and pernicious dictatorship may one day be replaced; and also backing women's rights programs in Iran, another country in need of a serious democracy make-over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, this bill continues funding for Radio Free Asia and a voice supporting Western values, democracy, and human rights in a critical part of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I was elected to Congress, I was a staff member with this subcommittee. I want to thank Christine Kojac and Rob Blair, Mike Ringler and Nisha Desai, Clelia Alvarado, Steve Marchese, Craig Higgins and Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes, Lucy Heenan, Molly Miller, and my staff member, Richard Goldberg, for their work on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In sum, this appropriations bill is bipartisan. It is supporting the interests of the United States, and it is strongly backed by our allies. It makes peace more likely and achieves important humanitarian goals of the United States.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to my good friend and colleague from New York, another new member of the subcommittee, who has had a particular interest and has great knowledge in the environment and made a major contribution to this bill in encouraging Ex-Im to focus on supporting projects that will contribute to the environment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400195" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank my distinguished chairwoman and my wonderful partner in the New York delegation for her wonderful leadership. I want to thank the ranking member, Mr. Wolf, for producing a bill that says to adversaries and allies alike that politics can stop at the water's edge here in the United States Congress, that when it comes to foreign policy, Republicans and Democrats work together and strive to work together because we understand that a strong, muscular, fair  foreign policy is in the best national security interests of our country, that where we can produce and facilitate stability and the conditions of peace, that we won't have to exert military force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the chairwoman and the ranking member for supporting three very specific provisions that I sought. One the chairwoman had mentioned, and that is asking the Export-Import Bank to dedicate part of their export authority to green exports, to renewable energy investments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ex-Im Bank has supported $400 billion of U.S. exports in the past 70 years. That is job creation here in the United States. It is the formation of capital that supports businesses right here. I support the Ex-Im Bank. But we are hoping that they will focus on new efforts to create green jobs, green manufacturing jobs to reduce global warming, which is a national security issue. And the provision that Congressman Schiff and I requested would require the Ex-Im Bank to dedicate some  of its export authority to those green technologies and could result in an estimated $1 billion in additional exports in 2008, encouraging the use of renewable energy worldwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second provision that I am very proud of concerns Libya and the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. It is a matter of fact that in 1988 Libyan-backed terrorists killed 270 people, including 189 Americans, by bombing Pan Am Flight 103. They made an agreement. They agreed to a settlement that would provide payment to those families. That settlement, those promises have not been kept. I am very proud of language that we added that says that the government of Libya, if it wants to be part of the international  community, if Libya wants to be part of the community of nations, they need to keep their  promises, and funds for diplomatic relations to Libya will not be expended unless those promises are kept.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kara Weipz, as the President of Victims of Pan Am Fight 103, said that they are deeply encouraged by this important step by Congress to hold Libya accountable before it is rewarded with diplomatic relations, and that this settlement represents a promise to the families, an acknowledgement of the victims, and some form of punishment to the perpetrators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairwoman and ranking member for their steadfast support against the genocide in Darfur. As we debate this bill tonight and tomorrow, a genocide is being perpetrated in our midst. We have said to other genocides, never again. This bill turns that statement into action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the gentlewoman and the gentleman for their commitment to make sure that never again means never again.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Weldon).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400427" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to commend Chairwoman Lowey for working diligently on this bill. She has produced a fairly good product here, and I want to commend her more for working with Mr. Wolf and myself to address many of our concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She has produced a bill that is good in many respects. I appreciate the efforts as well of the staff that have worked very hard on this bill. A great example of working together is what my colleague from New York, Mr. Israel, was talking about in dealing with Darfur. I want to commend Mr. Wolf for his passion on that issue and his passion for the issue of human rights throughout the globe. I also want to commend Ranking Member Wolf and Chairwoman Lowey for  their work on Colombia, and I am very pleased with the final product that they have there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also very pleased that we have included language dealing with better accountability for the Global Fund to provide greater transparency. I commend Chairwoman Lowey for including the language that I introduced, the amendment, to get a better understanding of why the participation of faith-based organizations in the Global Fund appears to be significantly underrepresented. Numerous faith-based groups have been on the ground providing health care in many of those these countries for  decades. In recent decades they have been on the frontlines in fighting against the spread of AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I saw the critical role that many of those faith-based groups provided firsthand when I visited Africa twice in recent years. I can tell you what part of the problem is, and it is really spelled out very nicely, and I will include for the Record this brief 3-page article from Catholic News Services, "African Churches Find Global Fund Money Fairly Inaccessible."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Basically, what I feel is going on here with those faith-based groups is relatively simple. They are small. They are out there. They are going into these villages on foot and on mopeds. They don't have the ability to apply for grants with multi-billion dollar organizations in Geneva. It is going to require the Global Fund to reach into these countries, identify the groups, the church groups, the faith-based groups, that are doing the work. Frequently, they are on the pointy end of the spear.  So I commend the gentlewoman for that language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know there are a few issues that we disagree on. The Mexico City policy language, we will have amendments to address that. Certainly, I understand that the gentlewoman has tried to reach out on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For me personally, the issue is an organization that is not only maybe providing abortion but as well is actually actively lobbying to overturn pro-life laws in many of those countries. We should not be supporting them even indirectly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, let me just close on the PEPFAR language. I played a role in getting the President's plan through the Congress, the authorizing language and the appropriations language. To me one of the most important things was the requirement that a portion, actually a small portion, I think it is 20, 25 percent of the preventive dollars go to abstinence education and abstinence training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make it very clear to my colleagues the reason why I felt so strongly about that and why I feel that we should continue the requirement that abstinence education be included in the preventive dollars is my experience in going into Uganda. Uganda lowered its AIDS incidence from 18 percent to 6 percent, a two-thirds reduction in AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Global Fund didn't exist. PEPFAR did not exist when they did this. They did not do this through distributing condoms and comprehensive sex education. They did it through what they called ABC, abstinence before marriage, be faithful in marriage. We all know, you can't expect everybody to comply. But what is amazing to me is when you educate people on this thousands of people comply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to share with my colleagues that I had a meeting just 2 weeks ago with a Parliamentarian from Uganda who was an epidemiologist and a physician who was there from the ground up, and he verified just what I said, that people responded to the message.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just finish up on that. Last July, southern African AIDS experts met and they officially listed "reducing multiple and concurrent partnerships" as their number one priority for the prevention of spreading HIV. It was not distributing condoms and comprehensive sex education, it was reducing concurrent and multiple partnerships. That is what this is really all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just close and again commend the gentlewoman for a bill that has a lot of good in it. I am focusing on some of the things I disagree with. But for everything I disagree with, there are 10 to 20 different things that are good in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The spending level, I am very concerned that the President may veto this bill. I know there are a lot of worthwhile programs covered in the spending. I certainly would like to see us get a bill enacted into law. I think that would be to the credit of the chairwoman and the ranking member, the good gentleman from Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>African Churches Find Global Fund Money Fairly Inaccessible</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NAIROBI, KENYA (CNS)--In Kenya churches provide about 40 percent of all health care in remote and impoverished areas with no government services, but for their AIDS programs, churches receive no money from The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Since the inception of the Global Fund, the Kenyan bishops' conference has not accessed any direct funding from the Global Fund, even after applying to all the rounds," said Titus Munene, an HIV/AIDS program coordinator for the Kenyan bishops' conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"It isn't rocket science to say if 40 percent of the health care is in the church system in Kenya, you would think a good portion of (Global Fund money) is going to go to our operational system. But unfortunately, it isn't that way," said Maryknoll Father Ed Phillips, who runs seven community-based health care clinics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Geneva-based Global Fund, established in 2002, is a partnership among governments, civil society, the private sector and affected communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Catholic Church alone provides more than 25 percent of all AIDS care in the world, according to Caritas Internationalis, the Catholic aid network. All faith-based organizations combined have received just 6 percent of the Global Fund's money since the first disbursements in 2002.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Southern African Catholic Bishops' Conference, which represents South Africa, Botswana and Swaziland, has almost stopped applying for Global Fund money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 18 percent of adult South Africans are HIV-positive, and the church is the largest health care provider after the government. But church bodies have been unable to access Global Fund money either directly or through the South African National AIDS Council, which coordinates South African applications to the Global Fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I have sat on SANAC, the South African National AIDS Council, which is also the CCM (country coordinating mechanism) for the Global Fund. It has not been a helpful process," Dominican Sister Alison Munro said in an e-mail from Pretoria, South Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The Global Fund process is too large and too cumbersome for the churches," said Sister Alison. "If they (the churches) could apply directly to the Global Fund, some would. They can't because of the procedures. ..... The work involved is too much for any church group other than a national structure or a group with lots of capacity."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While many nongovernmental organizations employ grant application experts, church-based agencies have tended to regard such functions as wasteful of donor money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Munene said when the churches do not get Global Fund money it weakens the fight against AIDS among some of the poorest Africans. A lack of international and Kenyan-government funding has forced mission hospitals, clinics and dispensaries to charge some of the poorest people in Kenya for AIDS treatment and services, while relatively well-off people in the cities are accessing free services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Munene said when church agencies charge for health care it "means some of the poor cannot access services, since there are no government facilities in those rural areas."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 6 percent of Global Fund money going to faith-based organizations translates into $325 million spread over five years in dozens of countries. The Global Fund recognizes the number is too low, said spokesman Oliver Sabot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Given the essential role that they play in health care in many countries, particularly in Africa, we would like to see the amount of funding to FBOs (faith-based organizations) increase," Sabot said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Part of the problem has been that churches have not done enough to fulfill conditions that might be expected from major international funders, such as making detailed applications for funding and monitoring expenditures to the satisfaction of donors, said Father Robert Vitillo of Caritas Internationalis, the Vatican's most prominent adviser on HIV/AIDS policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Each of these funding mechanisms comes with its own set of challenges for (faith-based organizations), which are more expert in providing support, care, treatment and prevention education than in completing such complicated funding applications and then in monitoring and reporting on the funds received," said Father Vitillo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even if it is a lot of red tape, church organizations have to be willing to fight through it in order to continue delivering effective AIDS prevention and care, said Father Phillips. But the Global Fund also has a responsibility to help churches through the red tape, he said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The churches have to get more proactive," said Father Phillips. Sabot said the Global Fund has taken steps to ensure that faith-based organizations are able to apply for money. But by relying on countries' coordinating agencies or mechanisms, the Global Fund has become subject to the politics of Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"This hands-off approach does mean that bias at the country level is sometimes reflected," said Sabot. He said sometimes faith-based groups are excluded from country proposals "either because of deliberate efforts by the government or other groups, or simply because they are less experienced with applying for international aid funding, and not enough outreach and support was provided to them" by country coordinating agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"We have taken steps to help correct both these problems, but there is still more to be done," Sabot said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Father Phillips said more than bureaucratic bias is involved in shutting churches out of national applications to the Global Fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The church was considered in some of these countries to be the opposition to the government," he said. "Naturally, if they are considered to be opposition, well, they're (government mechanisms) going to make sure they're not going to target a lot of money" for the church.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Father Phillips said African bishops must get tough and vocal about demanding that they be represented fairly in national applications to the Global Fund, but Munene said the churches may be talking to a brick wall when they demand fair representation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The Kenyan bishops have made frantic efforts to meet the minister of health on several occasions, and even his excellency, the president. And promises were given, but to date the pledges have not been fulfilled," Munene said.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Farr), a valuable member of the full committee, an alumnus of the Peace Corps and an advocate for so many parts of this bill. He was a real partner in helping us craft this great bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400129" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Madam Chairman, for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support and with a congratulatory note to Chairwoman NITA LOWEY for her bold leadership on this bill, and also to the ranking member, FRANK WOLf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly proud of the fact that the committee, for the first time in many, many years, fully funded the Peace Corps. As a returned Peace Corps volunteer, a volunteer that served in Colombia, I am also a strong supporter of that country and the programs we are doing there. I want to thank the committee for rebalancing the United States-Colombia policy in the Andean Initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe Colombia is a country of enormous potential. But Colombia's full potential as a democratic nation is not being realized because of its coca production. The Colombia that I know and loved as a Peace Corps volunteer is often not seen through the debate of the coca problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eighty percent of the U.S. assistance has been allocated on military assistance and aerial fumigation, yet 80 percent of rural Colombians still live below the poverty line. Let me say that again. Eighty percent of the rural Colombians still live below the poverty line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tragically, after 7 years and $4 billion-plus in U.S. assistance, it is overwhelmingly apparent that we must change our course in this country. Imagine if 80 percent of rural Americans lived below the poverty line. There would be riots in the streets, and every farmer would be growing coca in their backyards to feed their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Folks, we need to wake up and smell the coffee, preferably Colombian coffee. It is the poverty in Colombia that breeds the problems. Coca is a symptom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill realigns Colombia-U.S. assistance so that 45 percent is allocated to economic and alternative development, which enables campesinos to grow crops like coffee, tropical fruits and chocolate that command better market prices so they can feed their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why does this matter to you? Because stemming Colombia coca production stops the flow of drugs to Main Street USA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday in El Tiempo, a Colombian newspaper equivalent to the New York Times, in an editorial stated "Alternative development should stop being a little sister charity case to the antidrug strategy, and a substantial part of the assistance should go to rural development." This committee does that, and I commend them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope soon that the State Department will comply with U.S. policy and force contractors to reach benchmarks when they must transfer their counternarcotic programs to Colombians to run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must urge my colleagues to support the Foreign Operations bill. Help Colombia realize its potential to eliminate the root causes of the culture of poverty. Support these increased funds for economic and alternative development.</paragraph>
