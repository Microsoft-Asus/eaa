    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning there will be a brief period of morning business until 10:20, and then we will proceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Randy Smith, to be a U.S. Circuit Court Judge, and Marcia Morales Howard, to be a U.S. District Judge. Debate on these nominations is limited to a total of 10 minutes equally divided and controlled between the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. At 10:30, the Senate will proceed to vote on confirmation  of these two nominations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to indicate to Members that a third rollcall vote is likely shortly after these votes on the adjournment of the Senate, so Members should plan on three votes instead of two.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following these votes there will be morning business, with the first hour controlled by Senator Leahy and then the Republican leader or his designee will control an hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in a short time, we will approve the first circuit court judge of this Congress. The distinguished Republican leader and I have had conversations about having as little acrimony--in fact, hopefully none--on circuit court judges. The last Congress will be noted for a number of things and one will be the contentiousness of the circuit court judges that came before the Senate. I have made a commitment to my friend from Kentucky that we will move forward on these. We have had conversations  with the President, and he is going to do his best to send us circuit court judges that are not people who cause a lot of heartburn on this side, and we think that is totally possible and in keeping with the standards President Bush wants for these circuit court judges. So this is a time when we are going to try to work together to move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Randy Smith is the first, and I say to everyone, it wasn't easy to get him here. He has been nominated for one position and then another position. There was a little holdup to begin with, but we are beginning to work through this, as we wish to do. We have members of the Judiciary Committee who  understand this and the two managers of this committee, the chairman, Senator Leahy, and the ranking member, Senator Specter, know of our concern,  and that is the concern of Senator McConnell and myself, and we are going to do our very best to make sure this is not our last circuit court judge but the first of a significant number who can at least meet the standards of Congresses similarly situated as ours.</paragraph>
