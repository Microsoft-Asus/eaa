  <narrative>INDIAN HEALTH CARE -- (Senate - February 25, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1098">S1098</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in the month since this year's congressional session has opened, we have had the ability to focus on some of the domestic priorities our country faces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we turn to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Although we often have legitimate disagreements on matters of policy, Senator McConnell and members of the Republican Caucus have worked with us in a bipartisan manner on what we believe is a critical piece of legislation that does so much for the Native American community. I appreciate their efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Dorgan and Senator Murkowski deserve our thanks for their leadership and hard work in managing this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley followed suit, working on a bipartisan basis on provisions to improve the way by which the Indian health care system and tribal recipients can participate more fully in Social Security and the benefits that relate to health in Social Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senators KENNEDY, BINGAMAN, KYL, and ENZI spent years working on this legislation. Because of their efforts and those of countless tribal leaders and Federal agency staff, this is legislation that Democrats and Republicans can all support now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A final word of praise is due to the tribal advocates who stood behind this cause from the beginning: The National Congress of American Indians, the National Indian Health Board, the National Council of Urban Indian Health, the Indian Health Board of Nevada, and other State tribal organizations which have played crucial roles in this legislation. I say with confidence that this bill reflects their priorities, their varied interests, and their solutions to the problems that plague the health care  system upon which Native Americans rely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was glad to be an original cosponsor of this initiative. Over the past 8 years, my staff and I have had countless meetings with tribal leaders. Now tribal leaders are making clear how this legislation is needed all over the country. It is needed for 30,000 Native Americans living in Nevada and millions living throughout the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, our Native American communities have access to the least adequate health care in America. Far too many Native children are diagnosed with diabetes, suffer from abuse and neglect or die prematurely because of accidents or illness that could have been prevented or cured with basic health care. Far too many adult Indians get lost in a sea of bureaucracy and fail to receive preventive care and other health benefits they need and deserve. We can and must do better, and this legislative  initiative will help Federal and tribal health professionals deliver quality care to Native Americans of all ages. It supports the recruitment and retention of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other health professionals for Indian health programs. It strengthens and expands health services to American Indians. For the first time, tribes will be allowed to use Federal funds to provide hospice, long-term care and home-based and community-based care for elders and the most vulnerable tribal members. It increases individual</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Dorgan has often said America spends more on health care, per person, on Federal prisoners than on Native Americans. Senator Dorgan has said that many times. This bill is only part of the solution, but it is a critical first step. I urge all my colleagues to finish work and approve this bill in the same spirit of bipartisan cooperation it has seen from the beginning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Millions of our first Americans await our action. Let's quickly pass this bill and send it to the President for his signature. We must let our country's Native Americans know they are not forgotten and that we will deliver them the care they have earned.</paragraph>
