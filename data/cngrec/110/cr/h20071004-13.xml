    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have seen an incredible amount of political posturing this week over SCHIP. The SCHIP program was created in a bipartisan effort to ensure poor children without health insurance have health care coverage. Poor children without insurance. Children, not adults. Some States have more adults on SCHIP than children. Poor children, not families making $83,000 a year, to get free health insurance. Poor children without insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Democrat bill, one in three children who already have private insurance would drop their private coverage to get free government coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's ensure poor children have health coverage and do it in a bipartisan way, not shutting out Republicans the way they did in this last bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Democrat Congress truly is a dysfunctional Congress. They can't even get SCHIP reauthorization right.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
