  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge Dr. Shea Penland, one of the leading experts on coastal restoration, for his dedicated service to Louisiana. I would like to take some time to make a few remarks on his accomplishments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Penland passed away suddenly at the age of 54 on Tuesday, March 25, 2008. He was a respected professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of New Orleans and the director of the Pontchartrain Institute of Environmental Science. His investigations included the coastal regions of the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, the Great Lakes, the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and the North Sea. Dr. Penland had been an advocate for coastal protection and restoration in Louisiana  and spoke passionately about how coastal wetlands and barrier islands functioned as natural storm surge barriers during hurricanes and tropical storms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several years ago I sponsored and passed a bill to bring together a number of individuals and entities to coordinate efforts to clean up Lake Pontchartrain and promote the restoration of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin. Dr. Penland took a leadership role in this effort by helping to bring the university community together to prioritize and coordinate their research activities. The program has been very successful over the last several years, and Dr. Penland deserves a great deal of credit for helping  to achieve that success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Penland's passing is a great loss to the State of Louisiana, and Wendy and I send our thoughts and prayers out to his family, friends, and coworkers. I am positive that Dr. Penland's work will continue to benefit Louisiana and coastal regions throughout the United States for years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus, today, I am proud to honor a fellow Louisianan, Dr. Shea Penland, and thank him for his dedicated and tireless service to our State and country.</paragraph>
