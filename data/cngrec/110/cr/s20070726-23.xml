    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor, and pay tribute to LTC Jean M. McGinnis, who will retire from the U.S. Army on August 31, 2007, after 25 years of distinguished service. Lieutenant Colonel McGinnis is an outstanding American soldier who served in a succession of command and staff positions worldwide of increasing responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In her last assignment in the U.S. Army as the Deputy Chief of the Army, Senate Liaison Division, Lieutenant Colonel McGinnis demonstrated the managerial and leadership skills that have characterized her career. She demonstrated Army values daily, supported her subordinates and chief tirelessly, and traveled extensively escorting Senators, their staffs, and Senate committee professional staff members on inspections and factfinding trips in the United States and overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lieutenant Colonel McGinnis previously served as a Congressional Budget Liaison Officer in the Office of the Chief of Army Reserve and as an Operations Research Analyst in Programs, Analysis, and Evaluation in the Pentagon. From 1982 to 1994, she served as an Aviation Officer, in the positions of Platoon Leader, Detachment Commander, Company and Battalion Flight Operations Officer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During her aviation career Lieutenant Colonel McGinnis had many assignments ranging from humanitarian assistance missions in Guatemala and Honduras to piloting the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army in Egypt as part of Operation Bright Star.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1997, Lieutenant Colonel McGinnis was assigned to the Office of the Chief of Army Reserve in Washington, DC, as an Operations Research Systems Analyst. During this assignment she reconciled Army Reserve resource requirements with Army program needs. She later served as a Budget Analyst in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, Resource Division.
