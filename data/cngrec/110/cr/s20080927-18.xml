    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me take a few moments to say what an absolutely outstanding privilege it has been for me, for 10 of the 12 years I have served in the Senate, to serve on the Energy Committee with Senator Domenici.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is rare to see a person in public office who cares equally as deeply about his family and his children and his work. Sometimes families get pushed aside because of the work of men and women who think the work they do is somehow more important than raising their children. I have experienced struggling for that balance in my own life, watching my father struggle with that balance. Sitting on the committee watching Senator Domenici has been an inspiration to me, to watch him handle some  of the biggest issues of our time, truly, over 36 years. He spoke about some of them--the budgets of the entire Congress, the nuclear renaissance in the country, major pieces of social legislation he has shepherded and nurtured and loved. But in between many of these discussions I have been privileged to have with him, he will stop in the middle of a conversation and talk about one of his children or one of his grandchildren. He is the father of eight. I am one of nine and the mother of two.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to tell him, in these brief moments--and I am just going to speak for 2 or 3 minutes--what an inspiration he has been to me as a man who loves his wife and his children and his grandchildren so deeply and has managed to serve his State with such passion and grace and love for 36 years. And New Mexico is not a next-door kind of place. New Mexico is a long way from Washington, DC, but it has never been long from the Senator's heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final thing I want to say is that, on behalf of the people of my State, I want the Senator from New Mexico to know we will be forever grateful for his leadership when it came to passing, for us, something in the nature of the Declaration of Independence. And I don't mean to belittle that document, but for the people of Louisiana, who for 60 years have struggled to try to find some way to preserve this great coast of ours and to save our communities, our culture, and our economic livelihood,  this Senator stepped up, this Senator from New Mexico--not much water there--and his heart was with the people of Louisiana and the gulf coast. He and his wife flew over this great expanse of land, which has been under water now for quite some time with these storms in the last years, and he basically took the lead</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Senator, I could speak for a long time--many more hours--about what you have done, but there are other Members much more senior to me and in your own party who wish to speak. I just wanted to lay down for the record the comment to you--and I will submit a more formal statement for the Record--that the people of Louisiana whom I represent will be forever grateful for your leadership.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am sorry to see Pete Domenici leave the Senate for a variety of reasons but one highly personal: He is reducing by 25 percent the number of Senators now serving who served with my father. Senator Byrd, Senator Kennedy, Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, and Senator Biden all served with my father, as did Senator Domenici. Now, he has told me that my father was never quite able to pronounce his name correctly,  for which I apologize. I have learned how to do it so that the Bennett family is relieved of that particular problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This demonstrates a degree of continuity and a degree of dedication to the problems related to the West because New Mexico and Utah are neighboring States. We touch at one tiny point. It is the only point in the United States where four States come together. It is called the Four Corners, where four States, in a straight divide, come and touch each other. But New Mexico and Utah share many of the same problems, and as I have come to the Senate with the problems of the West and had to turn somewhere  for a mentor to help guide me through those problems, I have turned to Senator Domenici. His advice has always been good, his help has always been available, and he has proven to be as good a friend to his western neighbors as he has been to his New Mexican constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the Senate seniority rule holds in place, I will succeed him as the ranking member of the Energy and Water Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations. These are very big shoes to fill. In true Domenici style, instead of just waving goodbye and walking out the door, he has tucked me under his arm and taken me around to all of the national labs to make sure that these beloved institutions, which he has tended and funded and guided so carefully, got introduced to me under his tutelage  and so that he made sure that I understood fully how important they were. In very kind and subtle ways, he made it clear to me that if I didn't stand up to the responsibility of keeping those national treasures alive, he would haunt me in one way or another. Now, I hope he does. I hope he is available for years to come for advice and counsel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other thing that has been referred to here, on which I have been delighted to join with him, is his crusade for insurance equality for the mentally disturbed. He and I both have some experience with that with members of our own families. We understand how  important that is, and it has been easy to be a foot soldier in the ranks, with Pete Domenici leading the charge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a phrase that has been used and vastly overused around these halls in Washington for a long time, but it applies accurately to Pete Domenici. He truly has been a national treasure, and we shall miss him but wish him well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, what a privilege it has been for myself and many of my colleagues to sit here in the presence this afternoon to not hear a goodbye to the Senate, because the Senate, Senator Domenici, will always look up to you. You will be the model which young men and women coming to the Senate will wish to follow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know whether anyone can do what you have done throughout the Senate with greater feeling and sincerity. Mr. President, when Senator Domenici greets and visits with you, he always finishes that with "I love you, brother" or "I love you, sister."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless you and your family.</paragraph>
