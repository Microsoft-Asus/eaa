    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, some on the other side of the aisle made it a habit to refer to the last session of Congress as a do-nothing Congress. But it seems our friends on the other side are trying to outdo the do-nothingness they complained about all last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First they clamped down on the House rules to expedite their so-called 6 for '06 agenda. Almost none of that became law. Then they delayed an emergency troop funding bill for more than 100 days while our troops in harm's way waited for the resources they needed to do their job. Now they seem intent on playing another round of chicken with the President over this year's appropriations bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you throw in hidden earmarks, slush funds, budget gimmicks and the largest tax increase in American history, it's no wonder the Democrat Congress is currently enjoying its lowest approval ratings ever. Do-nothing Congress? Perhaps now we should say do-less-than-nothing Congress.</paragraph>
