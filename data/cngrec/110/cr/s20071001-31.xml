    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish today to recognize a fellow New Mexican, Michael Hooffstetter, for his hard work and advocacy on behalf of individuals living with Parkinson's disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael is in Washington this week receiving a very prestigious award from the Parkinson's Action Network, the Milly Kondracke Award. The award's namesake was a well-known Parkinson's advocate who worked tirelessly to increase awareness of this disease and support Federal funding for research until her death in 2004. The award is presented annually to an advocate who demonstrates the incredible strength of spirit and commitment to advocacy that Milly demonstrated. I am very pleased that this  year's recipient is Michael Hooffstetter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each of the last several years, Michael and others from New Mexico have come to Washington and met with me to discuss programs that help those suffering with Parkinson's disease. As the New Mexico State coordinator for the Parkinson's Action Network, Michael speaks candidly about his disease, the treatments he has undergone, and the effect it has had on him and his family. Michael's Air Force service has given him a special interest in the Department of Defense Neurotoxin Exposure Treatment and  Research Program. I have always appreciated his honesty and insight and admire him for his advocacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael Hooffstetter has helped many people by dedicating his time and efforts through the Parkinson's Action Network. I congratulate him for this award.</paragraph>
