  <narrative>There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the 7th Annual "National Substitute Teacher Recognition Week," which is celebrated in conjunction with Teacher Appreciation Week. This is a national effort to recognize the approximately 270,000 men and women that fill in for absent permanent teachers every day in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to research performed by the Substitute Teaching Institute--STI--at Utah State University, as much as 1 full year of a child's elementary and secondary education is taught by substitute teachers. More often than not, these are talented individuals who are willing to take on the challenge of providing quality education when permanent teachers are out of the classroom. I believe it is only appropriate that we do something to recognize the efforts of these members of our communities who  fill a void in the education of our children and play a vital role in maintaining continuity of instruction and a positive learning environment for students throughout our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to recognize and commend the work and dedication of the Substitute Teaching Institute. Established in 1995, STI provides substitute teachers with training materials to improve the quality of their contribution to classroom activities. Over the last 12 years, STI has evolved and grown to become one of our Nation's leaders in the effort to improve substitute teaching, providing training materials and services along with recruitment and retention assistance to school districts  and substitute teachers around the world. Having expanded its work over the years, the STI continually works to revolutionize the role of substitute teachers into opportunities for educational excellence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am joined by Senators Clinton and Cochran in submitting a resolution designating May 5-9, 2008 as National Substitute Teacher Recognition Week, and I urge all my colleagues to lend their support.</paragraph>

  <chair>
    <bill type="sr" number="544">S. Res. 544</bill>
  </chair>
  <chair>Whereas, on average, as much as 1 full year of a child's elementary and secondary education is taught by substitute teachers;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on any given day in the United States, more than 270,000 classes are taught by substitute teachers;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas formal training of substitute teachers has been shown to improve the quality of education, lower school district liability, reduce the number of student and faculty complaints, and increase retention rates of substitute teachers;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas a strong, effective system of education for all children and youth is essential to our Nation's continued strength and prosperity;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas much of a child's growth and progress can be attributed to the efforts of dedicated teachers and substitute teachers who are entrusted with the child's educational development;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas substitute teachers play a vital role in maintaining continuity of instruction and a positive learning environment in the absence of a permanent classroom teacher; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas substitute teachers should be recognized for their dedication and commitment: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the Senate--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) designates May 5 through 9, 2008, as the 7th annual National Substitute Teacher Recognition Week;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) recognizes the important and vital role substitute teachers play in a child's education; and</chair>
  <chair> (3) encourages educational institutions to observe the week with appropriate events and activities.&lt;p/&gt;END&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;</chair>
