  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, following my remarks and any the Republican leader wishes to make, we will resume consideration of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Senator Dorgan and Senator Murkowski are here. I believe this is our fourth day. Someone told me yesterday: But they were short days. The only reason they were short is because nobody has been here to offer any amendments. They would have been longer days, as I indicated last night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope people will come and offer amendments. That is what we need to do. We need to move through this legislation. We have been told that Members who have amendments are waiting to offer them. I hope they will do that. We are going to finish the bill this week. We have a break coming next week. We really would like to get the work done. We could finish it today. I hope we can do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
