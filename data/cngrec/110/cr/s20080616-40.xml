  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report the bill by title.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:</chair>
  <chair>A bill (<bill type="h" number="3403">H.R. 3403</bill>) to promote and enhance public safety by facilitating the rapid deployment of IP-enabled 911 and E-911 services, encourage the Nation's transition to a national IP-enabled emergency network, and improve 911 and E-911 access to those with disabilities.</chair>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today in support of the substitute to <bill type="h" number="3403">H.R. 3403</bill>, the New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008. The Senate companion, <bill type="s" number="428">S. 428</bill>, was passed by unanimous consent on February 26, 2008. This bill would provide 911 service for Voice over Internet Protocol, VoIP, subscribers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can think of few government initiatives that have been as successful as 911. Since its creation nearly 30 years ago, 911 has become a lifeline for people in trouble. I think it is safe to say that just about every American today knows that 911 is the easiest and most effective means to contact emergency services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As technology has advanced, so has 911 service. Today, many places in the Nation have E911. In these areas, when you call for help, your phone number and location are automatically transmitted to emergency personnel. If your call is disconnected, you are disoriented, or do not know your location, this information can make all the difference in securing your safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the E911 system was built for wireline service. So as technology advanced and wireless phones grew in popularity, we worked to apply E911 principles to wireless service. With the advent of VoIP, we are challenged again to ensure that our 911 policies are up to date.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008 does an excellent job of improving 911 service and adapting it to the latest telecommunications technology, and I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Bill Nelson, the sponsor of the Senate bill, Senator Snowe, Senator Stevens, and I have worked with our colleagues in the House to develop this substitute. Once the Senate passes <bill type="h" number="3403">H.R. 3403</bill>, as amended, we expect the House to act expeditiously so that this bill can become law, allowing our 911 system to continue to save lives and ensuring individuals can always call for help regardless of the underlying technology they use.</paragraph>
