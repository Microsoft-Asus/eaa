  <speaking speaker="412214" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today the House will consider one of the most important pieces of legislation that we have worked on this year: the Defense authorization conference report. It includes provisions to restore our Nation's military readiness as well as protecting our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This critical bill restores our military readiness by authorizing $1 billion for the Strategic Readiness Fund that will require an in-depth status of our forces, especially our National Guard, and requires a plan to reconstitute that force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation offers assistance to our most precious and important resource: our warriors and their families who sacrifice so much. It provides a 3.5 percent pay increase for servicemembers and prohibits increased health care fees while improving the health care system. The bill addresses the growing needs of our troops that require care in traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, other mental health conditions, tuition assistance programs, and also authorizes a unique program  that was started in my State of Minnesota called Beyond the Yellow Ribbon to reintegrate our forces back to civilian life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am proud that this Congress will pass legislation this week to provide our troops with the resources and health care benefits they deserve and protect our Nation's readiness.</paragraph>
