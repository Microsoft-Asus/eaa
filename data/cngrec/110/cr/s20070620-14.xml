  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Employee Free Choice Act sponsored by Senator Kennedy. Unions helped build our country. They have led the fight for critical worker safety and worker rights protections that all Americans now enjoy. They help raise wages for low- and middle-wage workers and can help close the gap from rising income inequalities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Being a part of a union pays off for workers. For example, union cashiers earn 46 percent more than nonunion cashiers. Union food preparation workers earn 50 percent more than nonunion food preparation workers. And union maids and housekeepers earn 31 percent more than nonunion maids and housekeepers. Overall, median weekly earnings for union workers are $191 higher than those of nonunion workers, and this difference is even more significant for minority groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Union workers are also almost twice as likely to receive employer-sponsored health benefits and more than four times more likely to have a secure, defined-benefit pension plan than nonunion workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rate of unionization in America is declining and with it workers' income. In 1973, 42.4 percent of workers in Michigan were in unions. By 2006, that number had fallen to just 19.7 percent of workers. As union membership declines, so has Michigan's real median household income, which fell 14.9 percent between 1999 and 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is not a lack of interest from workers. Fifty-three percent of U.S. workers state they would join a union if they could and 62 percent believe they would be worse off if unions did not exist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is the difficulties that are presented to those who seek to unionize a shop or industry. The current system does not adequately protect the workers that unionization campaigns are supposed to help and support. Workers are fired in 25 percent of private-sector union organizing campaigns. Seventy-eight percent of employers require that supervisors deliver antiunion messages to their employees. One-third of workers who unionize their workplace never even get a contract.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a duty to make sure that workers who want to join unions and unionize their workplace can do so, and that's what the Employee Free Choice Act will do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The most significant provision in the bill allows for a union shop to be created through a process called a majority sign-up. Majority sign-up has been used for at least the past 70 years. In 2004, for example, about five times as many workers joined the AFL-CIO through a majority sign-up than those who were able to unionize through the National Labor Relations Board process. A majority sign up process results in less employer pressure and fewer delays than NLRB elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, however, employers do not have to recognize employees that have a majority sign-up as a union, although many responsible companies, including Cingular and Kaiser Permanente, do. This bill would change that--if a majority of workers signs authorizations designating a union as their bargaining representative, then that union would be recognized as such.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opponents of this bill have spread a great deal of misinformation about this provision. Many people believe the bill would take away an employee's right to a "secret ballot" union election. That is not true. This bill would still allow individuals the right to an NLRB  supervised election if at least 30 percent of employees want it. This bill also allows employees to form unions using another method as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Employee Free Choice Act would also establish penalties for companies that coerce or intimidate employees and would provide for mediation and binding arbitration when the employer and workers cannot agree on a first contract. In short, it makes needed updates to our labor laws to better protect workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By allowing employees to form unions through a majority sign-up, we are supporting a worker's freedom to form a union and to bargain for better pay and better benefits. Experience has shown that this will be a good deal for the worker and a boost for America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, since joining this body in 1993, I have supported a number of initiatives to help the hard working men and women of this country, including increasing the minimum wage, supporting equal pay for America's workers, and promoting better trade policies. One piece of legislation that would help American workers is the Employee Free Choice Act, EFCA, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of EFCA again this Congress. I commend my colleague, the senior Senator from Massachusetts,  Senator Kennedy, for his hard work on this legislation, as well as his longstanding dedication to improving the quality of life for America's working people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the best things we can do for American workers is to remove obstacles that make it harder for them to form and join unions. As many of my colleagues will likely point out in the course of this debate, more than 60 million U.S. workers say they would join a union today if they could. Further, workers who belong to unions earn 30 percent more than nonunion workers, are 62 percent more likely to have employer-provided health care, and are four times more likely to have a pension. Better wages  and better benefits help lift Americans out of poverty and into the middle class. Far too many Americans are working for wages that keep them at or below the Federal poverty line with little, if any, opportunity to bargain for better wages and benefits or advance to a better-paying position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Employee Free Choice Act would address some of the inequities in the current system of collective bargaining in the U.S. Many critics of this legislation focus on the card check provision, but there is much more to this legislation than just the method of voting. This bill provides for first-contract mediation and arbitration. Importantly, if an agreement has not been reached after 90 days of negotiations, either the employer or the employees can refer the dispute to the Federal Mediation  and Conciliation Service for mediation. Clearly, under the ideal negotiation this would not be necessary, but it is an important option for employees to have in the collective bargaining process. The bill also provides for stronger penalties for employer violations while employees are attempting to form a union. Employers who intimidate workers attempting to unionize should face appropriate consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I understand that the vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to the Employee Free Choice Act may not be successful this week, this fight is far from over. Over the last 2 years, I have received over 1,500 letters, calls, and e-mails in support of this legislation from my constituents, and their voices mean a great deal. I support passage of this legislation for the hard-working Wisconsinites who deserve better from us. I am disappointed that more of my colleagues have not joined in supporting  this bill, and I hope that they will rethink their opposition to this bill. I will continue working to pass this important legislation.</paragraph>
