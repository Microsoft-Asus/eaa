  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are going to have an hour of morning business as soon as Senator McConnell and I finish our opening remarks, if any.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following morning business, the Senate will proceed to the consideration of <bill type="s" number="2731">S. 2731</bill>, the global AIDS legislation. As I announced on Friday, there will be no rollcall votes today. Senators should be permitted to vote on amendments tomorrow morning before the recess for the caucus luncheons; if not on amendments, there will be things to vote on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, in addition to considering the global AIDS bill, the Senate may turn to the consideration of LIHEAP, gas prices/market manipulation, Medicare veto override, if, in fact, the President does override that veto on Medicare. We have to wait until the House acts first on that.</paragraph>
