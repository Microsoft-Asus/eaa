    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to an issue of great concern to the people of my district. When I was home in Indianapolis this weekend I heard from countless homeowners who are concerned about losing their homes and the mortgage crisis. These are good, hardworking people, not speculators or investors, who find themselves on the brink of foreclosure. And the Hoosiers I met aren't alone. Some estimate that nearly 50,000 homes in Indiana will be lost to this  crisis if we fail to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indiana families are counting on Congress, and we are taking action. I am proud to serve on the Financial Services Committee, where we are continuing to work on a plan that will provide real relief to homeowners who are struggling. Our plan will help ease the mortgage crisis and help more homeowners stay in their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I am proud that the legislation includes an amendment I have offered to ensure organizations that serve minority communities have the resources they need to counsel and support homeowners in trouble. Many of these communities have been hit especially hard by this crisis, and it's essential that organizations who serve these neighborhoods can step in and help prevent more foreclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the economic downturn is taking its toll on families in Indianapolis, and we know we can't get our economy back on track unless we address the housing crisis. It is my sincere hope that Members on both sides of the aisle and the President will work together to ensure homeowners stay in their homes and end this crisis.</paragraph>
