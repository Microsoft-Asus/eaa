  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the decision has been made that we are going to try to work with Dr. Coburn tomorrow to see if we can get part of the 34 bills he has held up for long periods of time, to see if we can get some of those passed by unanimous consent. There is a possibility that we can get 8 or 10 of them done and if we could, that would be very nice. If we can't, we will wait until next year when we have more opportunity to do things such as this and less problems of people holding  things up. So we are going to do the best we can.</paragraph>
