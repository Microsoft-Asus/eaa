    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish today, June 6, 2008, the 64th anniversary of the Allied Powers' invasion of Normandy, to pay tribute to Henry and Homer Montgomery, two brothers who answered their Nation's call to duty. These brothers, like so many of their peers, gave up the comforts of home to go to an unfamiliar land to fight in defense of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry Montgomery, now 92, hit the beach at Normandy on June 7, 1944. He served in the European theater as an artilleryman and motorcycle courier, walking much of the way between Normandy and Berlin. This journey of nearly 1,000 miles was so arduous that when he arrived in Berlin, he was medically discharged and returned to our shores on a hospital ship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Homer Montgomery, now 82, served in the Pacific theater toward the end of World War II halfway around the world from his brother. He was a Military Police officer who served through the end of the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The contributions made by these two brothers are an excellent example of the sacrifices made by our greatest generation. They were able to see our nation and our allies emerge from the war victorious and return home unlike so many of their brothers in arms. Their commitment to this struggle and that of their comrades was critical to securing our liberties, and our nation is forever indebted to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, Mr. President I am honored to pay tribute to these two great American patriots. May they greatly enjoy the freedom they have secured for all of us.</paragraph>
