    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are working with the Republican leader's staff to arrange for votes throughout tomorrow's session in relation to several amendments. So Members should be on notice there will be a vote at approximately 10:30 tomorrow morning, and there will be other votes throughout the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say that we have five or six amendments all teed up to vote on. We have a few more things--we have one we thought we could vote on in the morning, but we could not get the person offering the amendment on the minority side to allow us to go forward. We hope we can work that out either later tonight or in the morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We would like to move through this bill, but we cannot do that unless people are willing to let us vote on their amendments. So after the vote tomorrow at 10:30, hopefully we will have more to tell the body as to what votes have been able to be lined up for later in the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone should know that it is unlikely there will be any votes from about 1 to 2 o'clock tomorrow. Other than that, everything is fair game.</paragraph>
