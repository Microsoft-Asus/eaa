    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Iraq supplemental bill being brought to the floor today is a bad idea wrapped in the wrong intentions. This is a time when Congress ought to be working together to provide our troops with the tools and the resources necessary to do their job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, the Democrat leadership is committed to a strategy that spells nothing but failure in Iraq. They are telling the commanders in the field that 535 politicians know better how to do their job. It is irresponsible for Members of Congress to play Commander in Chief. There is too much at stake in Iraq for political grandstanding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill sends the wrong message to our soldiers, our allies and our enemies. It tells our troops that we have got no faith in them. It tells our allies that we lack the resolve of our stated commitment, and it tells our enemies all they have to do is wait.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is shameful partisan politics that puts our troops at greater risk. It is wrong, and the American people are watching.</paragraph>
