    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is day 38. That is 38 days so far that our veterans have not had the use of the increased funding for their benefits and health care. That's $18.5 million a day not able to be used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In June, this House passed this appropriation bill with a $6 billion increase in a bipartisan manner. On September 6, the Senate completed their  bill. The President has agreed to sign this bill. Instead, the Democratic leadership has decided to use funding for our veterans as a smokescreen in an effort to pass billions in unrelated domestic spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our veterans are not pawns in a political game. They are heroes. These funding issues should have been considered separately and on their own merits. Please join me in calling upon the Democratic leadership to put our veterans first and send a clean Veterans appropriation bill to the President now.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
