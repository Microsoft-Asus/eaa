  <narrative>THE ENERGY BILL -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H14449]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400273" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, not only will the Americans receive a great surprise with a tax increase with the so-called energy bill that was just passed by the House of Representatives, and higher fuel costs; I want to announce, as the Republican leader on the Transportation Committee, you've also depleted the highway trust fund by some $2.1 billion in this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congressional Budget Office is already predicting a $5 billion deficit in the highway trust fund by 2009.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, my friends in Congress, we can't keep this game up. Unfortunately, in the full year 2007 appropriations resolution that passed the House, we knocked another $3.47 billion and rescinded that from the highway trust fund, and another $3 billion recession from the highway program in the 2008 bill that passed the House recently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the game being played with our Nation's highway trust fund has consequences, and we will pay.</paragraph>
