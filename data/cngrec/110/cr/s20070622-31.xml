    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Colorado's oldest family-owned business--the R&amp;R Market in the town of San Luis, in Costilla County, CO. My family has ranched and farmed in the San Luis Valley for five generations just a few miles west of San Luis. I grew up knowing the R&amp;R Market as one of the treasures of the valley, a great symbol of our shared history and heritage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colorado was built upon the ingenuity, hard work, and entrepreneurial spirit of people like Don Jos&#xE9; Dario Gallegos, who traveled from the San Luis Valley by mule train over the Santa Fe Trail to trade centers in St. Louis and Independence, Missouri. Don Dario Gallegos was among the founders of the town of San Luis in 1851 and helped establish some of the first water rights in the area. The irrigation ditches--or acequias--that he and the settlers dug are still in use today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Don Dario Gallegos opened his store in San Luis in 1857, Colorado was still a young territory, and statehood was nearly 20 years away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though the physical foundation of Don Jos&#xE9; Dario Gallegos's original adobe structure would be destroyed in an 1895 fire, the people of San Luis came together to form the indestructible foundation rooted in a commitment to community and family that sustains the R&amp;R Market to this very day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is this commitment that the people of San Luis will celebrate on June 30, 150 years after the original R&amp;R Market opened its doors. I congratulate the Gallegos descendants--who still own and operate the market--and the people of San Luis on this momentous anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a painting of the R&amp;R Market hanging in my Washington, DC, office. It serves as an everyday reminder of the place I come from--a place where community and family mean everything, a place where the spirit of Colorado was born and continues to thrive. I am honored to represent that place and the people who come from it.</paragraph>
