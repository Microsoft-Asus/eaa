    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to welcome and recognize Ms. Jeri Brooks Greenwell as today's guest chaplain. Ms. Greenwell is from Bethel, Maine, and is a member of the West Paris Congregational Church. She's also the National Chaplain of the American Legion Auxiliary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Greenwell has dedicated much of her adult life in community service. She has been an active member of the Legion Auxiliary since 1974, holding numerous positions. Her service extends deep into her community. Ms. Greenwell is a life member of the Bethel Historical Society, a former Literacy Volunteer, a member of the Maine's Children Alliance, a member of the Maine Handicapped Skiing Veterans Program, and a National spokesperson for the National Meningitis Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Greenwell is joined by other members of the American Legion. I would like to welcome them as well. I am proud that Ms. Greenwell is my constituent, and it is an honor to have her deliver today's prayer.</paragraph>
