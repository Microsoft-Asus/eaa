  <narrative>CONSOLIDATED NATURAL RESOURCES ACT OF 2008 -- (Senate - April 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="2862">S2862</bill>]</narrative>
  <chair> Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to consideration of <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>, which the clerk will report.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:</chair>
  <chair>A bill (<bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>) to authorize certain programs and activities in the Department of the Interior, the Forest Service, and the Department of Energy, to implement further the Act approving the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America, to amend the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003, and for other purposes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I know my colleague from New Mexico will be here in a few minutes and wishes to make a statement in support of the legislation that is before us now. I will start by making my own statement, a general statement about it. I know Senator Wyden also is here on the Senate floor and wishes to speak on this issue and on this legislation. I know, of course, Senator Coburn is also very nearby and wishes to make a statement as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate will consider at this time <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>. It is a collection of over 60 noncontroversial bills that have been reported from the Energy and Natural Resources Committee dealing with various public land, national park, water, and territorial issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me start by thanking Senator Reid, our majority leader, for making it possible for us to proceed with this bill at this time. This has been a priority of his for several months now, to get this legislation before the Senate. He deserves great credit for doing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of the individual bills included in <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> have been passed by the House of Representatives and virtually all of the bills--or their Senate companion measures--have also been favorably reported by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The committee votes on reporting these bills have been unanimous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Typically, these bills would be considered individually and passed under a unanimous consent agreement. Unfortunately, as most Senators are aware, it has become virtually impossible to get unanimous consent to pass anything this year. So despite the fact these bills generally deal with State-specific issues and have the strong support of the affected congressional delegation, and despite the fact that these bills are noncontroversial--having passed the House of Representatives and having been  reported by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee with overwhelming bipartisan support--we have not been able to get them cleared.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an attempt to move these bills forward, last month I introduced <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>, which simply incorporates every bill our committee has reported that has also been passed by the House of Representatives. The package includes roughly an equal mix of Democratic-sponsored bills, Republican-sponsored bills, and bills with bipartisan sponsors. As I have already noted, since these bills have been reported out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee by unanimous votes, there really are not any outstanding  issues in dispute. Many of the individual bills that are included in this package have been on the Senate calendar for several months; in fact several were reported by our committee and have been pending on the calendar since January of last year--not January of 2008 but January of 2007. A number of the bills have been approved by the Senate--by unanimous consent, I might add--in previous Congresses, in some cases in several previous Congresses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the individual bills in this package may not be controversial, they are nonetheless very important to the individual sponsors, and the Senate has an obligation to try and pass these bills. I would like to take a few minutes to briefly identify some of the provisions included within <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bills included within <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> encompass lands and activities in over 30 States and the District of Columbia. The first provision in the package is Senator Murray's and Senator Cantwell's proposal to designate the 106,000-acre Wild Sky wilderness in Washington State, which the Senate has passed in each of the last three previous Congresses. The Wild Sky wilderness is an important addition to the National Wilderness Preservation, and has strong local and national support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another provision in the bill includes language sponsored by Senators Wyden and Akaka to give the National Park Service important new authority to enter into cooperative agreements to protect threatened natural resources in national parks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> also includes additions to the Minidoka National Monument in Idaho and Washington State, the Carl Sandburg National Historic Site in North Carolina, and the Lowell National Historical Park in Massachusetts, and the bill provides the National Park Service with important new authorities at Acadia National Park in Maine and Denali National Park in Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It authorizes studies of potential new parks in Missouri, Texas, Arkansas, California, Arizona, and Massachusetts to assess whether any would be appropriate for addition to the National Park System, and it establishes commissions to commemorate significant anniversaries of the Hudson and Champlain expeditions in what are now the northeastern United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> would designate two new Outstanding Natural Areas to be managed by the Bureau of Land Management: the Piedras Blancas Historic Light Station in California, and the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse in Florida. It also allows for BLM land in Nevada to be transferred for use by the Nevada National Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The package includes a new addition to the Wild and Scenic River System in Connecticut, and a new addition to the National Trails System, the "Star-Spangled Banner" National Historic Trail in Virginia and Maryland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill includes authorizations related to new commemorative works in the District of Columbia, including one honoring President Eisenhower, and establishes a commission to study the potential creation of a National Museum of the American Latino, here in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> would establish three new National Heritage Areas: the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area in Illinois; the Niagara Falls National Heritage Area in New York, and the multi-State Journey Through Hallowed Ground National Heritage Area in Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania, and it authorizes studies of potential new heritage areas in Oregon and Kentucky. It would also increase the authorization ceiling for several existing heritage areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will help address the water resource challenges facing many regions of the country. There are 16 provisions in the bill affecting States west-wide, including sections that will promote partnerships between the Federal Government, States, and local entities in the area of water, including paying for security costs at Bureau of Reclamation facilities; ensure a better understanding of groundwater resources; facilitate a feasibility study of serious proposals to address water shortages  and avoid litigation; transfer Federal property to local ownership and eliminate Federal restrictions impeding water conservation projects; promote water recycling activities; and authorize Federal participation in the Platte River Endangered Species Recovery Program, which is strongly supported in Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the critical nature of many of these items, it's important that these water-related authorities be enacted as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2379">S. 2379</bill> also reauthorizes two energy programs at the Department of Energy. One clarifies the Secretary of Energy's authority to make grants to advanced energy efficiency technology transfer centers under the Energy Policy Act of2005, and the other reauthorizes the Steel and Aluminum Energy Conservation and Technology Competitiveness Act of 1988.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The package contains two important measures related to the territories. The first involves the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands--CNMI--to respond to longstanding Federal concerns regarding immigration, labor, and law enforcement--concerns that are greatly heightened following the September 11 attacks. This bill culminates 11 years of congressional and executive branch efforts to extend the U.S. immigration laws to the CNMI including the establishment of Federal border control as anticipated  by the 1976 covenant agreement between the CNMI and the United States. The bill also includes special provisions to meet the special needs of the islands' economy. The citizens of the CNMI have been U.S. citizens and members of the U.S. family for over 20 years, but they have been unable to participate in  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final title of <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> would make numerous amendments to the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and the Pacific island nations of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As lengthy as that summary of the provisions in <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> was, it reflects only a portion of the bills that have been considered in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee this Congress. This package reflects only a first step of Energy Committee bills that need to be considered this year. As soon as <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> is passed, I will assemble a second package, with a similar number of bills, containing legislation that has been approved by our committee, but which has not yet come over from the other  body. Like this package, the second bill will be a wide-ranging collection of authorizing measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But regardless of whether the individual items in that package are large or small, all these bills will have been reported by our committee after a full public process. I know many Senators who have bills that will be, in fact, in that second package rather than in this first package and are eager for us to move ahead. I would point out the New Mexico-specific bills I have sponsored will be in that second package; they are not in the legislation before us today. So I share in that desire to move  expeditiously, and I look forward to working with Senator Domenici and the majority leader and, of course, the Republican Leader as well to try to get that second package ready for floor consideration as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senate rule XLIV requires the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction to certify that each Congressionally directed spending item in any bill coming before the Senate has been identified and disclosed on a publicly accessible Congressional Web site. The rule defines "congressionally directed spending items" as spending items "included primarily at the request of a Senator."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I included none of the House-passed bills in <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>, primarily at the request of a Senator, in the interests of full disclosure I have provided a list of all spending authorizations for specific amounts targeted to specific localities contained in <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>, along with the name of the sponsor of the Senate companion of the House-passed bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This list has been made available on the Web site of the Committee of Energy and Natural Resources since March 11 and was previously printed in the Congressional Record on March 11, at page <bill type="s" number="1869">S. 1869</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I ask unanimous consent that the list, along with my letter to the Majority Leader accompanying the list, be printed in the Record for the information of all Senators.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>U.S. Senate, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, March 11, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR MR. LEADER: <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>, the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, which I introduced yesterday, is a collection of 62 separate legislative measures under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The purpose of the bill is to facilitate consideration in the Senate of the large and growing number of measures relating to protection of natural resources and preservation of our historic heritage that have been passed by the House of Representatives and approved  by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Forty-three of the measures in <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> consist of the text of separate bills passed by the House of Representatives, twelve are drawn from separate titles, subtitles, or sections of two other House-passed bills, and two are House-passed concurrent resolutions. Only one provision, section 482, contains new matter that has not passed the House of Representatives.</narrative>
  <narrative>While <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> incorporates a number of provisions of <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill>, the National Forests, Parks, Public Land, and Reclamation Projects Authorization Act of 2007, which I introduced three months ago, on December 14, 2007, there are a number of differences between the bills that are dictated by the amount of time that has elapsed since last December and by action that has since taken place in the House of Representatives. Two of the sections included in <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill> last December were subsequently enacted  into law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, Public Law 110-161, and, accordingly, have been left out of <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>. Eight new provisions, drawn from eight separate House bills or resolutions, have been added. Two of the effective dates in title VIII of <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill> have been extended in <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> in light of the passage of time since <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill> was introduced. In addition, minor modifications were made in a few other provisions.</narrative>
  <narrative>Although <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> has not been referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, all of the House bills that make up <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> or their Senate companions have either been reported or ordered reported by the Committee.</narrative>
  <narrative>Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate provides that, before proceeding to the consideration of a bill, the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction must certify that each congressionally designated spending item in the bill and the name of the Senator requesting it has been identified and posted on a publicly accessible website. The term "congressionally designated spending item" is broadly defined, in pertinent part, to include "a provision ... included primarily at the request of  a Senator ..... authorizing ..... a specific amount of discretionary budget authority ..... for ..... expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or Congressional district, other than through a statutory or administrative formula-driven or competitive award process."</narrative>
  <narrative>Fifteen of the House-passed measures incorporated into <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> contain provisions authorizing the appropriation of specific amounts targeted to specific entities or localities. These authorizations are included in <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> because they are part of the text of the House-passed bills. No Senator submitted a request to me to include them.</narrative>
  <narrative>In the interest of furthering the transparency and accountability of the legislative process, however, I have posted a list of the specific authorizations in <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> on the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources' website. The list includes the name of the principal sponsor of the Senate companion measure that corresponds to the House-passed bill. A copy of the list is attached for your convenience.</narrative>
  <narrative>I previously asked the principal sponsor of the Senate companion measure of each House bill contained in <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill> to certify that neither the Senator nor the Senator's immediate family has a pecuniary interest in the item, and have posted the certifications I have received on the Committee's website. All certifications received in relation to <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill> remain on the Committee's website, where they are available for public inspection in accordance with paragraph 6 of Rule XLIV. I have not received  any requests for new congressionally directed spending items to be included in <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thus, in accordance with Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby certify that each congressionally directed spending item in <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> has been identified through a list and that the list was posted on the Committee's publicly accessible website at approximately 3 p.m. on March 11, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>JEFF BINGAMAN,</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>Committee on Energy and Natural Resources Congressionally Directed Spending Item Certification Pursuant To Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate</narrative>
  <narrative><bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>--THE CONSOLIDATED NATURAL RESOURCES ACT OF 2008</narrative>
  <narrative>Provisions in <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> authorizing appropriations in a specific amount for expenditure with or to an entity or targeted to a specific State, locality, or congressional district, other than through a statutory or administrative formula-driven or competitive award process:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>While I have previously tried to describe all the provisions in the package, I believe the individual sponsors can better describe the merits of some of their specific provisions. I am sure many of them will want to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passage of <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> will not only allow us to send this to the House and then to the President, it will also allow us to move forward and address the many legislative pending requests within our Energy and Natural Resources Committee that have been awaiting consideration behind this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is important to remember all the individual provisions included in the package were previously approved by the House of Representatives. I know in a few minutes the Senate will also be considering four amendments that have not been approved either in the House or by our Energy and Natural Resources Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To ensure that we do not jeopardize the enactment of <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>, I will be opposing all those amendments, and I will urge my colleagues to do so as well, so we can finally pass this bill in a form the House can quickly pass and send to the President for his signature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I indicated before, I know Senator Domenici wishes to make a statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Mexico.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Bingaman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>, the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008. This bill is a collection of 62 individual measures that were in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee that have been considered favorably and reported to the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Packaging individual bills into a single bill is not typically the way we get the natural resources side of the Energy Committee business done. It is not my preference to do it this way. However, our customary procedure has been turned on its head since the beginning of the 109th Congress, and the fact that we are here considering this bill on the floor today reflects the frustration of many Members in this regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have served on this committee for over 30 years, 4 of those as chairman and the past 2 as ranking Republican member. The recent controversy over consideration of this bill is simply a continuation of the efforts by the junior Senator from Oklahoma, since the beginning of the 109th Congress, to frustrate, in my opinion, the legitimate business of this committee and the Senate in maintaining proper oversight over the stewardship of Federal lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I am pleased my colleague's concern about the unanimous consent process on an earlier version of this bill has been resolved, I nevertheless remain concerned about the ability of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to conduct its business and that of the Members of the Senate. In addition to the 62 measures in this bill, we have reported over 40 other bills that still need to be considered, and we simply do not have sufficient floor time to consider each of those bills individually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Typically, we have passed these bills by unanimous consent after having worked out any objections by individual Senators to specific provisions. Yet that process we have used for years to get these types of bills passed has ground to a halt because of the generic objections about authorizations from the junior Senator from Oklahoma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I, as chairman, and now Senator Bingaman as chairman, have tried to address the objections, we have been met with new ones each time we think we have resolved the issue. Frankly, I believe much of this problem can be attributed to a lack of understanding about the jurisdiction of the committee, the importance of its business in ensuring proper management of our Nation's natural resource treasures. A bit of history would shed some light on the reasons for many Senators' frustration  and is certainly something that deserves attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Energy and Natural Resources Committee began as a public lands committee nearly 200 years ago, providing oversight over the lands acquired in the Louisiana Purchase. It was one of the first standing committees in the Senate. Over the years its jurisdiction obviously has expanded to include energy issues as well, but easily more than half the committee's business continues to be public lands issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those of you who have served on the committee know this includes everything from our national parks and monuments to all the Bureau of Reclamation water projects. The committee oversees the management of the Department of Interior and the Forest Service, of 535 million acres of land, and includes 58 national parks, 88 national monuments, including those on the Mall, and over 428 million acres of wilderness areas. This is over 30 percent of the total area of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee also has oversight of the Bureau of Reclamation projects that include more than 600 dams and reservoirs, including Hoover and Grand Coulee Dams. Our job is to make sure our national treasures are properly managed and that the departments of the executive branch charged with that task maintain a proper balance between the Federal, State, and local interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the committee oversees all matters related to U.S. territories, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Because the jurisdiction is vast, the number of bills the Energy and Natural Resources Committee considers each Congress generally far exceeds that of other Senate committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 109th Congress alone, a total of 491 bills and resolutions have been referred to the committee for consideration. Most of these measures, as with the measures that are embodied in 2739, the bill currently before us, are required because the administrative agencies either have not taken action in addressing such things as boundary adjustments, land exchanges, or other matters relating to Federal lands, as Senators feel are necessary within their States. But in the 109th, we passed fewer  than half of what we should have historically passed in previous Congresses because of the Senator from Oklahoma's objections. I am hoping together we are learning and the Senator from Oklahoma will work with us and understand all these bills are authorization bills, authorizing bills. They do not spend money until something else is done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Money must be appropriated or spent by some committee or administrative body if it has authority because these bills authorize, they do not appropriate. The futile exercise ignores the balance between authorizing committees and appropriations committees; that is, the futile exercise that has been put upon us by the Senator from Oklahoma over the last 2 1/2  years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me pursue this point a little further, Mr. President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Constitution says, "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law. ....." Note that the Constitution says, "appropriations." Under most circumstances, an authorization does not compel an appropriation of money from the Treasury. So, as I have attempted to reason with the Senator from Oklahoma, authorizations that involve the HOPE of appropriations occur all the time in this body. Most of the time, appropriations fall far short of the authorized  level of spending. A case in point is the decision of Congress to not spend as much money on No Child Left Behind as the authorization bill would have allowed. In some cases, appropriations are made in the absence of authorization. So, clearly, the passage of these lands bills compels no appropriations bill in the future, and, thus, no point of order under the Congressional Budget Act lies against  these bills. My attempts to persuade the Senator</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have noted, most of these measures have no direct cost to the Treasury; rather, they set priorities for the Departments for the use of their administrative budgets that will be appropriated each year. But one of the principal objections the Senator from Oklahoma has raised to all the bills the committee has is they cost too much money or, as he puts it: They will some day cost money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That may be true. But the Congressional Budget Office reports on most of these bills that the administrative costs to implement them would be negligible. In the rare instance where the bill would require significant resources, no action could be taken unless there were additional appropriations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, basically, there have been no reasons for holding up these bills. The business of the Committee that is before us in this bill should have been able to have been taken a long time ago. I do not believe the judgment regarding park boundaries in Wyoming, a land exchange in Arizona, a water project in Colorado, should supplant that of the 23 members of the committee--that one Senator should supplant that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those 23 members of this committee make their judgments on information compiled by a professional staff with a combined service of relevant departments in Congress of over 70 years on the Republican staff side alone. They spend a great deal of time on these bills. They know more than anyone else. They give that knowledge to us, the 23 members, and we vote. It is not as if these bills are put together, brought here, much time, effort and money and resources are put into them before they are put  together and before we ask the Senate to pass them. I hope we will not find ourselves in this bind again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have four amendments offered by the junior Senator from Oklahoma. I have seen them all. I do not think any of them have received appropriate hearings. I do not think any of them have had the study that goes into the bill, that are in this bill before us. For that reason and many others, I do not intend to vote for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do thank the Senator from Oklahoma, the junior Senator, for finally arriving at something that will conclude the matter. It will be concluded today, and many Senators will be pleased and many House members will be pleased, and all I can tell them is: We have tried our best to do this sooner, and we will try our best to do the next one sooner rather than later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the face of all of this, I cannot in good conscience vote to delay passage of at least some of the bills that we have worked so hard on in the committee and that are packaged in <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>. The amendments the Senator has filed under the unanimous agreement are sweeping generic changes to aspects of Federal land management. While aspects of some of them may have merit, they should only be considered through the committee process where the substance and consequences can be illuminated and debated  in hearings. I doubt that there is any Senator, including me, who is 100 percent supportive of every line in these bills that compose <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>; but, as with everything else we do around here, there had to be give and take on both sides of the aisle to come to agreement on many of these measures. And since it has not been my experience that we will ever be able to satisfy the junior Senator from Oklahoma, I recommend that we proceed to pass this bill without amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and thank Senator Bingaman for yielding to me.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Oregon.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300100" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wished to begin this morning by thanking Chairman Bingaman for his public assurance today that <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>, the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, will not be the final public lands bill taken up by the Senate this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that is going to be encouraging news to the people of my home State who, in particular, want to see our treasured Mount Hood receive additional protection and want to make sure its scenic beauty will be preserved for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the chair of the Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests, I know firsthand how important these public lands bills are to folks in the States where the lands are located. There are several pieces of legislation that involve my home State. The proposals contained in this bill have all passed the House, passed the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and I hope they will become law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I especially express my appreciation to the distinguished senior Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, who has toiled month after month after month on her extraordinarily important wild sky wilderness legislation. She, of course, is joined in that by our colleague Senator Cantwell. This is going to be something of great pride to all of us in the Pacific Northwest. I congratulate Senator Murray and Senator Cantwell on their efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, though, as we deal with <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>, we also include in that legislation that I authored, referred to by Chairman Bingaman, the Park Service authority to enter into cooperative agreements to better protect the parks' natural resources. Chairman Akaka has joined me in this effort, and I commend him for all of his work to protect our treasured national parks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation also includes another bill to study the Columbia Pacific Natural Heritage Area, something that has been of great importance to local communities. It also includes important legislation for my home State to protect our water resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that our work cannot be considered done with this legislation. There is another public lands package reflecting the work of many Senators in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee which also contains a number of important pieces of legislation that have strong bipartisan support. Among those bills are two measures vitally important to the people of my home State: the Lewis and Clark Mount Hood Wilderness Act of 2007 and the Copper Salmon Wilderness Act. That is why  it is my view that the Senate should move quickly on today's legislation, <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>, and then, with the bipartisan leadership of Chairman Bingaman and Senator Domenici and colleagues on both sides of the aisle, go forward with other measures that have been, regrettably, stalled for much of this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been to the floor before to speak about the Mount Hood Wilderness Act. This is a thoroughly bipartisan piece of legislation that I and Senator Smith have worked on for many years. It passed unanimously out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Regrettably, it has been held up for many months now. Mount Hood is one of the most photographed and visited wild places in the United States. The legislation we have written to protect this icon is the result of many meetings,  scores of discussions from a diverse number of Oregonians. They are anxious to see this legislation moved forward. That is why it is so important that the Senate act after the Senate passes <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>. Countless Oregonians and other westerners have been frustrated to see all their years' efforts to enact new wilderness protections for Mount Hood, which has passed the Senate Natural Resources Committee, get stalled here on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have noted in the past, the bill to protect scenic areas as Lewis and Clark first saw them has now taken longer to get through the Senate than it took Lewis and Clark to get to Oregon. Our constituents don't understand how a bill that has such strong bipartisan support is being held up. They don't want to see it held hostage, not for partisan politics or for any other reason. They also feel that Copper Salmon is a gem that deserves protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bipartisan legislation to protect Mount Hood builds on existing Mount Hood wilderness but adds more wild and scenic rivers and provides a recreation area to allow diverse recreational opportunities. We would protect the  lower elevation forests surrounding Mount Hood and the Columbia River gorge. The protected areas include scenic vistas, almost 126,000 acres of wilderness and, in tribute to the great river-dependent journey of Lewis and Clark, the  addition of 79 miles on nine free-flowing stretchers of rivers would be added to the National Wild and Scenic River system. From what Senator Smith and I hear about our legislation and the places we have proposed for wilderness protection--and we have talked to local community leaders, to environmentalists, to timber and mining interests--we believe we have gotten this legislation right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill responds to the thousands of comments I have received on both of my previous efforts to protect Mount Hood, input at public meetings held in Oregon, and letters and phone calls. I have met with over 100 community groups and local government leaders, members of our congressional delegation, the Governor and the Bush administration. Among the comments we got was a resounding cry for additional wilderness, particularly more recreational opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are currently 189,200 acres of designated wilderness on the Mount Hood National Forest. The legislation we are talking about would increase that amount by about 126,000 new acres of wilderness. These protections, protections for such important Oregon places, should not be held up by procedural wrangling. It is one thing if there is any sense on a piece of legislation involving wilderness of significant interest groups not being consulted, not being allowed to participate. I can see every  reason to hold up that kind of legislation. But when everybody feels they have been consulted, you have complete bipartisan support from the State and the Natural Resources Committee, we ought to be in a position to move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to repeat today what I have said before: My doors are open to every Member of the Senate on this legislation and everything else. If you want to get anything important done, you have to work with colleagues. If there are additional objections to Senator Smith and me moving forward with the Mount Hood legislation, we want anybody who has an objection to come to us, because we will meet them halfway in an effort to try to address their concerns. But we have to do what Chairman</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope this legislation will pass quickly, that it will then be possible for the Senate to turn to the next public lands bill, and we will be able to adopt that swiftly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Oklahoma.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have listened patiently to what has been said. One of the things that has to be stated, if we want to change the rules of the Senate, that is fine, but it is important for the American people to know what a unanimous consent request is. This bill contains 26 separate pieces of legislation where on over four dozen of them we have had no objection whatsoever, ever. Not one time have we raised any objection. But a unanimous consent request says, No. 1, you agree with  the legislation. No. 2, you don't think it should be amended. No. 3, you don't think the Senate ought to vote on it. We have a major difference of opinion about what priorities are and what they should be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I heard the distinguished Senator from New Mexico talk about frustration. Who is watching out for the frustration a child born today, encompassing $400,000 of unfunded liabilities, is going to have when that bill comes due? Where is the worry about the frustration for future generations? People say this is noncontroversial. Let me tell you, it is controversial when you are talking about infringing on the property rights of people without their permission. That is controversial. We have a difference  of opinion on that. We think heritage areas and the disclaiming of heritage area has no impact on property rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is absolutely untrue. It does impact. Property rights are a real right guaranteed in this country. We are going to set up boards that will influence, with the money we give them, private property use and utilization without an equal influence by the private property owners. We do have a difference of opinion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of this fiscal year, September 30, the accrued actual debt on the books for this country will become $10 trillion. We are going to add $3,000--2,800 and some odd dollars--per man, woman, and child at the end of this year to the debt. People say it is noncontroversial. Four dozen of these are noncontroversial. But this idea that we have to authorize, it is either a wink and a nod, or we are totally dishonest with the American people. If we are authorizing it, we intend to spend the  money. We wouldn't be authorizing it if we didn't intend to spend the money. My objections are not that we do the right things for protecting our parks or creating the right environments in our forests and ensuring that the great treasures of our country are not protected. I want to make sure they are available. But to claim, when we have a $9 billion deficit</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are having a discussion about a small area that supposedly doesn't cost much money. It hasn't been scored, but those things in it that have been scored, it is over $350 million per year, a third of a billion dollars. What are we talking about? This debate is about whether we face up to the priorities in front of us as a nation. It is not about being against parks. It is not about being against the process. It is about making sure somebody in this body is standing up thinking about the future  finances of this country and what we are going to do to our children. This is another example of what I believe--and I know I am in the minority--is a misplaced priority. How do we justify it, when we own, as the Senator from New Mexico said, 30 percent--I thought it was 38.5 percent--of all the land in the country? When we are not taking care</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's talk about some of the issues. This is a noncontroversial bill is what we have heard. How about $2 million of our kids' money to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Robert Fulton and the Claremont? At a time when this year we are going to borrow $600 billion, we are going to spend $2 million on a celebration? Why don't we celebrate the fact that we are going to put our kids in debt more? That is what we should be celebrating, if we are so proud of this. How about $2 million to create a commission  to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the voyage of the Champlain. Do we have $2 million to throw away? We are going to throw that away on something that is not important, considering where we are in this Nation and the debt and the heritage we are going to leave our children. You bet we have a difference of opinion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people want us to start thinking in the long term, not the short term. Do we look good if we have done all these bills back home? You bet. We wink and nod and say: We are doing it. Either we are going to appropriate the money or we were dishonest with them in the first place. We are going to spend the money. How do we walk out of here and say: We got you what you wanted?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do not really intend to spend the money--unless we really do intend to spend the money, so then it really does make a difference, and we cannot maintain what we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was a very wise historian, his name was Alexander Tytler. This is attributed to him. I am not sure it is really his, but the words were spoken. They are not mine, but it is very apropos for where we are, not just on this  issue; I am not a voice of frustration just on this issue. My colleagues know that. I think it is time for us to start thinking about the long-term in this country and not the short-term politically expedience that says we look  good at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what Tytler said: A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largess from the public treasury. From that time on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits--we got you done what you want done at home; whether we can afford it or not does not matter, but we got it done--with the result that a democracy always collapses due to loose fiscal policy, always followed by  a dictatorship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the history of the world. We are contributing to our own demise as we think short-term political expediency so we can look good at home, so we can satisfy demands at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Will Durant said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A great civilization is [never] conquered from without until it has destroyed itself [from] within.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have now $79 trillion worth of unfunded liabilities that we are getting ready to lay on our kids and grandkids, and we are not thinking a thing about probably $1 billion with this bill of new additional expenditures for next year, if it gets appropriated. It is the price of doing business in Washington. We do not have that luxury anymore. We do not have the luxury of mortgaging the future of our children anymore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is the dollar at a historic low right now? Is it because we are in a slowdown or a recession? Is that it? No. It does not have anything to do with it. It has to do with the world confidence in our ability to repay our debt and the debt the rest of the world sees coming to us, which comes out to, if you were born today, $400,000 over your lifetime. Now, how many of us have children or grandchildren who could absorb just the interest on $400,000? A few, but most of us could not do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this debate is a philosophical debate. I am not worried about being a source of frustration in the Senate. I am worried about the future of our country, and if I create some scrapes and bruises on my way to wake us up to what the American people want us to do--which is think long-term, fix the structural problems, and quit pandering back to our individual desires in the State--this Congress has become a parochial Congress. It is more important to do what is right for your State than it is  for what is right for the country. How dare us. That has nothing to do with our oath. None of us has our State mentioned in the oath we take when we accept this office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are about to pass 62 pieces of legislation, none of which had a hearing until after they passed out of the committee--17 hearings post coming out of the committee. As to saying we have to meet this because it is bipartisan, it is a bipartisan failure to think about the future of this country and what is in the long-term best interests of the country, as we satisfy looking good at home to ensure our next election is put ahead of the next generation of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not going to participate in that. I am going to continue to work to make sure any piece of legislation that comes to this floor is thinking about the long-term, not the short-term. If that creates ill will among my colleagues, I apologize in advance. I would much rather be remembered as somebody who was interested in protecting the future of our children than playing nice in the Senate. As Phil Gramm said: I didn't come here to make friends, and I haven't been disappointed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The real fact is, what did we all come here for? We all came here with that in mind, to do what is best in the long-term interests of our country. It is important for us to be reminded when we are not doing that. There can be a difference of opinion about priorities. There cannot be a difference of opinion about the amount of trouble we are in. There is no difference of opinion in terms of trouble. It does not matter how we got here. The fact is, we are here. We are in trouble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How is it that we put a delegate for an island territory in this bill that has 60,000 residents that we are going to put $5.6 million into over the next 3 years? That we are going to create another delegate--what does that have to do with natural resources and lands? How did that get in here?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have added an intermodal transportation center in Trenton, ME. It authorizes the Federal Government to pay 40 percent of it, no matter what it costs. There is no limitation that this will be a competitively bid contract. No matter what it costs, we are on the hook for 40 percent of whatever it costs. And we are on the hook for 85 percent of what it will cost to run it thereafter. The only problem is, there are three other visitor centers within walking distance of this one. But we wanted to  do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could go on and on and on. The fact is, this debate is not about process. It may be to you, but it is not to me. This debate, for me, is whether we are going to change our behavior at every point to start thinking about the long-term future of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have the greatest respect for Chairman Bingaman. He has been an absolute gentleman to me in every way in every dealing. But we have a philosophical difference. He is charged to move bills out, to get things done. Most of them that have no cost he will readily agree I have had no objection to. He knows that. We have not tried to block those. But they are combined with the other bills because they know that is a force to create the votes, to get things that might be somewhat more controversial  spending. That is his job. I understand that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have no ill will toward anyone. What I have an ill will for--and when I leave the Senate, what I will take to my grave--is not being good enough to convince us to do what we swore an oath to do, and that is to think long-term, think what is best for our country, not what is best for our State; think what is best for our children, not what is best for us; think what is best for our country, not what is best for our party; think what is best for America. We are losing. Consequently, we see it  happening in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is time to really clarify what this debate is about. It is really not about a lands bill; it is about the philosophy where we continue to work and run like a loose barge in the Mississippi River that does not have a tug associated with it. Are we going to do that? Because that is what is happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One amendment I am going to be offering just says we ought to know what things cost. How much land do we have and how much does it cost to have it? We are going to have it objected to, not because it is not common sense but because we are afraid the whole package might not get accepted if something common sense is in it like knowing how much our land costs us, knowing how much land we have, having an inventory, and making a judgment, a metric about what we are doing. Nobody is thinking the big  picture. We are thinking the political picture. So here is the amendment. It is not going to go anywhere, most likely, but it absolutely makes common sense that we would do that, that we would know all the properties we own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have another amendment that is going to say that citizens have to give their approval when somebody comes onto their land who does not own their land--just basic property rights saying: If somebody is going to set up a heritage area, they ought to get permission to come onto private land, if it is your land and somebody is coming on it. We take that right away in heritage areas. It is gone. They do not have to do it. It is a commonsense amendment that says if you own land, you ought to have  the right that is guaranteed you under the Constitution to have your land protected. It is your land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have so much unwanted property where all the land agencies want a way to get rid of it, but yet they cannot. They cannot. They do not even have the money to get rid of it. So there is an amendment that says: Let's take 1 percent of the cost of this bill and allow the different agencies to get rid of the excess properties they have. It is not complicated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other thing is, we are going to offer an amendment requiring that citizens within a national heritage area are informed of the designation before it happens. If we are going to pass a law that is going to impact somebody's private property, shouldn't we tell them ahead of time? Shouldn't they have notice? Shouldn't they have the  rights guaranteed to them under the Constitution?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have spoken enough, but I think under the guise of the lands bill I have explained the real problem. There is a difference of philosophy. I will not stop fighting until we start thinking about the long-term problems facing this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will not stop objecting to spending money that we know we intend to spend. We are just playing the game that: Oh, it is not an appropriation. Well, almost 30 percent of the appropriations are not authorized. So you cannot have it both ways. A third of the money we appropriate under the appropriations process is not authorized to begin with. So authorizations actually do not mean anything, do they? Or do they? Yes, they do, because they are not going to get appropriated, or they are, and if  they are, we ought to be talking about real money that is going to be spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to talk for a minute about the backlogs in our parks because I think if the American people knew it, they would not stand for it until we did something. The National Park Service faces, right now, a $9 billion backlog. That is their number. That is not Tom Coburn's number. That is their number, a $9 billion backlog. With this legislation, they are going to take on more responsibility with no increased funds, which means the backlog is going to grow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Facilities Management Division of the National Park Service reveals there are at least 10 States where National Park Service maintenance backlogs exceed $100 million per park--$100 million per park. Twenty States have facilities with deferred maintenance exceeding $50 million. That does not include road maintenance, which is far higher. None of these numbers include the road maintenance we have not supplied the money for either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They maintain 1,466 buildings built before 1900 but do not have the money to maintain them. They have 4,975 buildings constructed before 1950 but do not have the money to maintain them. They have 2,500 fixed assets--2,500 fixed assets--they do not want but this committee will not create a way for them to get rid of. They are still spending money on 2,500 facilities--2,500 different buildings--that they do not want, that they spend money on every year, that they are not using, but they have to  keep it up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Park Service has 31 sites in California alone. They have a State backlog, in California parks alone, of $584 million, exclusive of any roadwork. California is home to many of our treasures: Yosemite, Golden Gate, Sequoia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New York national parks: They face a $347 million backlog--$347 million--home to Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty. The Statue of Liberty has a maintenance backlog of $185 million, work that needs to be done on it. We are not doing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National parks in Wyoming: a $205 million maintenance backlog. That is Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Devils Tower. Yellowstone has a $130 million backlog. It is one of our great treasured western assets. Everybody who visits there has total enjoyment from it, and yet it has a $130 million backlog which we have not addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are no increased authorizations for maintenance backlogs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Glacier National Park in Montana, a backlog of $400 million; Washington, DC, home to our monuments, a $371-million maintenance backlog; New Mexico, $41 million; Arizona, $192 million. The National Parks Conservation Association said this: The average budget shortfall among 100 park units is 32 percent. In other words, we are supplying two-thirds of what they need to maintain their parks adequately, and with this bill we are going to be adding to all that and other lands other things they are  going to have to be doing because of this bill, but we are not going to address the real needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each of the new projects in this bill will siphon funds away one way or the other, directly or indirectly, from these important projects. Are we good stewards if we add things to be stewards of when we are not caring for the things we have already?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was a wise man who once said: He who is faithful with small things will be faithful with big things. I would surmise and put forward to this body that we have not been good stewards with what we have already. Yet we are going to add to them.</paragraph>

  <narrative> (c) Use of Existing Annual Reports.--An annual report required under subsection (a) may be comprised of any annual report relating to the management of Federal real property that is published by a Federal agency.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="TITLE IX--MISCELLANEOUS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is a straightforward amendment. It requires an annual report of the Federal Government detailing the amount of property the Federal Government owns and the cost of Government and landownership to taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is just a small chart that shows the amount of land the Federal Government owns. As my colleagues can see, two-thirds of the Western United States is owned by the Federal Government in one form or another. It recognizes all of the core land, the parkland, the forest land, the heritage areas that are not--it doesn't recognize the heritage areas that we don't own, but it does recognize all the land holdings. Nobody has a metric on what we own. Not any one agency knows what we own in total,  nor does anybody know  what it costs us to own it, nor does anybody know what it costs the communities for us to own it because it has been taken off the tax rolls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, the Office of Management and Budget would be required to issue a public report detailing Federal landownership. The report would specifically include the total amount of land in the United States and the percentage that is owned by the Federal Government; the percentage of all U.S. property that is controlled by the Federal Government--not necessarily owned, but controlled--the total cost of operating and maintaining Federal real property, including land, buildings and structures;  a list of all Federal property that is unused and vacant--because why should we continue to maintain properties that are unused and vacant--including all buildings and structures; and the estimated cost of the maintenance backlog at each Federal agency with regard to their land holdings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this will do is give the taxpayers some transparency about the real nature of what we are doing. We are going down an alley blindly. We don't know what the cost is. We don't know what the total is. We certainly don't know what we are creating when we add more to it when we don't know the metrics on what we have already.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things we need is greater accountability on the maintenance. It is strange to me that we can do what we are doing with this bill and not already know this information. Why would we not know what our total land holdings are and what their costs are? There are no requirements under current law to require public disclosure of the amount of land controlled by the Federal Government or the cost of such occupation to the taxpayers. There was an Executive order issued in 2004 that would require  some of it to become publicly available, but what this amendment says is it all should be. It is an inventory. Every other organization, including the States, know what they own, and they know the cost to manage what they own. It is called management accountability. Transparency is the thing that leads to accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the President directly required the Office of Management and Budget to release a high-level report giving a picture of property ownership between 2004 and 2005, the Government decided to stop releasing the information on public domain lands. Wonder why that is. What happened is 90 percent of the lands aren't reported. So this amendment would legally require the Government to release information on all land it owns, how much it costs to maintain, and require the Government to track the growth  of Federal landownership around the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This isn't hard to do. Once you have the database, all you do is add and subtract. The first year it will be tough. Every year after that it would not be hard at all. It is a computer program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Governments track the property that individuals own. The Government therefore should disclose the same information about the land holdings that it has. The Government knows what land we own. Why shouldn't the American people know what land the Government owns? It is just common sense. If we want to manage our resources and manage our properties, then we have to know what it is and what it costs, but we don't. We don't use zero-based budgeting. Whatever they spent last year, they just ask for  more. At the end of the year, if it is not all spent, they make sure they spend it; otherwise, they are liable to get a cut. So we are not putting the money in based on what we know the need is; we are putting the money in based on a historical record that is obviously failing to maintain our national parks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will discontinue with any further debate on this amendment and yield to the chairman of the committee. I would just say commonsense knowledge about what we own and what it costs us is something the American taxpayer ought to have, and to vote against this for some reason because we can't goes back to the same philosophical argument. We are going to have the short-term excuse for the long-term problem, and we are never going to get out of this hole.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me respond on this particular amendment that the Senator from Oklahoma has presented or called up for consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment does require the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to post an annual report on the Internet that details quite a few different things. First, how much land is "within the jurisdiction of the United States;" second, how much of that land is owned by the Federal Government, both in total and on a State-by-State basis; third, a description of how much it costs to maintain all lands, buildings, and structures on an agency-by-agency basis; fourth, extensive information  on the number of unused and vacant assets and the value of operating costs for each such vacant asset; fifth, the estimated maintenance backlog of each Federal agency, presumably on these various assets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment does not just apply to national parks and national forests and reclamation projects and public domain lands which, of course, our committee would have jurisdiction of, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, but also the national wildlife refuges, Indian trust lands, GSA properties, post offices, military bases and facilities, veterans hospitals. And those, of course, are under the jurisdiction of other committees I do not serve on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To give a sense of the breadth of the amendment, the Office of Management and Budget would have to provide detailed information each year on approximately 1.2 billion real property assets worldwide and over 636 million acres of land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no provision in the amendment to exempt any sensitive information that the Department of Defense might wish to withhold or the Department of Energy or the CIA or any other agency that has a national security responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there is certainly room for improvement in Federal property management--and in that regard I agree with the Senator from Oklahoma--I do not believe we are ready to act on this amendment at this time or adopt this amendment. I believe compliance with the amendment would be very burdensome, time consuming, and expensive, and, of course, it is a responsibility that would have to be updated each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My own view is, this amendment, if proposed as a freestanding bill, would not be referred to our committee, not the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I believe it would be referred to the Homeland Security Committee because they have Government-wide responsibility. We have no idea how much cost would be involved to each agency in compiling this information for the Office of Management and Budget. I assume it would be a substantial cost, and it is not one that I think we should act upon  with this bill without any idea of that cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So my own preference, frankly, would be that if the Senator wishes to have a report such as this developed, the appropriate way to proceed would be to go to the chairman and ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, ask for a hearing on this proposal, get that committee to look seriously at what can be done to develop this kind of report, what cost is involved in developing this kind of report, whether there are needs that national security would require for putting some exemptions into  this report so that we would not be putting on the Internet information that some of our national-security-related agencies would not want posted on the Internet. That would be the approach I would urge on my colleague.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So for all of those reasons, I oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to oppose it when it comes to a vote.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma, with whom I do not agree on many things, but I know he speaks with integrity and from the heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to speak in support of <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>, the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, which we are working on. I wish to thank my colleague from New Mexico, Chairman Bingaman, and Vice Chairman Domenici for their leadership on this legislation. We have waited a long time for it. In the Senate we need to get just about everyone on board. Due to some Senators' steadfastness, including Majority Leader Reid's, we are here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All provisions of the legislation are important, but there is one provision for western New York for which we have waited a very long time, and that is the provision that would designate land at thematic sites along the entire Niagara River corridor--from Buffalo in the south to Lake Ontario in the north--as a national heritage area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Establishing this heritage area will allow us to protect the world class natural resources of Niagara Falls while promoting tourism and economic development in the region. For the first 5 years of this heritage area, a Federal commission would work to implement a management plan to capture the full benefits of the natural, historic, cultural, and recreational resources of the entire Niagara Falls region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Known the world over, Niagara Falls, of course, is a geological wonder that has drawn visitors for more than 200 years. But the region has so much more than just the profound drama of beautifully cascading waters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Niagara River corrridor has played an important role in our Nation's history. Native American culture, early European exploration, the French and Indian War, the American Revolution, the War of 1812, the Underground Railroad, and the development of hydroelectric power all have strong connections to the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the Niagara River corridor abounds with scenic beauty that offers something for recreational enthusiasts of all stripes. With numerous State parks in the area, hikers, fishermen, birders, and hunters flock to the region to enjoy its outdoor splendor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these strong assets for tourism, visitors to the U.S. side of Niagara Falls have been on the decline for several years. Too much of the New York side of the border is marked by aging infrastructure and blighted land. And all too frequently, visitors spend far more time on the Canadian side of the falls, while barely visiting the New York side. We must reverse this trend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear. The attractions and resources exist for the Niagara River corridor to become a world class destination. But the attractions it offers lack a comprehensive, unifying thread that ties the elements together in a meaningful way for the visitor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Designating the land a heritage area will help us link the existing sites of interest in a coordinated fashion, marking the region effectively, and attract more visitors. It will promote collaboration among Federal, State, and local resources and help spur investment and economic development in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say that this heritage area has been years in the making. When I first was elected to the Senate in 1999, people in Niagara Falls said we have to do something. It probably surprises my colleagues that there is virtually no Federal involvement at Niagara Falls, one of our greatest scenic wonders. We tried to figure out the way to go. Some advocated it should be a national park, and there were other things. We concluded that the heritage area is the right way to go. It will allow Federal  help to come to the region, Federal resources and experience, with planning and linking the great wonder of Niagara Falls to other historic and tourist attraction sites, but at the same time it will allow the local region to maintain control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So in 2001, at my request, the NPS reconnaissance team visited the region and recommended a congressionally authorized study be undertaken to determine the best development strategies for the area along the Niagara River. We asked them to look at the heritage area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, the National Parks Service completed that study. I thank the Park Service, because they certainly relied on local input. There was tremendous local input here, so nobody in the Niagara Falls area felt anything was being rammed down their throat. What they found--the Park Service--is strong local support for a heritage area, as well as a very great need for the resources it would offer. The report wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order for Niagara Falls to fulfill its strategic role as a key regional attraction, it is necessary for it to upgrade the visitor experience to match the expectations of 21st century travelers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That sums up the challenge we face in Niagara Falls. The study concluded that based on Niagara Falls' natural and cultural resources, the evidence of a thematic framework, the potential for effective public and private partnerships, as well as strong public support, the region met the criteria for designation as a National Heritage Area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last May, the Subcommittee on National Parks held a hearing on this issue, where I testified in support of the bill. After the hearing, we worked closely with both the National Park Service and the Energy Committee staff--whom I thank for the good work they do--to iron out the technical corrections to the bill so it could be discharged by the full committee. The heritage area has been studied now for more than 7 years. It has broad public support, and it is time for it to become law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The $10 million authorized under this act should help Niagara Falls realize a substantial return on that investment. First and foremost, any Federal expenditures will be matched by State, local, or private contributions, adding millions more to the investment in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, it is estimated that implementing the heritage area would attract 140,000 new visitors per year, and some estimates project that this would infuse up to $20 million into the local economy annually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the summer tourist season fast approaching, we are reminded that far too many visitors only view Niagara Falls from the Canadian side of the border. They have missed out on the history, culture, recreation, and natural beauty that is found in equal measure on the New York side. This legislation will take great strides in balancing that inequity and help revitalize an area of our country in need of investment and economic development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield the floor and thank my colleague for working so long and hard with us to make this legislation today a reality.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the American Farm Bureau and American farmers and ranchers had endorsed all of these amendments at an earlier time. I assume they would again, because it is the same language that was used in the past. Today, the National Taxpayers' Union endorsed these as commonsense freedoms for us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is pretty straightforward. It says that if the Government wants to take your land, you ought to be able to say, yes, I agree or you ought to be able to say no. What this bill does is it authorizes the Federal Government--they can still acquire new lands, but if it is going to have an impact on your land--not their land but your land--the citizens ought to get a vote on it. It is called real transparency in government and real participatory democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of Americans are concerned about the excessive Government influence over their land. We can say they are not, but they are. People in my State of Oklahoma, in New Mexico, New York, and every other State have great concerns about property rights. This amendment is intended to address those concerns. It simply requires the citizens affected by Federal Government land grabs, or heritage areas, or others where we are talking about private lands being impacted, to have a vote, to have a say  in the matter. It authorizes the Departments of Agriculture and Interior to continue to acquire land by purchase or exchange. It will not affect that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment would only apply to situations involving Federal eminent domain, when the Government takes property without the consent of the owner, or State and local governments cede private land to the Federal Government. The decision to cede property to the Federal Government may be voluntary by the State and local governments, but such a decision impacts the whole community. So all residents of an area, therefore, should have a voice in the decision to turn over public property that is controlled  by bureaucrats in DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do you realize that in all of our Western States, any single bureaucrat has more control in that State than the Governor of the State, where they own the majority of the land? Their implied power is greater than the highest elected official in the State. What they say goes, because it is the Federal Government. So whether it is a park ranger or forest ranger or manager of a forest or the BLM, what they say has more power than what the chief executive of any of those States says. When we look  at this, we are saying if the Federal Government is going to take something by eminent domain, the people it will impact should get a chance to say yea or nay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This goes back to the concept that we have a real right to own and hold property in this country. That is something many countries don't offer their citizens. We ought to be about protecting it at every level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would involve local residents in Government decisions about their neighborhoods and communities. Sam Adams profoundly questioned, "What liberty can there be where property is taken away without consent?" What liberty is there when your property is taken away without consent or impacted without your consent or your zoning ordinance, because some bureaucracy from Washington funded through a heritage area decided what the zoning ordinances are going to be and has millions of dollars  to move it, to your detriment, the private owner of property. What liberty is there when property rights are taken away? This amendment ensures both liberty and consent. It is very straightforward. It doesn't affect Federal transportation projects, national defense, or homeland security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Delegating property decisions is not unusual. Eminent domain has been exercised through both legislation and legislative delegation. It is usually delegated to another government body. But the power may be delegated to private corporations, as we saw in Connecticut, such as public utilities, railroads, and bridge companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment will delegate the final decision to the property holders who are being impacted--real property rights. If we agree as a majority, it happens; if we disagree, it doesn't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Supreme Court has approved the widespread use of the power of eminent domain in conjunction with private companies to facilitate urban renewal, for low-cost housing, for deteriorated housing, and the promotion of values, as well as economic development. In Berman v. Parker, a unanimous Court observed:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The concept of the public welfare is broad and inclusive. The values it represents are spiritual as well as physical, aesthetic, as well as monetary. It is within the power of the legislature to determine that the community should be beautiful as well as healthy, spacious, as well as clean, well-balanced, as well as carefully patrolled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This ever-expanding government power essentially allows Congress and unelected bureaucrats for any reason to take private property from citizens with little, if any, recourse. What liberty when property rights are not preserved?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is designed to provide some check on the ever-growing expansion on private property rights within this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="TITLE IX--MISCELLANEOUS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me speak briefly in opposition to this amendment and explain my understanding of it. This amendment prohibits the three agencies, the Department of Interior, Department of Energy, and the Forest Service, from assuming control--that is the phrasing in the amendment--over any parcel of land except through a voluntary exchange, unless the citizens of the political subdivision in which the parcel is located approve the assumption of control by referendum. Even if  the assumption of control by the agency is approved by a referendum, that approval terminates at the end of 10 years, unless there is another referendum that extends it beyond 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems likely to me that the amendment would affect more than just the acquisition of fee title to land. It appears to include the interests in lands, such as rights of way, easements, possibly water rights, taking lands into trust for Indian tribes, and perhaps even friendly condemnations for public purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I read the amendment, since the only exception is for voluntary exchanges of property, I would think the sale of property--if one of these agencies wants to buy the land and a private landowner wants to sell the land to the agency, it would have to be approved by referendum. The amendment would give counties and communities, political subdivisions, veto authority over any Federal land ownership by these three agencies. I think it would frustrate congressional efforts to purchase or protect  lands to make it virtually impossible to provide for any long-term Federal management or protection, such as is attempted in our national parks and monuments, wildlife refuges, historic sites, and wilderness areas. The amendment would adversely impact much more than land designated for conservation purposes. It would also impact Bureau of Reclamation dams, reservoirs, energy pipelines, and DOE facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the concept of having to do another referendum every 10 years--I don't know how that would work, frankly. I don't know what would happen if you lose. Suppose the Federal Government goes ahead and acquires land through whatever means for a reservoir. At the end of the 10 years, there has to be another referendum on whether the Federal Government should maintain that land for that reservoir. If the referendum fails, I don't know what we would do with that reservoir at that point. There  is not much of a private market for reservoirs. I don't know what action the Government would be expected to take at that point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For a variety of reasons, I do not think this is a workable amendment, and it is one I urge my colleagues to oppose.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Purpose: To ensure that all individuals who reside, or own property that is located, in a proposed National Heritage Area are informed of the designation of the National Heritage Area)</narrative>
  <narrative> On page 203, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:</narrative>
  <narrative>Subtitle G--Notification and Consent Requirements Relating to National Heritage Areas</narrative>
  <narrative>SEC. 491 NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Secretary of the Interior shall not approve a management plan for a National Heritage Area designated by this title unless the local coordinating entity of the proposed National Heritage Area provides written notification through the United States mail of the designation to each individual who resides, or owns property that is located, in the proposed National Heritage Area.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 492. WRITTEN CONSENT REQUIREMENT.</narrative>
  <narrative> With respect to each National Heritage Area designated by this title, no employee of the National Park Service or member of the local coordinating entity of the National Heritage Area (including any designee of the National Park Service or the local coordinating entity) may enter a parcel of private property located in the proposed National Heritage Area without the written consent of the owner of the parcel of property.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is another straightforward, what I believe most Americans would agree with, commonsense amendment. It says citizens within a national heritage area are informed of the designation and that governing officials must receive permission to enter private property. It is simple.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I am in a heritage area, what happens often now is those who are empowered by the heritage area stake and survey your land, do all these things without your permission to enter your land--your land, not their land, your land. What we do is we broadly give the ability to violate property rights through the heritage area laws so people can access private property without permission. If I am wrong about that, then this amendment would cause absolutely no harm. But the fact is, I am right about  it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment reestablishes the right of private property owners to control who goes on their land, when they go on their land, and what they are doing with their land. It reaffirms that if you have ownership, it is your land, and it does not take that right of a property owner away because it happens to be in a heritage area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More and more heritage area designations are being made with little knowledge of the landowners involved. <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> establishes three new heritage areas and extends the authorization and funding of several existing national heritage areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no requirement for the Federal Government to notify the individual within the area of its designation or its meaning. If we are going to have national heritage areas--and I agree at points they are great--do we not have an obligation to tell the landowner their land is getting ready to be subjected to all the parameters associated with a national heritage area? Do we not have the right and the obligation to ensure their property rights are protected as they are brought into a national  heritage area?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the Constitution says we ought to do this, we ought to restore what was already there. What is liberty without the rights of property?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the remainder of my time on this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Mexico.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me speak in opposition to this amendment as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would establish new restrictions for the three national heritage areas that are designated in this bill. It would prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from approving a management plan for a heritage area unless the local coordinating entity, which is usually a nonprofit group that is promoting tourism in this heritage area and developing the management plan, has provided written notification to each individual residing or owning property there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment also prohibits employees of the National Park Service or the local coordinating entity, usually the nonprofit group, from entering any private property within the heritage area without the written consent of the property owner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment, in my view, fails to understand what the designation of a heritage area means. Let me read some boilerplate language we put in every one of these national heritage area bills. It says in the bill, and we have this three times in this legislation because there are three heritage areas: Nothing in the subtitle abridges the rights of any property owner, including the right to refrain from participating in any plan, project, program or activity conducted within the heritage area. Nothing  in the subtitle requires any property owner to permit public access to the land. Nothing in the title alters any duly adopted land use regulation. Nothing in the title authorizes or implies the reservation or appropriation of any water or water rights. Nothing in the title creates any liability, affects any liability under any other law of any private property owner with respect to any person injured on private property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is substantial confusion, I believe, about the idea that there is some great decrement of private property rights by the designation of these heritage areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The prohibition against employees of the National Park Service or coordinating entity from being able to enter private property without written permission of the landowner does not make sense, in my opinion. Heritage areas do not involve acquisition of Federal land. The amendment applies to any private land within large areas of the State. We have one in northern New Mexico which I was urged to try to establish--and we were able to establish it--by people who wanted to  promote  tourism in northern New Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this language, a member of the Park Service or the coordinating entity would not be able to go to a mall or a restaurant or go to any other private property in northern New Mexico in a three-county area without written consent of the landowner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my view, the amendment should be defeated, and I urge my colleagues to vote against it when the time comes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>James Burling, principal property rights attorney for the Pacific Legal Foundation:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The so-called protections for private property are largely symbolic; so long as regulators can browbeat landowners into becoming "willing sellers" we will continue to see the erosion of fee simple property ownership in rural America. With the influx of federal funding, the regulatory pressure on landowners to sell will, in many cases, be insurmountable. The legacy we will leave to future generations will not be the preservation of our history, but the preservation of a facade masquerading as  our history subverted by the erosion of the rights that animated our history for the first two centuries of the Republic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joe Waldo, president of the Virginia property rights law firm Waldo and Lyle, said this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before Congress has nothing to do with a "heritage trail" but will result in a "trail of tears" for those least able to stand up for their property rights. This is no more than an effort to overreach by the federal Government with regulations that will restrict homeowners, farmers and small business people in the use of their property.</paragraph>

  <narrative>"The bill before Congress has nothing to do with a `heritage trail' but will result in a `trail of tears' for those least able to stand up for their property rights. This is no more than an effort to over reach by the federal Government with regulations that will restrict homeowners, farmers and small business people in the use of their property.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Traditionally the elderly, minorities and the poor are most impacted by regulatory measures that restrict property owners in the use of their land. Protecting our heritage is a noble ambition, however these matters need to be handled at the local level by those closest to the issues at hand. It is important that the fundamental right of private property not be threatened by more misguided federal legislation."</narrative>
  <narrative>(3) R.J. Smith, recognized property rights expert and senior fellow at the National Center for Public Policy Research, said:</narrative>
  <narrative>"The name itself for this National Heritage Area raises serious questions. It seems improper, even indecent, to name this the Hallowed Ground corridor and claim it is to `appreciate, respect and experience this cultural landscape that makes it uniquely American' when it tramples on the very principles of private property rights, individual liberty and limited government that the Founding Fathers risked and gave their lives for. Lincoln himself reminded us in the Gettysburg Address that `we cannot  dedicate--we cannot consecrate--we cannot hallow this ground.' He reminded us that we must be dedicated to see that this `new nation' `conceived in liberty' had `a new birth of freedom' and did `not perish from the Earth.' Rejecting the very principles of the Founding Fathers that created our liberty and freedom is not a journey any free person should want to undertake.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Any legitimate effort to attract tourism to old homes and mansions and to quaint little country main streets should properly be done privately and voluntarily by chambers of commerce, booster groups, and preservationist organizations. Not by the compulsory diktat of the National Park Service, the U.S. Congress, and anti-growth Greens. If you want to attract visitors try billboards, not federal force."</narrative>
  <narrative>(4) And as Dr. Roger Pilon, director of the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, notes:</narrative>
  <narrative>"There's nothing wrong with historic preservation--in fact, it's commendable--but it's got to be done the right way. However worthy your ends, when you prohibit people from using their property as they would otherwise have a perfect right to do, you've got to pay them for their losses. Indeed, it is not a little ironic to simply take those historic rights in the name of historic preservation."</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, here is what I would say in response to the chairman's comment. It is not unreasonable to have somebody who does not own your land, has no real business on your land, ask permission to come on your land. That is an absolute subrogation of the rights guaranteed under the Constitution which we are now embracing and say it is fine to not have to get permission. That is not what comes with property rights under the Constitution. If our defense is we do not believe in the  Constitution and the rights of private property rights, then I would say we are misguided in what we are doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a simple way of saying, if we are going to have heritage areas and if I am a private property owner in a heritage area and you want to come on my property and survey, you ought to have to get my permission. You should not be able to come on my land without permission to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, example after example--and I will submit additionally an article from the Nation magazine on examples of exactly what happens in heritage areas to private property rights. It is called "An Ugly Heritage." I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this article.</paragraph>

  <narrative>An Ugly Heritage--The Poor Man's National Park; The Citizen's Burden</narrative>
  <narrative>(By John J. Miller)</narrative>
  <narrative>A few years ago, Lee Ott was driving around his vegetable farm in Yuma, Ariz., when he spotted a crew of surveyors putting stakes in his land. "I stopped and asked them what was going on," he recalls. It turned out they were marking the boundaries of the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area. Ott's farm fell entirely within its 22 square miles, and nobody had bothered to tell him. "I became worried because I wanted to build a new house and a shop on the farm," he says. "I didn't need anybody  to give me a bunch of rules about how they should look or whether I could even build them."</narrative>
  <narrative>So he decided to fight back. He met with the Yuma County Farm Bureau, which then contacted all of the landowners within the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area. "About 600 people came to our meeting," says Harold Maxwell, a farm-equipment distributor. "When I asked for a show of hands from those who knew they were in the NHA, only one hand went up."</narrative>
  <narrative>National Heritage Areas are like a poor man's National Park--they aren't actually owned by the federal government, but they're zoned by it. Instead of employing Park Rangers in stiff-brimmed hats, they're often administered by liberal groups that want to weaken the property rights of the people who hold a piece of land within or even near NHA boundaries. This is generally done in the name of historic preservation and environmental conservation. The Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area, for instance,  includes an old territorial prison and some wetlands along the Colorado River. Yet NHAs are perhaps best regarded as a clever combination of pork-barrel spending and land-use regulations--and they're an increasingly popular tool for slow-growth activists who bristle at the thought of economic development that they don't personally control.</narrative>
  <narrative>Since the first NHA was created in 1984 to preserve a 61-mile canal that runs between Lake Michigan and the Illinois River, more than three dozen have come into existence. Today, they're a growth industry: Ten were added in 2006 alone, and last fall, the House of Representatives passed a $135 million bill that swould set up six more. Some, such as the one in Yuma, are just dots on the map. Others are sprawling. The Tennessee Civil War National Heritage Area takes up the entire state.</narrative>
  <narrative>"These are basically federal zoning laws," says Peyton Knight of the National Center for Public Policy Research, a free-market think tank that has tried to draw attention to the problem. The rules governing NHAs vary from place to place, but they tend to have a few features in common. One important element is the involvement of a "management entity" that works in conjunction with the Park Service to come up with a plan--in the case of one NHA, this means creating an "inventory" of properties  of "national historic significance" that it wants "preserved," "managed," or "acquired."</narrative>
  <narrative>Sometimes the ambitions of an NHA amount merely to a bit of parkland pump-priming. The website of the Rivers of Steel NHA near Pittsburgh boasts that it "is spearheading a drive" to have the National Park Service absorb an old steel mill and mentions a bill in Congress. So it's a federally funded organization that lobbies Washington for ever more subsidies.</narrative>
  <narrative>But does the National Park Service really need more parks? It already operates almost 400 sites. Although some remain incredibly popular, visits within the system have declined in the last decade--a trend that started before the terrorist attacks of 9/11 resulted in fewer foreign visitors. What's more, the Department of the Interior is having trouble maintaining the properties it already runs. Its maintenance backlog is a multibillion-dollar wish list of unfunded repairs and improvements. The  National Parks Conservation Association, a non-profit group, says that the parks need an extra $800 million per year just to fund their existing operations adequately. This certainly isn't the result of a Scrooge-like Bush administration: The Park Service is spending more money per visitor, per acre, and per employee than ever before.</narrative>
  <narrative>Supporters of NHAs insist that they aren't in the business of buying or regulating property, which is true in the sense that NHAs do neither of these things directly. But they work to achieve these results indirectly, by encouraging local governments to implement restrictive land-use plans. "That's how they achieve their goals--by pushing counties and towns to do what they can't do for themselves," says Cheryl Chumley, a Virginia writer who has tracked NHAs.</narrative>
  <narrative>They do this by dangling the prospect of federal largesse in front of potential recipients. West Virginia's Wheeling NHA, which is basically a downtown preservation project, makes this explicit, according to a Heritage Foundation report by Chumley and Ron Ott. Its management plan calls for new zoning ordinances and the acquisition of private property. And how will it achieve these goals? As Chumley and Ott write, "Major funding to support the activities ..... and the recommendations of this  plan will be coming from the National Park Service." In the year prior to its most recent available tax filing, the Wheeling NHA received more than $2.5 million in government contributions--and not a dime from private sources.</narrative>
  <narrative>One of the most controversial NHAs is the proposed Journey Through Hallowed Ground, which would encompass a corridor roughly 175 miles in length between Charlottesville, Va., and Gettysburg, Pa. The exact boundaries aren't determined because this NHA at least technically remains on the drawing board. But that didn't stop Congress in 2005 from giving a $1 million earmark to the Journey Through Hallowed Ground Partnership, a non-profit group that's pushing for the NHA. The organization's board  is full of slow-growthers, including Peter Brink, the senior vice president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. "If this NHA becomes a reality, it would essentially deputize the National Trust and its allies to oversee land-use policy in the whole region," says Knight.</narrative>
  <narrative>Once upon a time, historic-preservation groups operated public-education programs and tried to save old homes and hotels, often by purchasing them. Nowadays, however, they're much more interested in regulating land that they don't own. In Oregon and Washington state, where property-rights advocates have put forth ballot initiatives to compensate landowners when government regulations lower the value of their property, the National Trust has campaigned to defeat them. It even worked to derail  a transportation project in Virginia because a proposed road expansion would have increased traffic near the Chancellorsville battlefield--not in it, just near it. Three years ago, Emily Wadhams of the National Trust testified to Congress that "private-property rights have never been allowed to take precedence over our shared national values and the preservation of our country's heritage."</narrative>
  <narrative>Last October, the Journey Through Hallowed Ground Partnership issued a report on how it would pursue its objectives in an NHA: "Farmland, in particular, is a threatened resource. . . . There are many opportunities to further protect these resources through conservation easements, Rural Historic District designations, Agricultural and Forestal districts, and private and public easement and land acquisition." Except for easements, in which landowners sell certain rights to their land, each of  these suggestions would amount to having government agencies tell property holders what they can do--or, more likely, what they can't do. In September, more than 110 groups, including the American Conservative Union, the Family Research Council, and Freedom Works, signed a letter urging Congress to reject new NHAs.</narrative>
  <narrative>Backers of Journey Through Hallowed Ground, including Republican congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia, cite a poll to claim that the public is behind them. What they don't reveal is something that the Fauquier Times-Democrat, a local newspaper, uncovered: The poll was sponsored by a group that endorses, the NHA, and 96 percent of the people in the survey didn't even know what the NHA is.</narrative>
  <narrative>That's what happened in Yuma, Ariz.: Congress created the Yuma Crossing NHA, and hardly any of the locals knew about it until Lee Ott saw the surveyors on his property. The good news is that, Yuma's farmers fought back--they'asked members of Arizona's congressional delegation to intervene, and eventually the NHA was downsized dramatically. Today, it covers only, four square miles. Threats loom elsewhere, however, and an exhibit on the Yuma County Farm Bureau's experience will be featured at this  year's American Farm Federation Bureau convention.</narrative>
  <narrative>Although Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson, is run by a private group rather than the federal government, supporters of the Journey Through Hallowed Ground like to mention that the boundaries of their NHA would include it. They would do well to read Jefferson's words, and in particular a line that their foes enjoy quoting: "The true foundation of republican government is the equal right of every citizen in his person and property and in their management."</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, before we leave this amendment, I wish to make one more point. I read the language that is in the bill in each of these heritage area provisions that says there is nothing that prohibits or restricts the right of the landowner to deny access to his or her private property. That is the case under State property law in every State in the Union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I own a piece of property, if I am a private landowner and I don't want people coming on the land, I have the right to deny them access on my land. That includes Federal officials, surveyors, anybody I want to deny the right to come on my land. There is nothing in our legislation that in any way changes that.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment requires 1 percent of the new spending authorized in this bill to be used to dispose of excess, unused, and unneeded Federal property to offset some of the cost of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we know is we have a tremendous backlog in our parks. We have a tremendous backlog in almost every land ownership we have. We have tremendous maintenance needs in the Forest Service and tremendous maintenance needs in BLM. We are suffering to care for what we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All this amendment says is take 1 percent--they listed 6,500 different  items they want to get rid of--and use the money to help them get rid of them so they do not continue to spend money maintaining what they don't want and don't need. At a minimum, this bill authorizes $380 million of new spending, which only represents a fraction when we actually see what will happen. We will track this. My staff will track the actual spending that comes out of this  bill in terms of appropriations so we will have it for historical reference. My amendment says to take 1 percent for use to get rid of these items and then take them away. When we have gotten rid of the excess items, we would not use the money to do that and that money will go to maintain the public parks we all value so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will help offset the hundreds of millions of dollars of new spending in the 2,000 property assets that in the Park Service alone have been slated for disposal but cannot be sold off solely due to the lack of funding to get rid of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So all this does is it directs some authorization and says: Park Service, take these 2,000 things, here is some money, get rid of them--the things you want to get rid of. And everybody agrees we should get rid of them. They haven't because they don't have the money because they have to go through all these various steps under the Federal Government's property rights legislation. But we say to them: Here is the money, so you don't continue to spend money on that, and instead you continue to spend  money against this $9 billion backlog in our national parks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this does is it allows them to get rid of assets they no longer need. This gives them a way and the funds to do that. It allows them to truly dispose of what they want to dispose of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Mexico.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="TITLE IX--DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN FUNDS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me speak briefly on this amendment and in opposition to this amendment as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment provides 1 percent of all amounts made available to the Secretary of the Interior to carry out the various provisions of the legislation--that is to the 60-some odd bills that are included here--beginning in 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, be made available to the Director of the Park Service to dispose of assets described in the candidate asset disposition list. This is a list of structures the Park Service intends to demolish or to dispose of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the description the Senator from Oklahoma made contemplated the sale of property. The truth is this is a list the Park Service keeps of buildings they no longer want to maintain. They wish to dispose of these, in the sense of destroying them, or tearing them down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment is essentially a tax on future appropriations for all of the programs in this package to pay for a specific asset disposal program of one agency within the Department of the Interior. Many of the programs authorized in this legislation have nothing to do with the National Park Service. It makes no sense, in my view, to reduce amounts appropriated for various unrelated programs and to other agencies, especially when the Park Service has never identified funding of its asset disposal  program as a problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year we get a budget from the Department of Interior. They have never requested specific funds for this purpose. Instead, they use their regular construction funding to destroy property, to destroy these buildings when they determine that is a priority for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment, of course, in my view also impinges upon the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee. I am not on the committee, my colleague Senator Domenici is, but we are essentially saying here that all future appropriations that relate to bills that are part of this legislation shall be taxed by 1 percent for this other purpose. That seems to me an unusual way for the Congress to begin undermining, through an authorizing bill, the appropriations that otherwise should be made  by the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to oppose the legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have not had a chance to speak on the bill. If I could--I understand we may be delaying the votes because of other reasons. If I could get 12 minutes to speak, after Senator Domenici, on the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="TITLE IX--DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN FUNDS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, first, I want to say to the Senator from Oklahoma that I have nothing but respect for him, and we have talked about the profession he practiced before he was a Senator, saving lives and being a doctor. But I do want to say that I wholeheartedly disagree with his approach to these bills and to what the Senator is doing in the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in producing these bills for a vote. I think the Senator is wrong. I hope the Senate understands what  he is doing, and I think if they do, they could each say to him: We appreciate what you are trying to do, but it is the wrong way to do it. It won't work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if you talk to Senators about what is going on in the Senate, I think most of them will tell you today that the Senate is borderline dysfunctional. We can't get things done. There are too many nuances that have been imposed upon us that we didn't know when we were putting them on that they were going to run us in all different directions, but we are there. So we can hardly get things done. It is kind of a dysfunctional body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along comes a bright Senator, and here is a package of bills, and so he looks at them and says: Oh my, this is a way to show I am going to save money. Well, Senator, you have the wrong package of bills. You have got the wrong package of bills. There will be plenty of opportunity for you to save the taxpayers money. Every appropriations bill or facsimile thereof--supplemental--put them together, 10 in 1 or one at a time, but plenty of opportunity for you to save money by attacking pieces of the  appropriations bills. That is how you save money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And for all those who are watching the good Senator from Oklahoma, all they have to do is say: Senator, we think you are on the right track, go after the appropriations bills. I am not asking you to, because I am an appropriator, but I am telling you if you want to save money for the taxpayers, that is what you should do, and there is plenty of  opportunity.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator's time has expired.</chair>

    <paragraph>I had intended to ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes. Did I not get it?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <chair>The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="TITLE IX--DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN FUNDS">
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, Senator, if you want to save the taxpayers money, then go after the place where the money is that is about to break your country, and that is the entitlements for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. If you want to save your taxpayers from ruination, then get involved in reforming those programs so they do not make us go broke. Anybody who knows about your government will tell you, dear Senator, if that is what you want to do, DOMENICI is right, go after appropriations; that  is where money is spent. Go after entitlements; that is where money is spent that is going to break your country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And to prove to you that this bill does not spend money, all I can do is do it the way the Senate does it and ask the Congressional Budget Office: How much do these bills cost the taxpayers? Senator Bingaman, you asked that, and I don't know whether you already said it, but I am going to repeat it. This is Senator Bingaman's letter. He asked the Congressional Budget Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we have to have institutions that take care of things, don't we? The Congressional Budget Office, not the Senator from Oklahoma, is charged with evaluating a bill and telling us about it. You know what they told us about this bill? Not only does it not  cost money, it makes money. This bill will bring into the Treasury in the next 4 years $48 million, because we have authorized the disposition of a couple of boats that were under lease. We said:  Okay, go ahead and buy them, and they gave us the money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So contrary to all the debate about costing money, and the taxpayers going broke, the bill makes money. Now, you can say: Oh no, it doesn't, I have another way of figuring it out. That is what the Senator says. But we can't have another way to do everything around here, another way to figure out what bills cost. We already have enough ways to figure them out, and they have got us so confused with what we have that we don't need any more. But if the Senator thinks he has a new one, and that is  to delay this bill and take a piece of it and talk about it and say it is a bad piece that doesn't make sense, that is fine. But don't say you have a new way to protect the great public of America from overspending and that is to take after a lands bill full of authorization that nobody heretofore has thought of taking on for appropriations purposes, because it doesn't appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The good Senator is phenomenal. He is a phenomenon. But he isn't so great that of all the time in history we have had to look at these land bills nobody has said: We are going to follow each one and see how much it costs. That is one of his amendments, to follow its cost into government. You know what that means? It means there is a whole new set of books we have to set up. His approach will cost more money and wreak more havoc if we have to do that--find out how much they cost, even if he does  them himself, as he suggested. He is going to see how much these authorizations cost, if anything, as they reach fruition--if they do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, having said that, each and every one of the amendments offered by the Senator is very erudite. They lend themselves to discussion and debate. But every one of them, Mr. President and fellow Senators, every one of the amendments is so complicated, so full of contortions and turning the government this way and that way, that they ought to at least have a hearing. They haven't had a hearing. They shouldn't be adopted on this bill, where we have carefully had hearings on the bill, had votes  on the bill, with 23 Senators participating before we put them in this package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should not put these four new ones on, one of which has to do with local government approving the acquisition of property by the Federal Government for parks. Before you can sell your property to the government, local government has to take a vote, and then 10 years later they have to take another vote to see if they were right. Do you understand, in the argument for simplicity of government, for making sure everybody can have their way, we have made government more complex by these amendments  than anybody could ever imagine?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, for one, say my hat is off to the Senator. I hope he finds a new approach, something new to attack to save money, but not a group of lands bills that are authorization bills only, that we have been told by the Congressional Budget Office will cost nothing in the way we handle bills here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if you want to change the way and have a new way to figure out how much bills cost, then we will have to have a long debate on which way we are going to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senate for listening, and I thank the Senate for yielding me some time, and I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for letting me speak as long as I have.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="TITLE IX--DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN FUNDS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to amendment No. 4519 offered by my distinguished colleague from Oklahoma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment mandates a 1 percent across-the-board redirection of funds each year from all amounts appropriated to programs in this bill for the sole and specific purpose of removing assets--mostly old buildings and facilities--from Park Service operated lands that are determined to be surplus to need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This 1 percent "off the top" charge has the effect of setting the disposal of National Park Service surplus assets above all other programs that are in this bill. In essence, it ties the hands of the appropriations committee to determine what amounts should be devoted to the disposal of Park Service surplus facilities each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, there is no connection between the wide variety of programs and projects that are in this public lands bill, and would be assessed this 1 percent charge, and the need to remove old buildings from parks. Put simply, this amendment does not make good sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the ranking member of the Interior Appropriations subcommittee that provides the funding for the Park Service, I simply can't support such a proposal. It is up to the Appropriations Committee to review the agency's budget each year and set the appropriate funding levels for the various activities of the Service, including the disposal of surplus facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Budget priorities change each year based on many factors, including the shifting needs of the agencies and the amount of money we have to work with under the budgetary caps set by Congress. That is why we have an annual appropriations process to weigh these variables.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To transfer 1 percent of funds appropriated under this act for one purpose forevermore takes away the Appropriation Committee's discretion, and indeed, its obligation to set priorities each year for the needs of our Nation's parks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, the Interior subcommittee provided the National Park Service nearly $1 billion to address maintenance and construction needs. I believe these funds are sufficient to allow the Park Service to address the most critical maintenance requirements including the removal of unneeded assets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the chairman and ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources committee and oppose this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the Congressional Budget Office dated January 31, 2008.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>U.S. CONGRESS,</narrative>
  <narrative>CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, January 31, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR: This letter responds to your request for information on the estimated discretionary costs of <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill>, the National Forests, Parks, Public Land, and Reclamation Projects Authorization Act of 2007, as introduced on December 13, 2007. Because the bill was not reported from committee (the point at which we typically prepare estimates), CBO has not prepared a complete cost estimate for <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill>; we transmitted a table showing the direct spending and revenue effects of the bill  to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on January 24, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>Although we have not completed our analysis of <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill>, we have previously completed cost estimates for bills (mostly in the House) that authorize projects similar or identical to nearly all of those authorized by <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill>. The estimated discretionary costs contained in those previous estimates totaled nearly $320 million over five years, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. That figure is a reasonable approximation of the potential discretionary costs of <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill>.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="2877">S2877</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>If you wish further details about <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill> or our previous estimates, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Deborah Reis.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Peter R. Orszag,</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="TITLE IX--DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN FUNDS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this letter shows a cost of $320 million for these bills over the next 5 years. So this is the Congressional Budget Office. This isn't my paper, this is theirs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will spend a few minutes, and then I will yield back my time because I know people want to get to some votes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="TITLE IX--DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN FUNDS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="TITLE IX--DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN FUNDS">
    <paragraph>Absolutely.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="TITLE IX--DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN FUNDS">
    <paragraph>Doesn't that letter say "if appropriated"?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="TITLE IX--DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN FUNDS">
    <paragraph>Assuming appropriation. Yes, it does.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="TITLE IX--DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN FUNDS">
    <paragraph>That means if it is not appropriated, it doesn't cost anything.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="TITLE IX--DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN FUNDS">
    <paragraph>If it is not appropriated. But we are not passing these bills under the assumption they are not going to be appropriated. We are passing these bills under the assumption they will be appropriated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a matter of fact, the promise is made as we pass this. And either it is a hollow promise you are sending back home so you can say, yes, I did this, and lie to your constituents, or we are going to appropriate the money. It is one or the other. So either we are dishonest with whom we are telling we are doing something for or we absolutely intend to appropriate it. There isn't any other option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will finish up by saying this. Obviously, the senior Senator from New Mexico did not hear my earlier comments. We are in tremendous economic straits in the long term. This debate is not about the lands bill. It is about will we change the philosophy, will we honor our oath, and will we start doing what is right in the long term for those who come after us. The heritage we have embraced in this country is one of sacrifice--one generation sacrifices so the next has opportunity. If we keep doing  this without regard--we don't know how much we are spending; we don't know how much the monthly costs are; we are not taking care of the parks as we should because we do not have an idea; we have a hodgepodge; we have a barge floating down the river without a tug on it--we are going to make the problem worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Am I frustrating the Senators from New Mexico? You bet. Are our children worth it? You bet. I am not going to stop. I am going to stand and say we are going to think long term, we are going to start protecting property rights, we are going to start thinking about our children, and we are not going to give up because we get lectured because we are not doing it the way we have always done it. The way we have always done it has us bankrupt. It is time for a change. Republicans and Democrats alike,  our children are worth it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, today, I express my support of <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>, the Consolidated Natural Resources Act. I commend the chair and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for their leadership and the work of their staff on this important legislation. This bill represents a bicameral-and-bipartisan supported package of bills. It has many good initiatives that demonstrate our commitment to be responsible stewards of our national treasures and historic sites. The  legislation also has targeted provisions that address unique circumstances and issues occurring in the Pacific region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I express my support for titles VII and VIII of <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> that relate to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, CNMI, and the Freely Associated States, the Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CNMI is a group of islands located east of the Philippines and south of Japan. Following World War II, the United States administered the islands under a United Nations trusteeship. In 1975, the people of the CNMI voted for a political union with the United States. The 1976 covenant enacted by Congress gave U.S. citizenship to CNMI residents and extended most U.S. laws to the CNMI. However, the covenant exempted the CNMI from U.S. immigration law. As a result of the CNMI's policies, today  the population has increased fivefold, from 16,000 to 80,000. This growth has made both U.S. citizens, and the indigenous people of the islands, minorities in their own communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation meets the Federal Government's interest in further implementation of the covenant, securing our borders, and in the establishment of stable immigration and labor policies on which the CNMI can build its future. The provisions included in title VII are identical to those passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on December 11, 2007. As the sponsor of the companion CNMI bill, I am pleased to report the CNMI provisions contained in <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> are sensitive to the special circumstances  and to the current economic downturn in the CNMI. The legislation provides a basis to transition the CNMI to Federal immigration laws, while protecting the local economy. These provisions are crucial to address the immigration abuses that have persisted in the CNMI for the past 20 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, I am particularly pleased to join Senator Wyden in including a provision on cooperative agreements that will protect the natural resources on our national parks. Title III of <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> will give the Secretary of the Interior the authority to enter agreements with Federal, public, nonprofit organizations, and even private landowners to protect our coasts, wetlands, and watersheds contained within and outside of national park boundaries.  This act supports collaborative efforts that will greatly benefit generations of park visitors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as important as having cooperative agreements is the ability of these entities to work together and use them to combat the spread of invasive species. Invasive species are one of the greatest threats to our natural and cultural heritage. Invasive species are the primary cause of decline in Hawaii's threatened and endangered species, and cause hundreds of millions of dollars in damages to Hawaii's agricultural industry, tourism, real estate, and water quality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One very successful public-private partnership in my State is occurring at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the island of Hawaii. The Ola'a-Kilauea Partnership is a cooperative land management effort involving State and Federal entities and willing private landowners. This partnership has jointly fenced 14,100 acres on State and private lands and eliminated the feral pig population from 9,800, while also controlling feral pigs in an additional 4,300 acres.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are other examples, such as efforts on the island of Maui. I am proud to mention the work of the Maui Invasive Species Committee, which brings together the resources of individuals, and the Federal and State governments to collaborate and combat invasive species. One of the barriers they have faced in the past is the inability to spend Federal funds on projects that treat invasive species on lands adjacent to national park borders, where there is a clear and direct benefit to parks. This  bill will provide the necessary authorization to support such efforts. This is especially vital as such cooperative agreements focus cooperative action to reduce invasive species on our national parks and other lands across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cooperative agreement provisions of Title III provide a very important step in controlling invasive species that are crossing geographic and jurisdictional boundaries. Land managers and other involved governments and organizations will have another tool to help address their invasive species management issues. Also it will allow the Secretary of the Department of Interior to protect park resources through collaborative efforts in lands within and outside of National Park System units.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand in strong support for the Consolidated Natural Resources Act. I encourage my colleagues to join in keeping our precious national resources and historic sites available for future generations, as well as meeting the needs of the Pacific region.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate passed the Cesar Estrada Chavez Study Act of 2007, which was included as part of the larger public lands package, <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>. The bill would authorize the National Park Service to study whether any of the sites significant to Chavez's life meet the criteria for being listed on the National Register of Historic Landmarks. The goal of the study is to establish a foundation for future legislation that would then designate appropriate sites  for national historic landmark status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the 107th Congress, I've worked to pass the Cesar Chavez study language. It has received an overwhelming positive response, not only from my fellow Arizonans, but from Americans all across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cesar Chavez was a humble man of deep conviction who understood what it meant to serve and sacrifice for others. Honoring the places of his life will enable his legacy to inspire and serve as an example for our future leaders. It is important that we remember his struggle and do what we can to preserve appropriate landmarks that are significant to his life.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, today the Senate takes an important step forward in celebrating and commemorating one of our Nation's most important emblems and historic periods. Included in the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 is legislation that I authored, the Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail Act. I am proud to be joined by cosponsors of the original bill, including Senators Mikulski, Warner, Webb, and Kennedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This land and water trail of almost 300 miles covers parts of Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia to commemorate the events leading up to the writing of the "Star-Spangled Banner" during the Chesapeake Campaign of the War of 1812.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The trail traces the following major events: the arrival of the British fleet on the Patuxent River; the landing of the British forces in Benedict, MD; the sinking of the Chesapeake Flotilla at Pig Point in Prince George's County and Anne Arundel County, MD; the American defeat at the Battle of Bladensburg; the siege of the Nation's Capital and the burning of the U.S. Capitol and the White House in Washington, DC; the route of the American troops from Washington through Georgetown, the Maryland  counties of Montgomery, Howard, and Baltimore, and the city of Baltimore to the Battle of North Point; and the ultimate victory of the Americans at Fort McHenry on September 14, 1814.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Park Service will administer the trail and coordinate the efforts of public and private entities on trail administration, planning, development, and maintenance. Fort McHenry will be the lead park unit for trail operations. The land routes would follow existing public roads, along which British and American troops traveled. Over time, the routes will be marked on the ground and at water access points. In cases where the original routes have been lost to development or other causes,  they could be interpreted through waysides as appropriate and feasible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill requires the Secretary to encourage public participation and consult with landowners, Federal, State, and local governments on the administration of the trail. The bill prohibits land or interest in land outside the exterior boundaries of any federally administered area from being acquired for the trail without the consent of the owner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The trail will open new economic opportunities for many Maryland communities, including Calvert County, our Port Towns of Prince George's County, and Baltimore City. More importantly, the Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail will guide Americans on a path that will help them understand the events that lead up to the epic battle at Fort McHenry in Baltimore Harbor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the fort, the garrison flag was flown on September 13 and 14, 1814, during the Battle of Baltimore. As the routed British ships sailed out of Baltimore Harbor on the morning of the 14th, lawyer Francis Scott Key was inspired to write the patriotic and defiant words of a poem that became the rallying cry for Americans who had fought their first war as a united nation. The poem was set to music and the song became the national anthem in 1931.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The "Star-Spangled Banner" was given to the Smithsonian Institution in 1907 by the grandson of the commander of Fort McHenry, LTC George Armistead, so that it could be preserved and displayed for the public. While the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History is currently closed for extensive renovation, its reopening this summer will showcase the Banner in an impressive new exhibit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, every day across the country, Americans salute the American flag. The Senate recites the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag every legislative day. In sports arenas and countless other venues, we salute the flag daily. Today, I salute the work of the Senate in passing the Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail as part of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008. Through this legislation, millions of visitors will be inspired with the history of this iconic object and its  significance during this important period of American history.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300077" topic="NOT VOTING--5">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to speak on an item included in the bill before us. Before I address this particular issue, I first want to voice my strong support for some of the individual components that have been assembled in the consolidated package currently before the body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail extension and the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program and Pathfinder Modification Project authorization are measures I have been working on for some time, and I want to thank Chairman Bingaman for his efforts in bringing these measures to the point where they will shortly pass the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there is another matter in this bill that is of some importance to Nebraska and to my constituents. Included in the bill is a section expressing the sense of Congress that a museum located in Paducah, KY should be designated as "the National Quilt Museum of the United States." Now, this measure is nonbinding and carries no legal authority. As far as we can tell, it confers no authority for funding or anything of that nature. However, I would be remiss if I failed to mention that I had been  working to resolve some concerns that I and some of my constituents have with this section.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You see, just the week before last, the International Quilt Study Center &amp; Museum opened its doors in Lincoln, NE. This is a remarkable, 37,000 square foot facility that houses the world's largest privately held collection of quilts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus, back in February, I objected to a unanimous consent request to pass <bill type="hc" number="209">H. Con. Res. 209</bill>, a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of Congress regarding the designation of the museum. That resolution had previously passed the House of Representatives unanimously. I have been working with the distinguished minority leader, Mr. McConnell, and Congressman Whitfield of Kentucky, whose district includes Paducah, to craft a solution that would appropriately praise both museums  for their individual and unique contributions to the world of quilts and quilt-making. I would like to thank them for their willingness to work with me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the entirety of <bill type="hc" number="209">H. Con. Res. 209</bill> was included in section 335 of this bill before these discussions were able to run their course. I have filed an amendment to strike this section from the bill, so that we might continue to work out a resolution that properly honors the Paducah museum while not making any exclusive designations that exclude the International Quilt Study Center, but I understand the situation is such that my amendment is prevented from consideration before the full  Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Looking forward, I plan to honor this remarkable organization at the University of Nebraska in an appropriate manner. For purposes of balancing the record here today, I want to mention a few things about the remarkable facility in Nebraska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The International Quilt Study Center &amp; Museum has 37,000 square feet of exhibition galleries, collections storage, collections care, a reception hall, a library, reading room and classroom  space. It is housed in a beautiful, newly constructed building designed by world-renowned architecture firm Robert A.M. Stern Architects and built with $12 million in private donations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mission of the International Quilt Study Center &amp; Museum is to collect, preserve, study, exhibit, and promote discovery of quilts and quilt-making traditions from many cultures, countries, and time periods. The International Quilt Study Center &amp; Museum is a dynamic center of formal and informal learning and discovery for students, teachers, scholars, artists, quilters, and others from across the Nation and around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The International Quilt Study Center &amp; Museum has the largest privately held quilt collection in the world--more than 2,300 quilts from 49 States and 23 foreign countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The International Quilt Study Center &amp; Museum is centrally located in the heart of the United States and is open to the public year-round. I wish I could share information on the number of visitors who enjoy the museum each year, but the new facility is so new that such data is unavailable. However, we do know that individuals from all 50 States and from more than 15 foreign countries have visited the International Quilt Study Center &amp; Museum in its previous homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The International Quilt Study Center &amp; Museum has an international advisory board and annual supporters from all 50 States and many foreign countries, and hundreds of supporters, volunteers, and quilt guilds have supported the International Quilt Study Center annually since its formation in 1997.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The International Quilt Study Center's collections represent the entire gamut of quilt making in the United States, plus its antecedents in Europe. In addition, the International Quilt Study Center holds examples of cultural traditions from more than 23 countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, the International Quilt Study Center &amp; Museum in Nebraska is recognized nationally and internationally for its place of prominence in its field. It has the largest publicly held collection of quilts in the world; it is the largest quilt museum in the world; it is the only academic center devoted to quilt studies; it offers the only graduate program in textile history with a quilt studies emphasis. At the appropriate time, I hope the Congress will see fit to bestow upon it an honor  befitting its contributions to our Nation's art, our heritage, and our history.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, as the Senate considers the Consolidated Natural Resources Act, I would like to highlight two provisions that are important for Illinois: the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area and the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail Extension.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Illinois is known as the Land of Lincoln for good reason. Our 16th President spent more than 30 years of his life in central Illinois, starting in 1830 when his family moved to Macon County from Indiana. Abraham Lincoln had virtually no formal education--perhaps 18 months of schooling. His rise from humble origins to the highest office in the land and his decisive leadership through the most harrowing period of U.S. history brings hope and inspiration to all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next year marks the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth. Among the public activities planned to honor his life is development of the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area. Communities in 42 Illinois counties have worked together to document Lincoln's time in the State, assess the status of the places that played a role in his life and career, and recommend a plan to help develop the narrative of Lincoln's imprint on Illinois. The goal is to help develop sites in places where there is a Lincoln story  to tell but no place to tell that story. Although the heritage area focuses on the life of Abraham Lincoln, the heritage area also brings out the rich history of each participating community, creating a broader context for Lincoln and his times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Illinois features prominently in another important, earlier story in the making of America--the historic expedition of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark across the western frontier. Much has been said and written about that western journey, but equally fascinating is the "Eastern Legacy" of the Lewis and Clark expedition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The journey began right here in the District of Columbia. That is where President Thomas Jefferson directed his private secretary Meriwether Lewis in June 1803 to lead a mission through the vast unknown territory west of the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean. Lewis gathered supplies and men in many Eastern States before meeting up with William Clark in Kentucky and traveling to Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lewis and Clark established their winter camp at the mouth of the Wood River in Illinois. The following spring their Corps of Discovery departed Camp Dubois and began their historic scientific expedition west. Lewis marked this spot near present-day Wood River, IL, as the official "point of departure." Two and a half years later, the team returned to this camp after its remarkable adventure to the Pacific coast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill the Senate is considering will preserve this important and fascinating story through the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail Extension, which will include sites associated with the preparation and return phases of the expedition--the Eastern Legacy. The trail extension includes sites in 11 Eastern States and the District of Columbia. The trail in Illinois includes sites from Metropolis along the Ohio River to Wood River at the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These two initiatives are very important to Illinois. I know the bill includes similar initiatives in other States. These development areas are significant, not just for the historic and cultural legacy but also for the economic development value for the host communities. Many Illinois communities participating in these heritage areas are very rural--with populations less than 3,000, few resources, and high unemployment rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill does much to preserve areas of natural beauty and expand our national historic trail system and national heritage areas that bring families outdoors and across our Nation to discover important events and geographic locations in the creation of America. It also celebrates Native American, Colonial American, European American, Latino American, and African American heritage. Finally, the bill establishes memorials and museums to honor our past and authorizes studies as the first step toward  preserving historic sites that are at risk of being forgotten</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Illinoisans are proud of our heritage and our place in history. The preservation programs in the Consolidated Natural Resources Act help tell America's stories--stories of sacrifice, bravery, and awe of the land's natural beauty--so that we and our children can carry on the historical traditions that others have handed down to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Consolidated Natural Resources Act is a bipartisan package that brings together nearly four dozen projects to preserve our Nation's land and our Nation's heritage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, today I join my colleagues in supporting the passage of <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>, the omnibus lands bill, which included two issues of special interest to me. First, the bill seeks to correct profound problems in local immigration laws that have enabled the import of low paid, short termed indentured workers to be brought to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, CNMI. Some were bought to work in garment factories. Others arrived in the CNMI, only to find that there was  no job waiting for them, and were forced to find unpalatable means to work off their bondage debt. I am pleased that today, this bill will address longstanding concerns regarding the CNMI's immigration problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, this bill also includes a provision to expand the boundary of the Minidoka Internment National Monument, and establish a unit on Bainbridge Island, Washington, for a new Japanese American Memorial at the Eagledale Ferry Dock. The Minidoka site is significant, because the Minidoka Internment Camp featured the highest level of military participation in any of the camps, and Bainbridge Island was the first community for Japanese Americans to be relocated to. I believe that we need to do  all that we can to preserve internment camp sites, because they serve as a powerful reminder of how important it is to have a vibrant democracy that protects the civil liberties of all.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="NOT VOTING--5">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today in support of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act, <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>. This omnibus package includes language that is especially important to my State, as well as the Nation. Amongst other things, <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> would designate some of America's most historic and beautiful lands as National Heritage Areas, including the area along Route 15 in Virginia. Known as the Journey Through Hallowed Ground, this effort has been championed by myself, my good friend Congressman</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues are aware, National Heritage Areas are intended to encourage residents, government agencies, nonprofit groups, and private partners to collaboratively plan and implement programs and projects to recognize, preserve, and celebrate many of America's defining landscapes. Today, there are 37 National Heritage Areas spread out across the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Virginia, we are lucky enough to have a landscape that is worthy of the recognition and celebration that a National Heritage Area designation would afford it. Stretching through four States, and generally following the path of the Old Carolina Road, today's Route 15, the proposed Journey Through Hallowed Ground National Heritage Area is home to some of our Nation's greatest historic, cultural, and natural treasures. The region's riches read like a star-studded list of American History: Monticello,  Montpelier, Manassas, Gettysburg. The list goes on. In all, there are 15 National Historic Landmarks, 47 historic districts, a number of Presidential homes, and the largest collection of Civil War battlefields in the Country. It is an area, literally, where America happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With basic, technical assistance from the National Park Service, this proposed Heritage area would be managed by The Journey Through Hallowed Ground Partnership, a nonprofit entity whose sole purpose is to trumpet the magnificence of the Hallowed Ground's offerings. Already, the Partnership has provided opportunities for thousands of visitors to enjoy the region's spectacular natural and historical resources, and they have worked hard to get this area the designation and recognition it deserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, before I conclude, I would like to take a quick moment to address several of the arguments voiced by critics against national heritage areas. First and foremost among these arguments, is that national heritage areas infringe upon private property rights. This simply is not accurate. As the Government Accountability Office, GAO, noted in testimony to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, "National heritage areas do not appear [to affect] private property rights", GAO-04-593T. Furthermore,  as an example that they don't, I offer up the State of Tennessee, in its entirety, which today is designated a national heritage area and has had no intrusion on property rights. And, lastly, I point to language in this legislation that I specifically put in to ensure that no intrusion on property rights occured. It states, in some detail, that "nothing in this subtitle abridges the rights of any property owner."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other criticisms include concerns about the costs of heritage areas, and also that heritage areas increase the role of the Federal Government. To the issue of costs, I note that heritage areas provide a way for the Federal Government to highlight our Nation's historical, cultural, and natural resources without having to actually own and maintain them--which, as we know by the current maintenance backlogs in the Park System, are quite costly to the American taxpayer. Secondly, I would like to  remind my friends that often heritage areas require a funding match before a single Federal dollar can be appropriated. This is the case for the heritage area which I come to champion today--The Journey Through Hallowed Ground. Every taxpayer dollar that is appropriated to the Journey Through Hallowed Ground must be matched equally by non-Federal entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As for the other criticism, that heritage areas increase the role of the Federal Government and impose upon State and local governments, I note that heritage areas require and provide exorbitant opportunity for State and local input. In fact, in forming the Hallowed Ground, the local coordinating entity sought and received support from every local city, county, and town within the proposed Heritage Area. The Governor and Virginia General Assembly, whom I sincerely thank, also supported this effort.  I commend the Journey Through Hallowed Ground Partnership for reaching out to all these groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, and I thank you for this opportunity to speak on behalf of The Journey Through Hallowed Ground.</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="DOOD" of="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I support of <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>, the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, sponsored by Senator Bingaman, the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. This legislation will protect and preserve natural treasures all across this country. It is of particular importance to me and to the people of Connecticut, as it contains a provision I authored that would ensure the preservation of the Eightmile River watershed under the auspices of the Wild and Scenic  Rivers Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As elected representatives, I believe that one of our most important obligations is to ensure that this country's vast array of natural resources and wilderness is managed in an environmentally responsible and sustainable way. We owe it to future generations of Americans to protect the areas of pristine beauty and ecological diversity that figure so prominently in our Nation's history and character. Since 1968, the National Wild and Scenic River Act has played a critical role in furthering this  mission by making it the policy of the United States to preserve in free-flowing fashion, rivers of, to quote the act, "scenic, recreational, geologic, fish and wildlife, historic,  cultural or other similar values . . . for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Designation of the Eightmile River as a Wild and Scenic River enjoys extraordinarily broad support in my home State, and a 3-year study by the National Park Service found that the river meets the criteria to receive a "scenic" designation. The entire Connecticut Congressional delegation supports this legislation, as does the Connecticut State Legislature, which passed a resolution of support. Most importantly, designation is supported by the communities that will be most affected by this designation,  those in the Eightmile watershed. This effort to preserve the special attributes of the Eightmile is a product of the communities' recognition of the beauty and fragility of the special place in which they live. Votes in each community were strongly in favor of designation, in part because the study process and debate allowed for many perspectives to be heard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The attributes of the river that are so valued by the residents of Connecticut include its clean water, with 92 percent of the watershed's streamwater meeting the State's highest quality standards, and no point sources of pollution. The streams flow freely with no dams or diversions--rare in a State that has been densely populated as long as Connecticut. Eighty percent of the land area is forested. The natural streams and large areas of interconnected forest provide habitat for rare species.  In fact, the study for eligibility determined that the Eightmile River watershed ranks in the 99th percentile in New England for globally rare species per unit area. The residents of this unique area treasure the beautiful character of the Eightmile watershed. It is a quintessential rural New England landscape, dotted with colonial homes and historic churches and unmarred by modern industrial development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The towns within the watershed have begun to implement the parts of the watershed management plan that are in their jurisdiction. Congressional designation as a Wild and Scenic River will bolster these efforts and provide the stability for ongoing long-term preservation. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation, and I thank the chairman of the Energy Committee for his extraordinary commitment to protecting this country's natural treasures.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>, a package of natural resource bills that Chairman Bingaman has assembled. The bills that are in this package have received the unanimous endorsement of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and have cleared the House. I want to thank Senator Bingaman for his leadership in the Committee and I want to thank Majority Leader Reid for bringing this package before the Senate for consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are four bills in this package that I am particularly proud to support: <bill type="s" number="500">S. 500</bill>, a bill that would form a commission to study the possible creation of the National Museum of the American Latino; <bill type="s" number="1116">S. 1116</bill>, a bill that would help make better use of the water that is produced as a byproduct of energy development; <bill type="s" number="752">S. 752</bill>, a bill that would authorize a program to assist with endangered species recovery along the Platte River in Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming; and <bill type="s" number="327">S. 327</bill>, the C&#xE9;sar Estrada  Ch&#xE1;vez Study Act, which would help preserve the legacy of one of our Nation's most important civil rights leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to spend a couple minutes talking about each of these bills, but first, Mr. President, I want to discuss the process through which we are debating these bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is, as my colleagues all know, a highly unusual process for debating natural resource bills. Typically, the Senate is able to take up and pass with the strong support the 100 Members in this Chamber--most bills that pertain to national parks, forests, national museums, historic preservation, and cultural resource protections. If a bill clears the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee by unanimous consent it is likely that the full Senate will clear it by unanimous consent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why has this been the practice? Because most of the bills we pass out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee are bipartisan, noncontroversial, and easily garner the unanimous support of 100 Members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is how Congress established the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park in Colorado in 1999. It is how we passed the Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve Act in my native San Luis Valley in 2000. It is how we established the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site in Kiowa County in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is how we pass bills like the Buffalo Soldiers Commemoration Act, the Eisenhower Memorial Act, and the Ojito Wilderness Act. The list goes on and on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on issues like health care, the economy, and Iraq, the parties do have real and substantial differences, and those differences merit serious debate here on the floor. But on how to protect our national treasures and traditions, we are usually in lock step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, that has not been the case this year. Instead, every single bill that leaves the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, regardless of its subject or content, has encountered an objection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, each of us is certainly within our rights in objecting to a bill. That is a solemn right in this chamber, and it is one that ensures that when a Member has a strong, substantive objection to a bill, he or she can be heard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, Mr. President, I fear that the objections to these bills make it even more difficult to make progress on the issues that face our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All the bills in this package have my support and the support of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, but there are four bills of which I am particularly proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first, <bill type="s" number="500">S. 500</bill>, would help us determine how we can more properly recognize the contributions of Hispanic Americans to our nation's history. The Commission to Study the Potential Creation of the National Museum of the American Latino Act of 2007 would do what its title suggests: it would establish a commission to study the potential creation of a national museum dedicated to the art, culture, and history of Hispanic Americans. The Commission will be tasked with studying the impact of the potential  museum and the cost of construction and maintenance. It will also be tasked with developing an action plan, a fundraising plan, and a recommendation on whether to proceed with construction of the museum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second, <bill type="s" number="1116">S. 1116</bill>, is a bill I worked on with my colleague from Colorado, Representative MARK UDALL, which would help make better use of the water that is produced during energy development. Each day, more than two million gallons of useable groundwater are wasted, turned into what is known as "produced water," after it is brought to the surface during oil and gas drilling or coal bed methane extraction. This water is often contaminated beyond use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The "More Water, More Energy, Less Waste Act of 2007", cosponsored by Senators BINGAMAN, DOMENICI, and ENZI--along with the late Senator Thomas--initiates a feasibility study on recovering "produced water." It also establishes a grant program to test technologies that would convert "produced" water to "useable" water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will be of great value in the arid West, where we are constantly looking for ways to increase our water supplies for crop irrigation, livestock watering, wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities. It is deserving of swift passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third bill I would like to highlight is <bill type="s" number="752">S. 752</bill>, the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program and Pathfinder Modification Authorization Act of 2007. It is a bill that Senator Ben Nelson, Senator Allard, Senator Hagel and I introduced. The bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to participate in a program to help endangered species recovery along the Platte River in Nebraska, Colorado, and Wyoming. The Governors of Nebraska, Colorado, and Wyoming and the  Department of Interior spent nine years developing the plan for this program, which they finalized in 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="752">S. 752</bill> authorizes the Secretary of Interior to carry out the Endangered Species Recovery Program in partnership with the States. Under the bill, the States and Federal Government will share costs, 50-50, on projects that provide benefits for endangered and threatened species recovery and that  help with the monitoring and research on the benefits of the program. The bill authorizes $157 million to support the federal portion of the work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. President, this package includes a bill, <bill type="s" number="327">S. 327</bill>, that would help preserve the legacy of one of our Nation's top civil rights leaders, C&#xE9;sar Estrada Ch&#xE1;vez.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know the story of C&#xE9;sar Ch&#xE1;vez. From a family of migrant farm workers, C&#xE9;sar Ch&#xE1;vez began working in the fields at age 10. He moved from job to job across the Southwest, enduring the hardships and injustices of farm worker life. In 1952, at age 35, Ch&#xE1;vez started working as a community activist, fighting for civil rights for all workers. Ten years later, he founded the National Farm Workers Association, which became the United Farm Workers of America, and led efforts  to improve wages and working conditions. Ch&#xE1;vez, through his work to improve the lives of farm workers across the country, is one of our nation's most important civil rights leaders. We must honor his memory and remember the sacrifices he made on our behalf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To that end, the C&#xE9;sar Estrada Ch&#xE1;vez Study Act would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a resource study, not later than 3 years after funds are made available, of sites associated with the life of C&#xE9;sar Estrada Ch&#xE1;vez. The study would help determine whether those sites meet the criteria for being listed on the National Register of Historic Places or possible designation as national historic landmarks. I am a proud co-sponsor of this bill and will continue  to fight until it is passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to again thank Chairman Bingaman and Majority Leader Reid for their leadership in bringing this package of lands bills to the floor and for working to overcome the obstructionism that has, unfortunately, become so common in this body. These are bipartisan, common-sense bills that will help protect our nation's natural, cultural, and historic heritage, and I urge their prompt passage.</paragraph>

  <narrative>SEC. 331. COMMEMORATIVE WORK TO HONOR BRIGADIER GENERAL FRANCIS MARION AND HIS FAMILY.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Francis Marion was born in 1732 in St. John's Parish, Berkeley County, South Carolina. He married Mary Esther Videau on April 20th, 1786. Francis and Mary Esther Marion had no children, but raised a son of a relative as their own, and gave the child Francis Marion's name.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Brigadier General Marion commanded the Williamsburg Militia Revolutionary force in South Carolina and was instrumental in delaying the advance of British forces by leading his troops in disrupting supply lines.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Brigadier General Marion's tactics, which were unheard of in rules of warfare at the time, included lightning raids on British convoys, after which he and his forces would retreat into the swamps to avoid capture. British Lieutenant Colonel Tarleton stated that "as for this damned old swamp fox, the devil himself could not catch him". Thus, the legend of the "Swamp Fox" was born.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) His victory at the Battle of Eutaw Springs in September of 1781 was officially recognized by Congress.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) Brigadier General Marion's troops are believed to be the first racially integrated force fighting for the United States, as his band was a mix of Whites, Blacks, both free and slave, and Native Americans.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) As a statesman, he represented his parish in the South Carolina senate as well as his State at the Constitutional Convention.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) Although the Congress has authorized the establishment of commemorative works on Federal lands in the District of Columbia honoring such celebrated Americans as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln, the National Capital has no comparable memorial to Brigadier General Francis Marion for his bravery and leadership during the Revolutionary War, without which the United States would not exist.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) Brigadier General Marion's legacy must live on. Since 1878, United States Reservation 18 has been officially referred to as Marion Park. Located between 4th and 6th Streets, S.E., at the intersection of E Street and South Carolina Avenue, S.E., in Washington, DC, the park lacks a formal commemoration to this South Carolina hero who was important to the initiation of the Nation's heritage.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) The time has come to correct this oversight so that future generations of Americans will know and understand the preeminent historical and lasting significance to the Nation of Brigadier General Marion's contributions. Such a South Carolina hero deserves to be given the proper recognition.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Authority To Establish Commemorative Work.--The Marion Park Project, a committee of the Palmetto Conservation Foundation, may establish a commemorative work on Federal land in the District of Columbia and its environs to honor Brigadier General Francis Marion and his service.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (c) Compliance With Standards for Commemorative Works.--The commemorative work authorized by subsection (b) shall be established in accordance with chapter 89 of title 40, United States Code (commonly known as the "Commemorative Works Act").&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (d) Use of Federal Funds Prohibited.--Federal funds may not be used to pay any expense of the establishment of the commemorative work authorized by subsection (b). The Marion Park Project, a committee of the Palmetto Conservation Foundation, shall be solely responsible for acceptance of contributions for, and payment of the expenses of, the establishment of that commemorative work.</narrative>
  <narrative> (e) Deposit of Excess Funds.--If, upon payment of all expenses of the establishment of the commemorative work authorized by subsection (b) (including the maintenance and preservation amount provided for in section 8906(b) of title 40, United States Code), or upon expiration of the authority for the commemorative work under chapter 89 of title 40, United States Code, there remains a balance of funds received for the establishment of that commemorative work, the Marion Park Project, a  committee of the Palmetto Conservation Foundation, shall transmit the amount of the balance to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit in the account provided for in section 8906(b)(1) of such title.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (f) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section, the terms "commemorative work" and "the District of Columbia and its environs" have the meanings given to such terms in section 8902(a) of title 40, United States Code.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 332.

They worked long and hard to put this legislation together and get it into a form where it could be considered by the Senate.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300076" topic="TITLE VIII--COMPACTS OF FREE ASSOCIATION AMENDMENTS">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico for his tremendous work. I rise to thank all of my colleagues for supporting the public lands and natural resources package that was just passed by the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, like many of my colleagues, have a vested interest in this bill. It contains my Wild Sky Wilderness Act which will designate over 100,000 acres as wilderness. This proposal is the result of almost 9 years of work by myself and Congressman Larsen of my home State. It has the support of the vast majority of the communities around the area, as well as outdoor enthusiasts, area businesses, and literally thousands of Washington State residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Larsen and I began working on Wild Sky back in 1999 because we were troubled by the rapid growth in Seattle and surrounding areas. We are so fortunate in our State to have unique and beautiful natural landscapes from the peaks of the Cascade Mountains, the northwest rain forest, the Olympic Peninsula to the mighty Columbia River. But many of our special lands could be jeopardized if we do not take action to preserve them now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Wild Sky Wilderness area will ensure that 106,000 acres of rolling hills, rushing rivers, and low-elevation forest in Washington State's Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest are going to be preserved for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am immensely proud of this legislation. The Wild Sky Wilderness area is just 90 minutes away from downtown Seattle. It will give more than 2.4 million from Snohomish, King, and Skagit Counties easy access to hike and camp in a distinctive northwest landscape, it will preserve unique low elevation ecosystems, and it is going to give the surrounding towns a great economic boost by increasing the number of visitors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am especially proud because so many people in Washington State are so excited about this wilderness proposal. Newspapers have endorsed it in more than 50 editorials, and more than 200 newspaper articles, op-eds, and letters to the editor have raved about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the fourth time the Senate has considered this bill. Wild Sky in the past has passed the Senate unanimously three times because we saw the value of this wilderness proposal and recognized that this bill is something my State supports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, for the first time, Wild Sky passed the House, and now passing the Senate, we are so close to making this truly a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that in mind, I want to take a few minutes to share with my colleagues what they just did. I want them to see some of the benefits this bill offers my home State of Washington and why people in my State are so eager to create the Wild Sky Wilderness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the days when Native people and early settlers harvested salmon and timber from our streams and forests, people who live in Washington State have recognized the importance of our natural heritage. We have a great tradition in my State of respecting and enjoying the natural beauty that surrounds us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington State is home to tremendously natural resources, and we have a proud history of embracing our national parks and our forests. The Wild Sky area is already being enjoyed by many of our citizens who hike or hunt or raft or camp there. And since we proposed designating it as wilderness, literally thousands of people have written Congressman Larsen and me to share their support. Many of those writers told personal stories about their experiences in the Wild Sky area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mike Town is a high school science teacher from Duvall, WA. He described introducing his students to a wild salmon spawning site near the Wild Sky Wilderness. Because that river's headwaters are in the proposed wilderness area, the water is still so pristine there that salmon are able to thrive, and today it is the one of the few places left in the Cascades where spawning salmon are still so numerous you could actually walk across the river on their backs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mike called that river one of the greatest spectacles in nature, and he said to me:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cherish the belief that with federal protection for this area, my teenage students will have the ability to share the experience of spawning wild salmon with their grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the first reason we are so excited about Wild Sky is because it reflects the values of the people of Washington State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But another reason this bill has so much support is because we worked hard to accommodate the needs of the users of this area. Very early on in the process, we reached out to all the local stakeholders to gauge their interest and ask if they had any concerns, and we were able to work with them and address many of the issues they raised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We worked with Longview Fibre, a paper company that had some land in the proposed boundary. As a result, we were able to draw out certain areas and prioritize others that the company was willing to sell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We heard from local and State snowmobile groups concerned that the boundaries of our original proposal would shut out important riding areas. So we took out a vast majority of those areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We ensured that float planes still have access to Lake Isabel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We worked with the Forest Service and excluded heavily used areas around Barclay Lake and the only two areas where timber sales were being considered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We made sure that Snohomish County and the Forest Service were comfortable with the emergency communication capability in and around the wilderness area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And last winter, massive floods altered the path of the Skykomish River and displaced and destroyed parts of that road that provides access through our proposed wilderness area. So Congressman Larsen and I got back together and brought together Snohomish County, the Forest Service, and local advocates to responsibly adjust the boundaries of this wilderness to make sure the road could be rebuilt and remain open for future use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to all of this work, we have the support now of many of the locally elected officials and most of the surrounding towns and counties. Local conservation, hunting, and fishing groups back this bill. The Seaplane Pilots Association and many local businesses endorse it, and the Under Secretary of Natural Resources for the Forest Service, Mark Rey, said the President will sign this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though many people in Washington State understand and appreciate the value of wilderness, this bill has a lot of support because we were also willing to work with the diverse groups of people who have an interest in how this land is used. This truly was a public process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although we, of course, could not meet every single need, we have made every effort to accommodate everyone who engaged in this process, and thanks to this effort, this bill is an example of wilderness done the right way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to talk about the benefits of Wild Sky because I am so excited about what it offers people who live in my State and those who visit. Several years ago, I took a trip through the area where the Wild Sky Wilderness would be. It is very hard to put into words how beautiful this stunning, amazing area is that is 90 minutes from downtown Seattle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A significant part of this wilderness is seemingly endless expanses of meadows. Rolling mountains can be seen that are covered with stands of huge old moss-covered trees, and some of those trees are over 100 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the ridges, you have incredible views of the western slopes of the Cascade Mountains.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This area is so unique. And one of the things that makes it unique is its relatively low elevation. About one-third of Wild Sky is below 3,000 feet. So the Wild Sky Wilderness area is going to bring new ecological systems into our wilderness lands that are underrepresented right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wild Sky links our forests and meadows and steep craggy peaks, as you can see, and it is going to create a protected habitat corridor for all the wildlife living in this area. We have wolves and mountain goats, black and grizzly bears, and deer and trout.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Salmon spawning grounds teeming with fish--just like the one my town's science teacher showed his students--used to be very common, but today many of those species are struggling to survive. So at a time when we are asking private landowners to assist in recovering wild fish runs, I believe the Federal Government ought to do everything it can on its own land to help protect and restore that wildlife habitat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, Madam President, the Wild Sky Wilderness is going to offer us great new recreational opportunities for people in a growing region. Wild Sky is unusually accessible because of its low elevation, and it is near an urban area. So families looking for a quick and easy access to nature are going to be able to enjoy this very pristine land. Climbers and hikers, hunters and anglers have already sent us letters and e-mails talking about the opportunities that Wild Sky offers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mark Heckert, who is a fish and wildlife biologist from Puyallup, wrote to me that he has taken his two sons to camp and hunt and fish in this area. He wrote me about how much he values the outdoors and said he hopes to secure the Wild Sky Wilderness for his children to enjoy. He said to me:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wild landscapes like those provided in the Wild Sky provide the stage for a generational right of passage where young boys and girls can discover their connection to our land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Creating this Wild Sky Wilderness is going to ensure that Mark and his sons can return to Wild Sky in the years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Madam President, hikers, climbers, rafters, hunters, and anglers who visit us in the Puget Sound area--and I invite everyone who is listening to come and enjoy Wild Sky--will spend their money as they travel through this area. Recreational enthusiasts will see Wild Sky in the future listed on maps and guide books as a special destination, and those tourists will come and stay in our hotels and our campgrounds and eat in our restaurants and use local guides and outfitters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, the outdoor recreation business appears to have stayed healthy, even during bad economic times, and Wild Sky is going to help contribute to that in the future. And, again, I invite all who are listening to come and enjoy this beautiful place that you saw get voted on here in the Senate this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, those are just a few of the benefits of this Wild Sky Wilderness. We have done a lot of hard work on this bill in the last 8 years, and we couldn't have done it without the help of a lot of people. So let me take the last few minutes and thank all of the people across my State and here in the Senate who have worked so hard to get this bill done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Chairman Bingaman and his great staff, especially Bob Simon and David Brooks, for their help and their unwavering support of Wild Sky throughout all the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senator Domenici, who is leaving us this year to retire. Without him and his hard work on this bill, we wouldn't be here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senators CRAPO and MURKOWSKI for all they did over the past weeks and months to move this package forward. I couldn't have gotten here--we couldn't have gotten here--without their hard work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank many of my staff members, especially Doug Clapp, who helped me originally develop this bill many years ago; Jaime Shimek, Evan Schatz, and Mike Spahn. I can't even begin to say all the names of my staff members who over the years have worked with us as we have developed this bill and gotten it over the finish line. I thank all of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize the hard work and support of Congressman Larsen and his staff, Senator Cantwell and her staff. She is on the Senate floor this afternoon as well and serves on the committee. I could not have done it without her help and support. I know she has climbed into the Wild Sky and seen it as well as I have and is as excited as I am to be out there to see this completed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Under Secretary Mark Rey of the administration, who supported this bill for many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But above all, Madam President, I thank the people of my home State of Washington who have worked tirelessly to bring this idea from a proposal on a  piece of paper 9 years ago to legislation that was passed in the Senate this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to be back when the President signs this bill into law and thank a broader list of people who have been so essential, but as I finish this afternoon I want to note the work of Tom Uniack and Mike Town, and I thank them personally for all their work. They have been so willing to listen and to answer questions and to give tours of the Wild Sky country and have worked with us every step of the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom and Mike, thank you. All your hard work has paid off, and we now have passed in the Senate a very popular bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wild Sky is going to help my State take a great step forward in protecting our environment. It is going to enhance our economy, it is going to improve our recreational opportunities, and I can tell you, people from my State are eager to get this bill through the House quickly and on to the President's desk to be signed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We took a major step forward toward this goal today, and, again, I invite all of you who are listening to come to the State of Washington and visit Wild Sky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Washington is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300018" topic="TITLE VIII--COMPACTS OF FREE ASSOCIATION AMENDMENTS">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise to speak a few minutes about the public lands bill we just voted out of the Senate with a pretty resounding majority of Members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Within that public lands bill we just voted on is the only wilderness designation, the one my colleague from Washington just described--the Wild Sky Wilderness area. And I am here to not only congratulate her on this important legislation but to also speak because so much was said prior to the vote about why we would have such legislation on the Senate floor, and about the issue of Federal lands in individual States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think my colleague from Washington just articulated exactly why such an important piece of legislation is needed, the fact that it is the designation of a wilderness area that she has been trying to get ever since I have been in the Senate. In fact, she mentioned 9 years she has been working on that legislation. Since at least 2001, I have seen this legislation in various forms move through either the House or the Senate. I am sure her enthusiasm today is about the prospect of the Senate and  the House, under Democratic control, actually getting this legislation passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let me make a couple of points because my colleague, Senator Murray, brought up this issue, the specifics of Wild Sky's designation. It is a beautiful place. I have had the opportunity to hike there and to see the beauty firsthand. But people don't understand the designation of these Federal lands. I will say right now that I know how much Federal land is in Washington State. We have 12.2 million acres out of over 42 million acres. That is 29 percent of our State. I understand other  States may not like that kind of designation, but for us in Washington State it has been part of our lifestyle and part of what we want to preserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, Mount Rainier, one of our most visited special places, over 1 million people visit it on an annual basis. And a little company some people may have heard of, REI, based in Seattle, has outdoor recreational gear and does about $1 million worth of business annually. So there are people who very much believe in the outdoors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure the Presiding Officer knows very well that the beauty of special places is worth preserving, and it is a great boon to our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Murray did an unbelievable job in shepherding this legislation through the Senate and working with her colleague in the House, Congressman Larsen, now for 7 years. There were many times in which she could have gotten detoured by various Members. Actually, this has passed three times in the Senate on the consent calendar but has been either delayed in the House or a Member held it up, and really held up an opportunity for many people to enjoy what our State has, in a  very bipartisan way, been supporting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Washington State, many people are conservationists. Before they are Republicans or Democrats or Independents, they are conservationists first. Senator Murray has had to persevere with this legislation through various individual Members holding it up. So I say a special thanks to her. And I know if Scoop Jackson were alive, Scoop Jackson would be here to also congratulate her, as someone who did the original wilderness designation. She would be very honored to know that someone such  as Scoop, in writing this original legislation, had the issues of Wild Sky very much in mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, how much time do I have?</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300018" topic="TITLE VIII--COMPACTS OF FREE ASSOCIATION AMENDMENTS">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I want to also mention another piece of the underlying legislation because, again, some people have questioned, why do a public lands bill of this nature. Another piece of this legislation that I have worked on with my colleague, Congressman Inslee of Bainbridge Island in our State, is to preserve an area known as the Eagledale Ferry Dock site on Bainbridge Island as a unit of the national monument designation under our national park system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People may say, well, why designate this particular area? During World War II, over 120,000 Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps, and the first place from which they were forced to leave and to go to the internment camps was from this site on Bainbridge Island in Washington State. On March 30, 1942, 227 residents of Bainbridge Island were asked to report to this ferry dock site and were taken to internment camps in Minidoka, ID, and Tule Lake in northern California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is what this lands bill is about. It is about protecting wilderness and making designations of sites that should be remembered. So I am very proud we got this bill off the floor, and I hope we will see immediate action by the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
