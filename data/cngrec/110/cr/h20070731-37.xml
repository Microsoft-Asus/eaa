    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we are all anticipating the report David Petraeus will bring us in mid-September. But between now and then, there is hard work, dangerous work, and important work that has to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For Members on the other side of the aisle to begin to anticipate what David may say to us and to plan political spinning of that is irresponsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, that is the "ready, fire, aim" approach to taking a position. That works well in a target-rich environment like the Alamo or Little Bighorn, but it is unworthy of Members of this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's don't anticipate what David might say. Let's don't undermine that work that is going on in Iraq. Let's take the responsible position and listen to what he has to say before we try to spin it.</paragraph>
