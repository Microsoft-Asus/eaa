  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last month I introduced <bill type="h" number="5982">H.R. 5982</bill>, the Biometric Enhancement for Airport Risk Reduction Act of 2008, also known as the BEAR Act. The bill was marked up and adopted unanimously by the House Committee on Homeland Security on May 20.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Transportation Security Administration is responsible for securing 450 U.S. airports and employs approximately 50,000 people. It has a very important mission of keeping the traveling public safe from terrorist threats. But the question remains, what is TSA doing to increase security and still allow workers with unescorted access to sterile and secure areas of airports? And what mechanisms are in place to ensure that only the employees are allowed to access the airports' secure and sterile  areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The BEAR Act addresses these concerns. It requires TSA to provide Congress and airport operators with a report on best practices for using biometrics at airports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last November, Federal law enforcement raided Chicago's O'Hare Airport and arrested 23 people for fraudulently securing badges that gave them unescorted access to sensitive airport locations. According to the charging affidavit, more than 100 temporary workers were found to be in possession of fraudulent badges. And the investigation revealed that the staffing agency that sponsored these workers told them that they needed identification, but it did not have to be legitimate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, workers with unescorted access to these critical facilities go through background screening to get identification badges. This background screening includes checking against a terrorist watch list. While this is a necessary and important check, a worker's biometrics are not being captured in check against biographic information to establish the individual's identity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the Chicago incident, there has been a growing international trend to incorporate biometric identifying credentials in airport IDs. Canada and the United Kingdom have already taken action to address the security risk at airports by using biometric identifying credentials for airport workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I recognize the ongoing work that TSA has been doing in the last year or so, it's time for them to consider moving forward. The BEAR Act will make this happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill promotes collaboration between TSA industry, labor, and other stakeholders to collectively develop and provide airports with a blueprint on how to make biometrics work for them. The BEAR Act, as amended, includes changes proposed by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and TSA to improve the bill, including clarifying that TSA should only conduct a risk-based study of Category 10 and Category 1 airports on a selected groups of airports, defining uniform biometric identified systems  to make sure that TSA looks at systems that actually match individuals, not just cards, that have biometrics on them, recognizing and not tampering with TSA's ongoing efforts in the area of biometrics such as the TWIC program and other programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="5982">H.R. 5982</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5982">H.R. 5982</bill>. As a Californian, the State that was once known as the Bear Republic, and proud resident of the State of California, which has the bear flag, I rise in support of the BEAR bill that the gentleman from Mississippi has introduced and brought to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The chairman from Mississippi has brought us a bill that seeks to build on work that has already been done in previous Congresses and also with TSA, but I think he gives us a little bit of a push to move in the direction of biometrics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Biometric Enhancement for Airport-Risk Reduction Act simply recognizes that as we go forward in trying to secure our airports and the flying public and the cargo from terrorist attack we need to use those things which give us an advantage over those who would do harm to us, and that means we need to have the smart use of technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from Mississippi has been one of those who has spoken for several years about the fact that we need to get biometrics on board more quickly than we have, and I join the gentleman in that hope. I think this bill will move us in that direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People should understand that biometrics merely refers to identifiers. They could be something as simple as fingerprints. They could be iris scans, things of that sort, some medium by which we are able to identify an individual with the documentation that they have. And then if you have readers that are all over the landscape now for various different enterprises, it allows you in an economical and in an efficient way to identify the individuals that are granted access to particular areas, and  this is particularly important when we're talking about vast areas that we find at airports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Airports are not severely confined by geography as are some other enterprises, some other commercial enterprises, where you might be able to more easily secure the area. Particularly when you have airports where you have individuals who are cleared to work there, moving in and out, in and out, in and out of areas which are supposed to be secured areas, you have to find a reasonably efficient means that is also an effective means of identifying those people who should be in those areas and those  people who should not be in those areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that is why biometric technology presents such an opportunity for us, and for these and other reasons I would support <bill type="h" number="5982">H.R. 5982</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished gentleman from Mississippi, the chairman of the committee, and I want to thank him and applaud him for this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As has been indicated on the floor, the importance of ensuring the security and the sanctity of the particular identification, the technology, is key. One of the key problems that we have found in homeland security is, of course, the ability to tamper with the security document or the process. This legislation is an important, enhanced effort to ensure that that does not happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the chairman for his leadership on this particular issue, and also, I think it's important to note that one of the commitments that homeland security has made is, "Not on our watch," and we have steadfastly looked at all of the elements that need to be improved and enhanced in border security and aviation security to ensure that there are documents that can be, on their face, the kind of document that provides the necessary review and protection for the traveling public and  for those who do business in the ports of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5982">H.R. 5982</bill>, the Biometric Enhancement Act for Airport-Risk Reduction Act of 2008, introduced by my distinguished colleague from Mississippi, Chairman Thompson. This important legislation requires TSA to provide Congress and airport operators with a breakdown on best practices for utilizing biometrics to better protect airports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last few months, the Transportation Security Administration, TSA, has unveiled several new programs and initiatives that are proving to build a "layered approach" to security. And while the TSA is responsible for the 450 U.S. airports, and employs approximately 50,000, with the very important mission of keeping the traveling public safe from terrorist threats, it has done very little to strengthen airport security for workers with unescorted access to sterile and secure areas of the  airport. At the present time, there are few mechanisms in place to ensure that contracted employees follow due diligence at our airports and access is granted to only those employees who belong on airport grounds at any given time. This legislation addresses these key issues by requiring TSA to provide Congress and airport operators with a breakdown on best practices for utilizing biometrics to better protect airports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, only last November, Federal law enforcement raided Chicago's O'Hare International Airport in November 2007  and arrested 23 people for fraudulently securing badges to gain access to sensitive airport locations. According to the charging affidavit, more than 100 temporary workers were found to be in possession of the fraudulent badges and the staffing agency that sponsored these workers told them that they needed identification, but such identification did not have to be legitimate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While today's workers with unescorted access to this critical infrastructure go through background screening, which includes terror watch list checks, to get issued badges, more must be done. While this is a necessary and important check, a job applicant's biometrics are not being captured to check against biographic information provided to establish the individual's identity. The legislation we have before us today is a smart security approach that promotes collaboration between TSA, industry,  labor and other key stakeholders to work together to collectively develop and provide airports with a blueprint on how to make biometrics work for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation requires TSA to study how airports can transition to uniform, standards-based and interoperable biometric identifier systems for airport workers with unescorted access. This bill furthermore requires TSA and the working group to examine  existing programs, such as TWIC, and identify approaches on how biometrics can enhance protections for secure and sterile areas of the airport. TSA is also required by this bill to provide  Congress and airport operators with a breakdown on best practices for using biometrics to improve airport security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill is not about re-inventing the wheel or putting a stop to any good work at TSA on this issue. It is about encouraging public-private partnerships and promoting an open dialogue between TSA, industry, and Congress on how best to secure our airports. I am proud to support this important and timely legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in so doing.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>I wanted to rise to thank our chairman for your important work on this issue. We have worked together on 100 percent screening of workers at airports, and now, there is a pilot project in place for seven of those airports, and we know that in three they are doing 100 percent screening. And at the others, they're looking at other methods, and one of the methods that they are seriously considering and some are using are the issue of biometrics because it is so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I do want to thank the chairman for your leadership on this issue, and I look forward to following the work of the seven airports. Hopefully, we'll be able to spread it to all of our airports.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, again, in closing, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5982">H.R. 5982</bill>, the BEAR Act, the Biometric Enhancement for Airport-Risk Reduction Act, brought to us by the chairman of this committee. This is an advancement. This is a push to where we need to go with respect to biometrics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We ought to understand that the United States is the leader in the world in technology and technology application. We need to do that here as well. And it sometimes seems strange that we don't take advantage of the leadership that we have in applying it to certain areas. The urgency that we need to adopt with respect to the threat that is out there is, I think, shared by this committee, but I'm not sure that it is shared totally by the full Congress, nor by the Federal establishment all together  nor, in some cases, by the American people, where, after our successes in forestalling any major terrorist attack on our shores since 9/11, it allows us a certain relaxation that I think is dangerous. The gentleman moves us in the right direction with this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might say that as we move with this bill I would hope we would move with some other bills on this floor dealing with the threat that we have to our national economy and our national security through our energy dependence on many, many others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. is the leader in the potential for oil shale, just as we're the leader in technology in this world. The U.S. might be called the Saudi Arabia of oil shale. According to the Department of Energy, this Nation is endowed with more than 2 trillion barrels of oil. To put this figure in perspective, the world has used 1 trillion barrels of oil since the first oil well was successfully drilled in Pennsylvania in 1859. According to the Department of Energy, let me repeat, we are endowed with  more than 2 trillion barrels of oil, and we're talking about U.S. oil shale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is that we had a rider on an appropriations bill just last year that makes this huge domestic resource off-limits. That would be as silly as us having a bill on the floor that would say, even though we're the leader in biometric technology, we will prohibit its use in the area of airport security. That would make no sense, Mr. Speaker, nor does it make sense for us not to utilize this tremendous resource we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So again, Mr. Speaker, I would say that I would encourage all Members to support <bill type="h" number="5982">H.R. 5982</bill>, the Biometric Enhancement for Airport-Risk Reduction Act, otherwise known as the BEAR Act, brought to us on this floor by the distinguished gentleman from Mississippi, the chairman of our committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this commonsense approach to studying how biometrics can be used to improve airport security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is important to make clear again, this bill does not create any new mandates on airports. This bill does not require airports to use biometric identifying systems. Instead, it only provides for a study of how biometrics could be used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly believe that strategic deployment of biometrics in the airport is a sensible part of any layered security plan for the airport environment. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and make our airports safer.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="5982">H.R. 5982</bill>, Chairman THOMPSON's legislation that would take an important step toward improving airport security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 9/11, Congress and the airline industry have taken strong actions to tighten security at our nation's airports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These measures have included the creation of the TSA, the expansion of the air marshal service, and the full screening of airline passengers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Thompson's proposal before us today would build upon these early efforts by implementing a study on the use of biometrics in identifying airport workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As TSA continues to look for ways to ensure that airport workers--in addition to passengers--do not pose security risks, pursuing biometrics is a timely and necessary effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, pursuing biometrics would also enhance efforts to conduct 100 percent screening of airport workers with access to secure parts of an airport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Nita Lowey and I have long supported 100 percent screening of airport workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier in this Congress, we were proud to introduce and pass <bill type="h" number="1413">H.R. 1413</bill>, a bill to establish a pilot program to test such worker screening at a number of airports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just recently, TSA launched a pilot similar to the program outlined in our bill, and I look forward to learning the results of this important test upon its completion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, no one wants more bureaucracy for bureaucracy's sake, but Congress needs to look continuously for ways to improve protection for the traveling public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As 9/11 so painfully taught us, we must resolve our security weaknesses before terrorists exploit the remaining gaps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="5982">H.R. 5982</bill>.</paragraph>
