    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business, with Senators allowed to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each. At 2 p.m., we are going to begin the consideration of the minimum wage bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Thursday, prior to action being concluded on the ethics bill, Senator Gregg and I engaged in a colloquy on his plan to offer an amendment to the minimum wage bill which relates to enhanced rescissions. Some call it line-item veto. That amendment is expected to be offered today. Cloture will be filed on that amendment, as I told him I would do, setting up a cloture vote for Wednesday. I advise all Members that we may even do it sooner. It is up to Senator Gregg. We talked  about that a little last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be no rollcall votes today. I expect we will have a vote prior to the caucuses tomorrow. Also, tomorrow evening is the State of the Union Address by President Bush. We will be in recess around 6 p.m. and will reassemble at 8:30 p.m. so that at 8:40 we can proceed to the House Chamber to receive the President's State of the Union Message.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that during morning business today, Senator Dorgan be recognized for up to 30 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
