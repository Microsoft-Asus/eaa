    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Presidential Records Act Amendments of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Presidential Records Act of 1978 declared a President's papers were the property of the people of the United States and were to be administered by the National Archives and Records Administration. The act provided that Presidential papers would be available 12 years after a President left office, allowing the former or incumbent President the right to claim executive privilege for particularly sensitive documents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to fulfill that mandate--that mandate that was in the 1978 law--President Reagan, in 1989, signed Executive Order 12667, which gave the former or incumbent President 30 days to claim executive privilege.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, in 2001, early in his administration, President Bush issued Executive Order 13233, and this executive order by President Bush nullified President Reagan's order and imposed new regulations for obtaining Presidential and Vice Presidential documents. President Bush's new order greatly restricts access to Presidential papers by requiring that all requests for documents, no matter how innocuous, be approved by both the former President, whose papers are involved, and also by the current  White House occupant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no time limit to the White House review, and the right to review and assert executive privilege has been extended by President Bush in his Executive order to include the Vice President and to include Presidential family members. In this way, the order goes against the spirit of the Presidential Records Act and against the letter of the Presidential Records Act by creating a presumption of nondisclosure and expanding the executive privilege claim, thus allowing the White House to prevent  the release of records literally for generations in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1255">H.R. 1255</bill>, the Presidential Records Act Amendments of 2007--which is the bill I came to the floor to speak about--was passed in the House by a vote of 333 to 93 on June 20 of this year. I introduced a similar bill, <bill type="s" number="886">S. 886</bill>, in March of this year in the Senate. The bill I introduced is a bipartisan bill which is cosponsored by Senators CORNYN, LEAHY, SUNUNU, FEINSTEIN, and OBAMA. Two weeks ago, Senator Feinstein sought unanimous consent for the Senate to proceed to <bill type="h" number="1255">H.R. 1255</bill>,  but an objection was heard from another Senator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1255">H.R. 1255</bill> is a bipartisan bill that merely seeks to clarify the process under which the Presidential Records Act is to be implemented. The bill seeks to nullify President Bush's Executive order by limiting claims of executive privilege to the President and to former Presidents in requiring that the President notify the Archivist of any claims of executive privilege within 60 days preceding a notice of a request for a document with an additional 30 days if requested. These measures essentially  return the process to the procedural framework that had been in place since President Reagan issued his original Executive order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important matter that deserves to be brought to a vote in the Senate. There is strong bipartisan support for the reasonable approach to the Presidential Records Act that is contained in <bill type="h" number="1255">H.R. 1255</bill>. Now is not the time, in my view, for political ploys but for, instead, a thoughtful debate and an ultimate vote on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two weeks ago, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Executive Order 13233 is, in part--this is the Executive order President Bush entered--invalid in requiring the Archivist of the United States to delay release of the records of former Presidents at their request as permitted under the order. The Court found that the Archivist's reliance on section 3(b) of that Executive order is without constitutional basis and violates the Administrative Procedures Act. This holding  gives us clear direction in legislatively addressing the problems that have arisen as a result of Executive Order 13233.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Presidential Records Act, there is a clear and an unequivocal assumption that the records of a President's administration belong to the people of this Nation, barring the national security interests or an executive privilege claim. The people of this Nation hired the President. His work is undertaken on behalf of the people. Can anyone doubt that the Nation is made stronger and our Government and the electorate are better served by the study of the actions of past Presidents? This is  not a matter of trying to uncover dark secrets; rather, it is in everyone's interests and certainly in the interests of this Nation that scholars, students, and the public have access to the records of former Presidents in order to fully understand and appreciate the work of those Presidents and to provide guidance for future Presidents and future administrations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge that <bill type="h" number="1255">H.R. 1255</bill> be brought to the Senate floor for debate and for ultimate passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, would the Senator withhold?</paragraph>
