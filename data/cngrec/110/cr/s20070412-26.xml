    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to commend Tom Gary of Greenwood, MS, for his distinguished service during the past year as president of the Delta Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Delta Council is an economic development organization representing the business, professional, and agricultural leadership of the 18 delta and part-delta counties of Northwest Mississippi. Delta Council was organized in 1935 to help meet the challenges which confronted this region of our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A major concern of the Mississippi Delta was the impact of Mississippi River and tributary flooding. Flood protection and drainage have severely challenged the delta region throughout its history. This is an area of concern where Tom Gary has distinguished himself as a leader. Tom took the leadership of the Delta Council Flood Control Committee following a serious delta flood in 1991 and led the effort to accelerate construction and completion of all Yazoo Basin projects. The 1991 flood inundated  more than 1.1 million acres in 15 delta towns; and it seriously damaged schools, roads, public facilities and cropland. After Gary's term as Flood Control Committee chairman, cities such as Greenville, the largest town in north Mississippi, received benefits that will provide 100-year flood protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom serves as vice president of Delta Wildlife, chairman of the Leflore County Farm Service Agency Committee, commissioner and treasurer of the Leflore County Soil and Water Conservation Commission, director of the Business and Industry Political Education Committee and as the Cotton Board director of Farmers Supply Cooperative. He was also appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture as a member of the Cotton Board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through his work with Delta Council, Tom has become a strong advocate and effective leader in advancing Delta Council's mission in adult literacy, the fight against critical teacher shortages in the primary and secondary school system, improved access to health care, and in transportation developments which are so vital to the delta region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Tom Gary and his wife Moxie for the contribution they have made to the delta through their service in Delta Council during the past year.</paragraph>
