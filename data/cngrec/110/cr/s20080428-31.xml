  <speaking speaker="300070" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor the memory of an outstanding Hoosier, IN, State senator, David C. Ford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representing Senate District 19, David Ford served in the Indiana Senate from 1994 until his death from pancreatic cancer on March 5, 2008. His colleagues in the Indiana Senate have lost a dear friend and insightful leader. Public officials across the State will remember him as a tireless advocate for technological innovation. However, the breath of his knowledge extended to education, agriculture, and judiciary policy as well. In short, he was an able and devoted legislator who performed his  duties with intelligence, vigor, and integrity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to being elected to the Indiana Senate, David Ford served as prosecutor in Blackford County, IN. He was also an accomplished pilot, an active member of the American Agriculture Law Association, a board member of Dollars for Scholars, and the recipient of many State and national awards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember many wonderful visits with David over the years. I was always grateful for his wisdom and counsel, and I hope you will join me in paying tribute to State Senator Ford. May his wife Joyce and his many friends and family members continue to find love and comfort in the memory he has left us.</paragraph>
