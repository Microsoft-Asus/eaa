  <narrative> Whereas Congressman William Kent of California recognized the transcendent beauty and national significance of the coastal redwood trees and he set aside his private land for future generations;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Congressman Kent donated his lands to be known as Muir Woods in the State of California as the first National monument, presenting them to the United States Government as a gift to the people of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Muir Woods provides a keystone for conservation stewardship and a rich natural laboratory to explore the philosophy of its namesake, the admired conservation activist John Muir;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Muir Woods was recognized 100 years ago to be "of extraordinary scientific interest and importance because of the primeval character of the forest and the character, age and size of the trees";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Kent donation made it possible for President Theodore Roosevelt to exercise one of the Nation's most unique preservation tools, the Antiquities Act, by declaring Muir Woods National Monument for the American people;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Muir Woods National Monument is preserved today through the dedicated staff and volunteers of the National Park Service;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on May 19, 1945 international delegates to the historic Charter Convention of the United Nations met in the beauty and peace of Muir Wood's Cathedral Grove to open the convention and honor the memory of the late President Franklin D.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Resolution 868, introduced by our colleague from California, Representative LYNN WOOLSEY, recognizes the beauty and the significance of Muir Woods National Monument on its 100th anniversary. Muir Woods National Monument preserves one of the last remaining ancient redwood forests on the Pacific Coast and in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The coast redwood is the tallest species of tree in the world and one of the oldest. The mature trees of the Cathedral and Bohemian groves in Muir Woods reach heights of 250 feet and average between 600 and 800 years in age, with the oldest believed to be at least 1,100 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1905, Congressman William Kent, who later went on to introduce the bill that would establish the National Park Service, purchased the land where Muir Woods stands, recognizing the beauty, value, and significance of an uncut, old-growth redwood forest. Eventually, Congressman Kent donated 295 acres to the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 9, 1908, using the Antiquities Act, President Roosevelt declared Kent's donated land a national monument, proclaiming that the groves of the redwoods were of "extraordinary scientific interest and importance because of the unique character of the forests and the character, age, and size of the trees."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Roosevelt wanted to name the new monument for Congressman Kent, but Kent insisted that it be named after the venerable conservationist John Muir, who sought to protect some of America's most iconic landscapes for their inherent national beauty. These ancient trees now offer a silent, yet powerful, testimony to Muir's ideals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend and congratulate my colleague Representative Woolsey, for her commitment and leadership on this matter. We strongly support passage of House Resolution 868 and urge its adoption by the House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey), the sponsor of the bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400436" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my district, just across the Golden Gate Bridge north of San Francisco, includes 100 percent of Marin County and 80 percent of Sonoma County, where we are blessed with many environmental treasures. In fact, it is one of the most beautiful places on Earth, and it is just across the bridge from one of the largest cities in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this area we have a stand of old-growth redwoods known as Muir Woods, and we consider this our crown jewel. Muir Woods is nearly 300 acres of what I refer to as "Heaven on Earth" where its natural beauty has been preserved and protected for everyone to enjoy so that we can enjoy the trees, which are mostly redwoods that stand over 250 feet tall and are, as the chairman just told you, as old as 1,100 years. That is why I am so pleased that Congress is considering <bill type="hr" number="868">H. Res. 868</bill> today, to celebrate  the 100th anniversary of President Teddy Roosevelt's declaration of Muir Woods as a national monument.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is fitting that we honor the centennial of Muir Woods on the floor of the House of Representatives, because it was the actions of Congressman William Kent who represented Marin County at that time who made the national monument possible. William Kent privately owned the land where Muir Woods now stands, and he and his family donated it to the Federal Government to ensure its protection. I am proud to say that 100 years later Congressman Kent's vision is still going strong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The leadership in conservation that William Kent showed 100 years ago is a valuable lesson for us today. Imagine all the national wonder that could have been saved in the last 100 years, wonders like Muir Woods, that we could be enjoying today had more people been as selfless as he. We in Congress have the power to ensure that 100 years from now people can look back and applaud new conservation efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Muir Woods is a unique sanctuary for the protection of one of Earth's greatest wonders, the coastal redwoods; and its preservation is to be commended. I want to thank Chairman Rahall, Chairman Grijalva, Ranking Member Young, and Mr. Bishop for bringing my resolution here to the floor today, because working together, Mr. Speaker, working together today, we will ensure that 100 years from now our grandchildren, our great grandchildren and their children  will enjoy the Muir Woods bicentennial.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="868">H.R. 868</bill>, honoring the 100 year anniversary of the Muir Woods National Monument.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his life, John Muir was concerned with protecting nature to enhance the spiritual side of civilization and progress. His words and deeds led to the establishment of the U.S. National Park System. In addition, John Muir was the founding president of the Sierra Club, which remains one of the leading American grassroots organization for protecting wilderness and the human environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 9, 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared the Muir Woods America's 10th National Monument. When he heard of President Roosevelt's act Muir wrote, "This is the best tree-lover's monument that could possibly be found in all the forests of the world."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Muir Woods attracts about 1 million people every year, and inspires them with redwoods over 260 feet high and more than 1,200 years old. Part of the Golden Gate National Parks, Muir Woods is a living and enduring symbol of John Muir's conservation ethic that nature must be preserved if humanity is to continue to thrive on this planet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and honor the legacy of a great American, his vision of environmental conservation, and the truly remarkable Muir Woods National Monument.</paragraph>
