  <narrative>APPROVE THE U.S.-COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2018]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400176" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, now that the Colombia trade agreement is before Congress, I hope that all Members will weigh its benefits carefully and approve it with a strong bipartisan up-or-down vote. The United States is the largest manufacturer and exporter in the world and new markets are essential to our workers, 42 percent of whom are employed by companies that are involved with trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Colombia trade agreement would level the playing field for American workers and grant our exporters the same fair access that Colombian producers already enjoy into the U.S. market. It would also strategically strengthen Colombia's fight against narcoterrorists and help them reject the influence of Venezuela's anti-American strong man, Hugo Chavez.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge support of the U.S.-Colombia TPA.</paragraph>
