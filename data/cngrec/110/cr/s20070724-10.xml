  <narrative>WOUNDED WARRIOR AMENDMENT -- (Senate - July 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9796">S9796</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, before I leave the podium, I wish to say a couple words about another important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, Americans were shocked by reports of the crisis at Walter Reed and other armed services medical facilities. It wasn't just Walter Reed, but that was the picture everyone saw. We learned that many of our courageous men and women wounded in service to our Nation were receiving unacceptably poor treatment and care upon their return to our shores.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I learned from this morning's news that there is a big lawsuit filed by Afghan and Iraqi veterans. Hundreds of thousands have joined together in a lawsuit against the Veterans' Administration. I do not procedurally understand how that is going to go forward, but it was in the morning headline news.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is now, according to this news report, about a half a million backlog requests for Iraqi veterans to get care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We learned during the early look at Walter Reed and other facilities not only was the veterans' care system ripe for bureaucratic failures, but even the physical facilities failed to meet a minimal level of acceptable quality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people were outraged by these facts, and I am glad to say the Senate took prompt action. The Armed Services and Veterans' Affairs Committees held a rare joint hearing to identify the best ways to make right the existing failures and to prevent similar injustices from ever happening again. Members of these committees  worked together in an entirely bipartisan manner. Last month, they introduced the Wounded Warriors bill, which was entered  as an amendment to the Defense authorization bill. The Wounded Warrior amendment addresses the substandard facilities, which we have all read about and have visited, such as Walter Reed, and the lack of seamless transition when medical care for troops is transferred from the Department of Defense to the Veterans' Administration, which often leads to diminished care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation also looks at the inadequacy of severance pay to help those who have sacrificed so much already to support their families while they recover, and the need to improve sharing of medical records between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It addresses the inadequate care and treatment for traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress syndrome by authorizing $50 million for improved diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation. We saw this problem highlighted, as I have indicated, in the morning news. There are a number of stories about that, but the main story is in the L.A. Times, which cited a report by a special Pentagon task force showing that 38 percent of soldiers and 50 percent of National Guard members come home from Iraq  and Afghanistan with mental health issues. Yet only 27 of these 1,400 VA hospitals have inpatient post-traumatic stress disorder programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the Wounded Warrior legislation provides support for wounded troops whose health insurance programs, such as the TRICARE program for retired veterans, have allowed gaps in medical coverage and treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the next few days, I intend to take the Wounded Warrior amendment from the Defense authorization bill--there were additions made to that from the time it left committee--and I will seek unanimous consent that we pass it now. The rest of it, with rare exception in the Defense authorization bill, if we passed it yesterday, wouldn't kick in until the beginning of the fiscal year. But the Wounded Warrior amendment legislation becomes law upon passage and approval. I hope we can do that. This would  make these provisions immediately effective when the President signs this. Given the immediate care these people need, and the immediate need to act on the Wounded Warrior amendment, which has overwhelming bipartisan support, I am hoping we can all work together to pass it before we leave here. If we have to do it by unanimous consent, I hope we can do that.</paragraph>
