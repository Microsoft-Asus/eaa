  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, prior to this job as Democratic leader, I basically lived on the floor for 6 years. I was here from the time the Senate came into session until we went out every day. During that period of time, I got to know staff up here very well because I basically lived with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the people whom I certainly have gotten to know over that period of time is a man by the name of Jack Hickman. Since 1996, Jack has worked in the Senate Document Room, has been the executive communications clerk, and is now the morning business editor. When he is here, he sits at the table right in front of me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack is physically a giant of a man, very big. He has a wonderful sense of humor and is very easy to get along with. He loves his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin. One of his sad times was when UNLV beat them once, which was unexpected in a lot of quarters. He follows Wisconsin basketball and all of their sports teams very closely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack has two sons, Paul and Brian. His wife's name is Margaret, and he brags about her all the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want the Record to be spread with the fact that it has been an enjoyable experience for me to be able to work with someone of Jack's caliber, to be able to joke with him and make fun of each other in a respectful way on some of our idiosyncracies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack Hickman is going to retire. Tomorrow is his last day here. He and his wife had purchased a place in Florida some time ago. He has been going down there on vacation in our off times. Now he will live there full time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack does, as do all of the Senate personnel, invaluable work for us. He makes sure what we say goes in the right place in the Record. He works with the court reporters and the rest of the staff. His work, even though it is not very noteworthy to the public, is essential to the Senate functioning properly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will really miss Jack a lot. He is someone with whom I have a real strong comfort level. I look forward, in the years to come, to being able to visit with him again and talk about some of the times we have had. We have spent many hours together on the Senate floor. During those years, I didn't control what we did; I was just here on the floor. We waited for long periods of time for the leader--whether it was a Democratic or Republican leader--to come and take us out at the end of the day. We  complained to each other, saying, "I wonder what they are doing." Well, since I got this job, I have a better picture of that. Even though it appears there is nothing going on out here, a lot of times, in the respective leaders' offices, a lot is going on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I speak about Jack, but in the process I speak of all these people who do so much for us and make us look good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish Jack good luck in his retirement.</paragraph>
