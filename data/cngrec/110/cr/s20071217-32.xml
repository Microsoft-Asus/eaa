    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate the work by my colleague, Senator Feinstein, who chairs the Committee on Rules and Administration, and by other Senators over many years to accomplish this merger of the U.S. Capitol Police and the Library of Congress Police.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Capitol Police and Library of Congress Police Merger and Implementation Act of 2007 provides that employees of the Library of Congress Police shall be transferred to the United States Capitol Police. I would like to ask my colleague Senator Feinstein about provisions under which the Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police will make certain final determinations regarding the incoming Library of Congress Police employees that shall not be appealable or reviewable in any manner. It is  my understanding that these provisions would generally prevent individuals from appealing or seeking review of the determinations of the Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police, but would not limit the right of any individual to seek any appropriate relief under the Congressional Accountability Act if these determinations by the Chief allegedly violated that act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congressional Accountability Act was enacted in 1995 to provide to congressional employees the same rights and protections that are available to other employees in our Nation, including protection against discrimination on the basis of race, sex, national origin, religion, or age. My understanding is that the merger legislation would in no way limit the right of any employee covered under the Congressional Accountability Act to initiate an action regarding any alleged violation of rights  protected under that Act. I have also been told that this interpretation of the legislation is shared by the Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police, and that Library of Congress employees transferring to the U.S. Capitol Police will be informed and educated about their rights and protections under the Congressional Accountability Act.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The understanding of my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, is correct. The finality provisions in this legislation were intended to give the Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police authority to transfer employees and assign duties as necessary to meet the mission of the U.S. Capitol Police in maintaining the security of the Capitol complex. However, the provisions in this legislation in no way limit the protections and rights of an employee to seek relief under the  Congressional Accountability Act.</paragraph>
