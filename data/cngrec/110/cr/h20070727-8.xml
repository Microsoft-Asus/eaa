  <speaking speaker="400647" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, early this morning the Children's Health Insurance and Medicare Protection Act, which extends access to quality care for both our Nation's children and our Nation's seniors, was passed out of committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this important legislation, we are wisely investing in the Children's Health Insurance Program to protect and extend access to health coverage for millions of America's uninsured children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In its 10-year history, CHIP has had strong bipartisan support not only because of what it accomplishes but how it meets its goal, with a flexible, cost-effective market approach to access to health insurance. Yet it has become the object of scorn by this President and with Republican leaders in Congress forcefully opposing this successful public-private partnership which enables literally millions of hardworking American families to buy private health insurance for their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this legislation strengthens and sustains Medicare for American seniors by securing payments for physicians and quality, innovative health care options for seniors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Protecting Medicare and extending CHIP is the best opportunity this Congress has to address the need for affordable quality health insurance for Americans.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
