    <paragraph>Mr. President, over 5 years ago, on September 11, terrorists murdered nearly 3,000 people in the single deadliest attack on American soil in our history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What all Americans witnessed and what too many families experienced personally and tragically was the dawn of a new era. We knew it then. National Guard patrolled Federal buildings and airports. The military patrolled the skies over New York and Washington, DC. The United States had been attacked by a new kind of enemy in a new and more dangerous world. We faced tough questions as a nation: How do we defeat this enemy? How do we fight terror abroad and protect America at home?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What was clear that day and remains so today is that the threat posed to us by terrorism requires a great mobilization of American might, muscle, resources, and ingenuity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Armed with this mandate, many of us fought alongside those who lost loved ones on September 11 to compel an unwilling Bush administration to create the 9/11 Commission. The determination and steadfastness demonstrated by the families hardest hit by the September 11 tragedy made the 9/11 Commission a reality. We applauded when the bipartisan Commission concluded its investigation and released its thorough report detailing recommendations to protect this Nation from another attack, confident that  the Congress and the administration would in short order implement their recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shamefully, for some in our Federal Government, the sense of urgency and resolve faded in the months and years that followed. Some of the Commission's most commonsense recommendations went ignored. Even in the face of dangerous incompetence in our emergency preparedness and response to Hurricane Katrina, we received tough rhetoric instead of much needed reform. Five years after the 9/11  attacks and 2 1/2  years after the 9/11 Commission released its  initial report, much of the work of properly securing our homeland has gone undone. That is why this legislation to implement many of the remaining recommendations of the 9/11 Commission is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have long supported the Commission's recommendation that "homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities." With our homeland security resources limited, we need to be smart about how we distribute funding to guard against terrorism. Sadly, all too often, funding decisions have been made based on politics in Washington instead of the reality in our cities and neighborhoods. It is why I introduced the Homeland Security Block Grant Act as  well as the Domestic Defense Fund Act, both of which would provide direct and threat-based homeland security funding to our communities and first responders to help them improve our homeland defense. But even funds supposedly distributed based on risk have been administered incompetently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last spring, the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, announced its 2006 homeland security grants. Cities and States across the country facing high terrorist threats suffered considerable funding cuts, a decision which can be largely attributed to a series of highly questionable risk assessments. New York City and Washington, DC, both already the targets of attacks, were slated for drastic reductions. Funding under the Urban Area Security Initiative, UASI, alone was slashed in New York City  by more than 40 percent and in Washington, DC by 43 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We clearly need to get smarter about how we assess risk. It would surprise most people to learn that until now, the process of assessing risk has been done on an ad hoc basis within DHS, with several different offices tasked with contributing to the analysis. This seemingly haphazard process has led to constantly changing grant guidance and formulas, wide fluctuations in yearly grant awards, and a failure to develop a long-term strategy for risk assessment. What we need is a full-time staff of  methodologists whose sole responsibility it is to assess risk. That is why I offered an amendment to bill that would create a Risk Assessment Center within DHS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the funding proposal contained within Improving America's Security Act moves us closer toward a threat-based funding model, it still falls shorts of what the 9/11 Commission recommended. Specifically, the State minimum funding requirements contained within the bill are still too high and there is still too much reliance on population-based formulas that bear little relation to risk. My hope is that during conference committee negotiations to reconcile the House and Senate bills, efforts  will be made to ensure that our limited homeland security funds are directed toward mitigating our most significant vulnerabilities and that political formulas are abandoned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we discuss the importance of homeland security and how critical it is to provide adequate funding for our first responders, we cannot leave the 43,000 transportation security officers, TSOs, in this country out of the conversation. Every day, TSOs are on the national security frontlines, keeping our airports safe and protecting  countless citizens as they travel. Despite the significant training, experience, and patience required to execute these duties, TSOs have lacked the basic workers rights and protections for over 5 years, including whistleblower protections and the right to collectively bargain. As a result, the officers we task with protecting our airplanes from another terrorist attack now have the highest injury rate of any Federal agency, a high attrition rate of almost 30 percent, and, according to a recent  report, the lowest morale of any agency in the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is why I supported Senator MCCASKILL's amendment that would guarantee to TSOs collective bargaining and other basic labor rights that other Federal law enforcement officers already enjoy. This amendment would promote our Nation's security by providing a stable workplace structure for the resolution of disputes and the reduction of turnover, as well as allow TSOs to expose threats to aviation security without fear of retaliation. The amendment also includes provisions that make explicit  that TSOs would not enjoy the right to strike, the right to bargain for higher pay, or the right to reveal classified information, and that the TSOs must follow all orders during an emergency. This was a smart and carefully tailored amendment that correctly recognizes that we will not be able to effectively safeguard our Nation's security if we do not stand with and support its security workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also past time to secure our ports and transportation systems. Unscanned cargo containers that pass through our ports pose a substantial risk to our homeland security, threatening not only the gateways to our national economy but also the larger American public. We learned the painful lesson on September 11 that those intent on destroying our American way of life are keenly focused on exposing our vulnerabilities. Because our ports serve as the gateway to our country and its economy, they  remain attractive targets susceptible to terrorist attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, more than 84 million tons of cargo with a value greater than $132 billion passed through the Port of New York and New Jersey alone. The sheer scope of commerce at our ports means the threat carries grave consequences--and will take a great deal of hard work and our smartest strategies to meet. And while we took important steps toward addressing these concerns last year with the passage of the SAFE Ports Act, we still need to act with more urgency. It is why I supported efforts to expedite  the implementation of new scanning requirements during consideration of the Improving America's Security Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am encouraged that the bill does take steps to secure our rail and mass transit systems. Given the lessons of London, Madrid, and Mumbai, it is unbelievable that not more has been done to secure our mass transit. Passenger rail systems--primarily subway systems--here in the United States carry about 5 times as many passengers each day as do airlines. Instead of forcing an impossible decision, between protecting one form of transportation over another, we should invest in the resources and tools  necessary to secure our entire transportation infrastructure--before terrorists strike our rail systems here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Importantly, the bill provides grants through TSA to Amtrak, freight railraods, and others to upgrade security across the entire freight and intercity passenger railroad system. Additionally, the bill provides funding through the Department of Transportation, DOT, to upgrade and to fortify Amtrak railroad tunnels in New York, Washington, and Baltimore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the legislation requires the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, FMCSA, to provide recommendations to both motor carriers and States on how to coordinate hazardous materials routing. The bill also requires DHS to develop a program to encourage equipping trucks that carry hazardous materials with communications and tracking technology. These steps are in addition to those in the bill that bolster aviation security standards. Importantly, the bill requires the Transportation  Security Administration, TSA, to develop and implement a system, within 3 years of the date of enactment, to provide for the screening of all cargo being carried on passenger aircraft, a security measure that is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also takes several important steps to address our emergency communications systems before we face another crisis. Chaotic, real-world disasters, whether manmade or natural, do not obey borders. They require close coordination of Federal, State and local agencies, firefighters, police officers and EMTs, and others. Yet often these different entities use different communications devices, frequencies, even languages. On September 11, police officers could not effectively talk to firefighters  at Ground Zero; at the Pentagon, first responders from Virginia and Washington, DC faced the same problem. After Katrina, we had responders exchanging business cards at the site of the disaster along the gulf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why the 9/11 Commission recognized our crucial need to have interoperable communications, so that all  of our first responders can communicate with each other at the scene of an emergency. It is why I introduced legislation last year that would give our first responders an interoperable emergency communications system coordinated under Federal leadership. I am pleased that the bill provides funds to improve interoperable emergency communications  and gives the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, NTIA, greater direction regarding how to distribute these funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also contains a provision offered by Senator STEVENS and me which will provide immediate and critical funding to help upgrade and improve our Nation's 9-1-1 call centers. This funding will help ensure that 9-1-1 call centers can be an effective part of an emergency response plan and will make certain they have the technological upgrades to handle and process all the emergency calls that come into them so that our first responders know where to go and what situation they are walking  into.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 5 years ago, America suffered a brutal terrorist attack that stole nearly 3,000 lives and changed America forever. What was required here in Washington was leadership. Leadership to inspire Americans to meet the threat head on. Leadership to mobilize our resources and respond effectively. Leadership to keep our country safe in a new and more dangerous world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, the Bush administration failed to match the urgency and resolve of the American people in this great struggle to secure our homeland. Today, with passage of this important legislation, we will demonstrate the leadership that we have been sorely missing for too long in the fight to safeguard our Nation and its citizens.</paragraph>
