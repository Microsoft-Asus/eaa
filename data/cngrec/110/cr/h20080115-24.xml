    <paragraph>Today, Madam Speaker, we have the honor of celebrating the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King. I am reminded of the 40th year of his death and what he was committed to, that is, the equality of all people, the economic equality. And that is why in 1968 he was bringing to Washington poor people from around America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for an economic stimulus package, and the United States Congress must respond to the pain of the American people who are losing their homes. An immediate moratorium on those who are being foreclosed on, an infusion of capital to help them save their homes, and a freeze on the adjustable rates of these individuals who are suffering, who have invested in their homes, paid for their homes, and are the victims of scandalous and unscrupulous individuals who would take advantage of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us keep the dream alive and fight for those who have invested in the American Dream. Let us put forward an economic stimulus package that will save the American people and their homes and really say that America is going toward the promised land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Happy birthday, Dr. Martin Luther King. Thank you so very much for all that you have done for all America.</paragraph>
