    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, from Congress Daily AM on Monday, 21 April, the heading was: Florida delight as talks intensify behind closed doors on several issues. Members negotiate behind the scenes to finish a farm bill conference and plan their maneuvers for moving a war supplemental bill and more possible tradeoffs to move a Colombia Free Trade Agreement. Funny. No talk about gasoline, no talk about the high energy prices. The number one issue affecting consumers today and the pocketbooks of  mom and dad and driving kids to events is the high cost of gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When this majority took over, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $58.31. Today--actually, this is wrong--it was updated at $117. It did get to $118 a barrel. When you don't have a plan, you plan to fail. I would hope that the Democrat majority would, in their negotiations, talk about how they are going to address the high cost of energy in this country.</paragraph>
