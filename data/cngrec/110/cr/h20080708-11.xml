    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while the Democrat Congress sits on its hands, House Republicans are answering the challenge of $4 gas, taking our meaningful solutions to produce American-made energy, lower gas prices and promote energy independence directly to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the French people were starving, the Queen said, "Let them eat cake." Speaker Pelosi's office says, "Right now our strategy on gas prices is drive small cars and wait for the wind."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people can't wait for the Democrats to decide what to do. They want answers now, and Republicans stand ready with solutions. The Republican plan will increase production of American-made energy in an environmentally safe way. It will promote new, clean, and reliable sources of energy while cutting red tape and increasing the supply of American-made fuel and energy. The House Republican plan also encourages greater energy efficiency by offering conservative tax credits to Americans  who make their home, car and business more energy efficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So while Democrats continue to sit on the sidelines, House Republicans will continue to fight for meaningful solutions to lower gas prices and promote energy independence.</paragraph>
