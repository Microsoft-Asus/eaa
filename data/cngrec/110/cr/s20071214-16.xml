  <narrative>FAIR TREATMENT FOR EXPERIENCED PILOTS ACT -- (Senate - December 14, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="15619">S15619</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor today to thank Congress for finally raising the mandatory retirement age for commercial airline pilots from age 60 to age 65. This language was included as part of the "Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act," and allows our most experienced commercial pilots to continue providing safe air transportation for the Nation. The House approved the bill unanimously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1960, the FAA "Age 60 Rule" has restricted pilots age 60 and older from serving on any commercial flight operations. Under the rule, it is estimated that our aviation system lost 50 pilots every week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many in the aviation community, the FAA, and now Congress, have reacted to the realization that the Age 60 Rule has become outdated and discriminatory against one of Alaska's greatest resources, its experienced and seasoned pilots.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues in the Senate know, the State of Alaska depends on aviation more than any other State. In our State we find that 50 percent of the commercial pilots are over 55.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The lack of highway infrastructure creates a situation where aviation serves as the traditional road system. More than 70 percent of our communities can only be reached year around by air, making aircraft essential for personal, commercial, cargo, and mail transportation to most parts of our State. Having experienced pilots to deliver goods and services to our communities is essential for Alaskans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of our pilots contacted me and told me how the Age 60 Rule was impacting them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, on Wednesday, I met with Gary Miller, a Vietnam veteran and current FedEx pilot based in Anchorage. If Congress would not have acted on this outdated regulation, Gary would have been forced to retire in February.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, there are pilots like Captain Bill Green, one of Alaska's best Hercules pilots. The Hercules aircraft are used for transporting large cargo shipments. Captain Green turns 60 next April and would have been forced into retirement, despite the need for qualified, experienced pilots in Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mike Redmond, who has experience flying every type of aircraft used in Alaska--in 2 years he will be 60 years old and under the Age 60 Rule Alaskans would have lost his wealth of knowledge and experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have supported changing this rule for more than a decade, and I applaud the Senate's actions in finally taking hold and raising the age to 65.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These pilots are our most experienced aviators and are a valuable resource to the commercial aviation industry. This action today will allow them to continue serving our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is rare that Congress passes legislation that has such an immediate personal impact on our citizens. This is a proud moment for me and for the Congress. I am proud to say the President signed this bill immediately when he received it last night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.</chair>
