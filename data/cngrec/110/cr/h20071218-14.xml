  <narrative>THE FIRST STEP TOWARD COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY LEGISLATION -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H16648]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412188" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a historic first step for this United States Congress; it's a step towards energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The energy bill that we're considering today recognizes a tremendous renewable resource that we literally have at our fingertips, the power of the sun. This bill includes my provisions to authorize new research and development into solar technologies. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize our energy production, not just in southern Arizona, but across this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we develop these new technologies, we're going to need qualified workers to install and maintain the latest solar technologies. That is why this bill includes training programs specifically for solar technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this bill is only a first step. I'm disappointed that we're not passing the House's fiscally responsible renewable energy tax policies and the tax incentives that go with this legislation. Those are the incentives that are really going to spur energy innovation, so we're going to continue to work for those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support this bill today, but we have a lot more work that we have to do. Mr. Speaker, I urge support on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
