    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="2077">H.R. 2077</bill>, which names the postal facility in Blue Creek, Ohio, after George B. Lewis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2077">H.R. 2077</bill> was introduced by Representative Jean Schmidt on April 30, 2007, and was reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1, 2007, by a voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure, which has been cosponsored by 16 Members, has the support of the entire Ohio congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>George Lewis began his career in public service with the Federal Government on February 1, 1946, when he enlisted in the United States Navy. After his discharge from the Navy, George returned from Adams County to work on the family cattle farm until September 1, 1950, when he was drafted by the Army and sent to Korea. He rose in the ranks quickly, earning the rank of tank sergeant. He was honorably discharged from the Army on June 12, 1952.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>George was hired as the Blue Creek Postmaster on November 5, 1955, where he served ably until his retirement on September 27, 1992.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Jean Schmidt from Ohio, for introducing this legislation, and I urge its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the dedicated public servants working for American citizens in making our neighborhoods a better place in which to live. George B. Lewis, the Blue Creek Postmaster, is one such man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lewis' career serving his country began when he enlisted in the United States Navy in February 1946. He then returned to his work on the family cattle farm in Adams County until September 1950, when at the age of 22 he was drafted by the Army and sent to Korea. In Korea, Lewis was recognized as a leader, and he earned the rank of tank sergeant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Honorably discharged in 1952, Lewis again returned to work on the family farm. Three years later, Lewis was appointed to the position of the Blue Creek Postmaster, a job he held until retirement. Not only did George Lewis serve his community as postmaster for 47 years, but he played a major role in forming the Jefferson Township Volunteer Fire Department and then went on to serve as the chief of that department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was also very active in the community, sitting on the Adams County Hospital Board, the Adams County Agricultural Society and Fair Board director. As the proud father of five children, he also served as the president of the Jefferson Township Parent-Teacher Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lewis died on October 25, 2000, from lung cancer. With his recognized accomplishments in the Armed Forces, his devotion and services to Blue Creek as postmaster, and his longtime record of community service, it is fitting for to us pay tribute to the lifetime achievements of George B. Lewis by naming the Blue Creek Ohio, postal facility in his honor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2077">H.R. 2077</bill>, legislation to name the United States postal facility in Blue Creek, Ohio, the "George B. Lewis Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>George Lewis is the perfect example of what it is to be an American. This is an individual who served his country on the battlefield, and then came back home to serve his country on the farm field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>George Lewis was born on April 22, 1928, in Peebles, Ohio, a farming community in Adams County, the second of five children. George spent his entire life, save 2 years fighting the Korean War, in Adams County, where he devoted his entire life to improve it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>George Lewis began his career in public service with the Federal Government on February 1, 1946, still a few months short of his 18th birthday when he enlisted in the Navy. After his discharge from the Navy, George returned to Adams County to work on the family cattle farm until September 1, 1950, when he was called to duty and drafted into the Army and sent to Korea at the age of 22.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He rose in the ranks quickly, earning the rank of tank sergeant. He saw battle on several occasions and earned several medals and awards for his service. He was honorably discharged in 1952 and returned back to the family farm to do the work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>George was hired as the Blue Creek Postmaster on November 5, 1955, where he served ably until his retirement on September 27, 1992. He was known to all in his community as the Blue Creek Postmaster. He retired with 40 years of Federal Government service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his career as postmaster, George remained active in his community, not just only on the family farm which his family has held for over 200 years. He was instrumental, as was mentioned, in forming the Jefferson Township Volunteer Fire Department, serving as its chief, and was an honorary lifetime member. He also continued in his public service with the Adams County Hospital Board, the Adams County Agricultural Society, the Fair Board director, and was president of the Jefferson Township  Parent-Teacher Association. Lastly, he was a member of the Moores Chapel United Methodist Church.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>George was known as the "go-to guy" because he could fix anything from a tractor to a toaster, and he never said no to anyone. He was known for his willingness to help everyone, friends or strangers, and had a quick wit and a common sense which made him universally respected in his community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>George died on October 25, 2000, after a battle with lung cancer. He was survived by his wife of over 45 years, Juanita, five children and six great-grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>George B. Lewis lived as a humble and practical man. He was not afraid of hard work, hard situations or hard decisions. He faced life with courage, common sense and a feeling of responsibility for Blue Creek, where his entire family still resides to this day on that same family farm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to honor this man and support this legislation.</paragraph>
