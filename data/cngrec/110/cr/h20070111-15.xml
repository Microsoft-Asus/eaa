    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of representing one of the largest congressional districts east of the Mississippi, the West Virginia Second District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the best-kept secrets in West Virginia, and certainly my district, are the wonderful small towns and the sense of community they provide. Treasures like these are worth celebrating every single day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Sunday, the city of Ripley in Jackson County, West Virginia, celebrated its 175th anniversary, and I had the privilege of attending the celebration with the mayor and many fine citizens of Ripley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought it was very fitting to read the city's motto, "Ripley: Proud of our past--Excited about our future."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much has changed in America since 1832 when Ripley was founded, but the fact is that Ripley remains one of the best small towns in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, when the President was looking for a place to celebrate our Nation's birthday in 2002, he looked no further than Ripley, West Virginia. It was a great decision. Every year, Ripley has the largest Independence Day celebration of any small town in America. We welcomed the President, and he enjoyed his West Virginia visit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us all remember that small towns are truly the heart and soul of America, just as they were in 1832 at Ripley's founding. I am honored to represent them here in Washington.</paragraph>
