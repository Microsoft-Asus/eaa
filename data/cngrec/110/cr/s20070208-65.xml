    <paragraph>Today the Senate confirmed the nomination of GEN George Casey to be the Chief of Staff of the Army. Also, we began consideration of the continuing funding resolution, and cloture has been filed on the joint resolution. However, the majority leader has indicated on more than one occasion that we will continue to discuss the parameters of how the Senate will conclude action on the legislation. There will be no rollcall votes Friday, nor will the Senate be in session. Also, there will  not be any rollcall votes Monday. However, we will be in session and continue our discussions about several issues, including the issue of BRAC, which has been the subject of some debate today. Senators are advised that the cloture vote on the funding resolution will occur Tuesday morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, at this point, in deference to the minority leader, to make sure there are not any housekeeping items that should be considered before we close business, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say to my good friend, the assistant Democratic leader, we appreciate the willingness of the majority leader and the Senator from Illinois to consider the amendments that we would like to offer to the continuing resolution. Members on my side of the aisle have been on the Senate floor all afternoon discussing what they believe to be the shortcomings of the continuing resolution as it is currently structured. I appreciate the majority taking a look  at those amendments and allowing us to continue discussion about the appropriateness of making some adjustments to this massive $464 billion bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have also had some conversations with the majority leader about some nominations that we hope to wrap up next week. There is a circuit judge reported out of the Judiciary Committee today. I have an understanding with the majority leader that judge will be confirmed next week. There are some other executive branch nominations that we think should not generate any controversy that, hopefully, we can wrap up before the Lincoln recess.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am looking forward to working with the minority leader on the business ahead. We want to pass this continuing resolution and make sure there is no interruption in the services of our Government. We face an extraordinary challenge because much of the work that we are doing now is work that should have been done previously. But in a positive, constructive, and bipartisan fashion, I am confident we can complete it in time and not risk any possibility of shutting down  the Government. So I look forward, on behalf of the majority leader on our side, to working closely with the minority and its leader.</paragraph>
