    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (<bill type="hr" number="264">H. Res. 264</bill>) supporting the goals and ideals of "National Correctional Officers and Employees Week" and honoring the service of correctional officers and employees.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia?</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="264">H. Res. 264</bill> is a bipartisan resolution designed to honor correctional officers and employees by acknowledging and supporting the goals and ideals of National Correctional Officers and Employees Week. This was introduced by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Holden), the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Ellsworth).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution directly honors correctional workers at all levels, local, State and Federal, including psychologists, chaplains, teachers and even kitchen staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Correctional officers and employees play a vital role in protecting and promoting public safety. They work in our county jails, our State prisons and our Federal penitentiaries. They have a tough job in a tough environment and at a time that Congress and State legislatures are actually making the job more difficult because we have been eliminating programs for inmates, such as parole, good conduct credits and Pell Grants for college courses, programs that give incentives to prisoners to behave.  Now, with the additional reduction in prison inmate jobs on the Federal level, even more pressure will be put on correctional officers to maintain a safe and productive environment for prisoners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is fitting, Mr. Speaker, that we pause at this time to recognize and commend our correctional officers and employees for the very important job that they do for us every day under these very difficult circumstances, and to them we say, "Thank you."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to indicate that I have received a note from the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Holden), the lead sponsor of the resolution and chair of the Congressional Correctional Officers Caucus. First, he asked that I share his regrets that he was not able to be with us today to speak on this resolution due to a prior commitment in his home district. He also asked that I convey his strong support for the men and women who work in our prisons and  correctional facilities on a daily basis. And he also asked me to personally welcome on his behalf the correctional community to Washington, D.C., for their annual day on Capitol Hill, which is scheduled to occur this coming Wednesday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 264, which recognizes National Correctional Officers and Employees Week, and honors the service of correctional officers and employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Few jobs are more dangerous and difficult than serving as a correctional officer. There are over 200,000 correctional officers in the United States who guard us from nearly 2 million criminals and maintain the safety of the Nation's correctional facilities. It is a job with high risk and often little recognition or reward. This resolution recognizes the important role that correctional officers play in maintaining public safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Correctional officers carry a heavy burden each day. They are surrounded by dangerous criminals and work in a stressful environment. We hear about but don't often stop to recognize the hundreds of correctional officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Last year in Maryland, two correctional officers were killed. On January 27, 2006, Correctional Officer Jeffrey Alan Wroten II was brutally shot and killed; and on July 25, 2006, Officer David Warren McGuinn was killed. What happened to these  two Maryland officers unfortunately has happened to hundreds of other correctional officers in past years. Correctional Officer Jeffrey Alan Wroten left behind a wife and five children, the oldest, age 15, and the youngest, 5 years of age. This makes his loss and the loss of others like him even more heartbreaking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, it is appropriate that we take a moment this week to honor the contribution of all correctional officers, pray for their continued safety and dedicate ourselves to helping them carry out their mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We thank each and every correctional officer, their families and loved ones, and honor them for their valuable role in protecting the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to an original cosponsor of this resolution, the former sheriff in Indiana, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Ellsworth).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412206" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the correctional officers and employees from around the country, and to voice my strong support for this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spent almost 25 years in law enforcement, much of that working in a jail myself. And from my experience, correction officers are some of the hardest-working law enforcement professionals that are working today. House Resolution 264 recognizes them for their important contributions to the safety of our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week is National Correctional Officers and Employees Week. The bill we are considering today supports the goals and ideas of this important week, and honors all corrections officers and employees for their service to their communities, their States, and also to this Nation. It also recognizes the critical role that the correctional facilities play in the U.S. criminal justice system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be a cosponsor to this legislation with Congressman Holden and Congressman LoBiondo. I echo Mr. Scott's words. Mr. Holden felt strongly enough about this legislation to call me and ask me to make a few comments on his support for this bill. He was unable to attend this meeting as he had prior commitments in his district, but he asked me to express his strong support for the men and women who work in the correctional system on all the levels, who  work tirelessly to protect their communities from those incarcerated and breaking the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The men and women who work in our prisons and correctional facilities face danger in their everyday lives. I have seen this firsthand. They are outnumbered. They work long hours. They often go without their lunches or eat their lunches while performing their duties. We owe them a lot. And although you are not going to see a lot of documentaries about the correctional officer in the TV shows, they work just as hard as any patrolman on the street. And they are outnumbered and surrounded by their  adversaries every day. Their role is critical and yet goes unrecognized often. We can do our part to recognize them this week. Hopefully, this bill will bring some much deserved appreciation for their work, and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to a strong supporter of programs to give prisoners incentives to better themselves and a strong supporter of correctional officers, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis).</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Mr. DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="264">H. Res. 264</bill>, the Congressional Lawmaking Authority Protection Act of 2007 and the National Correctional Officers and Employees Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Correctional officers are the largest part of the workforce in jails and prisons, and they enforce the regulations governing the operation of correctional institutions as both supervisors and counselors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While they have no law enforcement responsibilities outside the institution where they work, each day they put themselves in harm's way, maintaining security and inmate accountability to prevent disturbances, assaults, and escapes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By definition, working in a correctional institution can be stressful and hazardous. Between 1990 and 1995, the number of attacks on correctional officers in State and Federal prisons jumped by nearly one-third, from 10,731 to 14,165, at a time when the number of correctional officers increased by only 14 percent. Except for police officers, the number of workplace nonfatal violent incidents is higher per 1,000 employees for correctional officers than any other profession. From 1992 to 1996,  there were nearly 218 incidents for every 1,000 correctional officers, for a total of 58,300.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Correctional officers' roles in our society are and continue to be critical. We must continue to recognize the sacrifices they and their families make on a daily basis to ensure the safety and well-being of the prison population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I spend a fair amount of time in and around correctional institutions. As a matter of fact, I serve as a member of the local school council at the Consuelo York Alternative High School in Chicago, which is located in the Cook County Jail. Therefore, whenever I'm there, when we have our regular meetings, I attend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also go to jails sometimes to put up bail for individuals that I know, Representative Scott, who have been arrested. Quite frequently, I speak at jails, correctional facilities and prisons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I simply wanted to take this time to thank all of those individuals who not only work in these stressful situations, but the many men and women with whom I come into contact as they facilitate my entree, and as they assist whatever it is that I've been trying to do and that I try to do while I'm there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I simply say, thank you to all of those corrections officers with whom I come into contact on an annual basis, and urge passage of this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="264">H. Res. 264</bill>, which puts this House on record in support of the goals and ideals of "National Correctional Officers and Employees Week" and which honors the service of correctional officers and employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Correctional facilities form a crucial component of our criminal justce system, and the proper functioning of these facilities is depndent upon the exemplary service performed by correctional peronnel. These men and women work daily in a complex, ever-changing, and often dangerous environment, protecting the rights of the public and safeguarding us, as a Nation, from criminal activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only are these correctional officers and employees responsible for the custody of inmates, but they are also charged with the care of these individuals, and with maintaining their dignity as human beings. This is a profession that exerts immense physical and emotional demands on a daily basis, and requires constant courage and vigilance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, correctional work has become an increasingly sophisticated profession, and we as a nation should take pride in the caliber of those who work in this field. These men and women face overwhelming obstacles, and operate daily in a high-risk environment, yet they receive little recognition. This week, which we observe as National Correctional Officers and Employees Week, is our opportunity to honor all correctional officers and employees for their service to their communities and our  Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="264">H. Res. 264</bill>, to express support for the goals and ideals of National Correctional Officers and Employees Week--May 6th through 12th. This resolution recognizes the important and under-appreciated dedicated service of the correctional officers and employees who staff prisons across this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just this morning, I was at the Fairton Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey, with Warden Paul Schultz, to honor the hard work and highest standards of the men and women serving as correctional officers and employees. I had the great pleasure to present awards to these brave individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a co-chair of the Correctional Officers Caucus, I was pleased to introduce this resolution with Representative Holden, and I am very proud of the correctional officers that it honors. I urge all Members to support this resolution.</paragraph>
