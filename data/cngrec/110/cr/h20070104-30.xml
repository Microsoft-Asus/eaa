    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during the great World War II, the U.S. aircraft carrier Monterey faced its fiercest naval battle, not with the Imperial Japanese Navy, but the storm of the sea, Typhoon Cobra.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A naval lieutenant (jg) answering the call to action motivated the crew to combat against the Cobra's bone-crushing waves, torrential rains, and consuming fires it caused on board the ship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Refusing the order to abandon the ship, this warrior valiantly went below, marching into the mouth of the fire, rescuing those trapped within its grasp. He ignored the searing heat of the flames and the blackness of the smoke. Hour upon hour this man led others in the charge to extinguish the demon fire, saving fellow sailors and officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He did not seek recognition in the darkness of 1944; it sought him. When it called, this naval officer answered in a manner of all American patriots, with courage, valor, and victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty-nine years later, this same individual helped rescue an entire Nation from the fire of corruption and war. And he brought peace. His name was President Gerald Ford, and we thank him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
