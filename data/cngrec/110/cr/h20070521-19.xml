    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I'm pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="1722">H.R. 1722</bill>, which names the postal facility in Boca Raton, Florida, after Leonard W. Herman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1722">H.R. 1722</bill>, which was introduced by Representative Robert Wexler on March 27, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1, 2007, by a voice vote. This measure, which has been cosponsored by 24 Members, has the support of the entire Florida congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Leonard Herman was a bombardier in the United States Army, and he flew numerous missions over Germany during World War II. He displayed heroic actions and earned high honors and several distinguished medals for his bravery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps one of Mr. Herman's greatest achievements was his contribution in seeking to save the lives of thousands of "survivors" of German concentration camps who were dying because of the lack of adequate food, clothing and medical supplies. According to accounts by Professor Robert L. Hilliard, "Leonard Herman took it upon himself to advise and seek help from many of our government leaders regarding the plight of the survivors. His efforts were instrumental in President Truman's learning  about displaced persons' situations in the U.S.-occupied Germany. The President changed U.S. policy and issued orders to provide the assistance and materials needed by the Holocaust survivors. Lieutenant Herman played an important role in saving thousands of these lives."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Robert Wexler from Florida, for introducing this legislation, and I urge swift passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an honor for me to speak today about a true American hero who epitomized bravery and loyalty to his country. Leonard Herman was a decorated World War II veteran who helped save the lives of his fellow servicemen, as well as thousands of civilian victims of the war. He was also instrumental in bringing appropriate attention to President Truman regarding the needs of Holocaust survivors and other displaced persons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leonard Herman served as a bombardier with the U.S. Army and flew in countless combat missions over Germany. Honoring his country, he proudly completed two tours of duty. Among his awards are the Purple Heart, the Air Medal, three Oak Leaf Clusters, and the Distinguished Flying Cross. Fighting against heavy enemy fire, his valiant skills as a bombardier directly saved the lives of his fellow crewmen on repeated occasions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the war he saw firsthand the plight of his fellow Jews, the Holocaust survivors, and urgently began a letter-writing campaign to senior U.S. Government officials, as well as to President Truman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through his determination, U.S. policies towards these victims and other displaced persons were enacted so as to provide the food, shelter and clothing they desperately needed to begin new lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we honor Leonard Herman for his great service to his country and his humanitarian achievements by naming this post office for him.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a distinguished and decorated Jewish war veteran, Mr. Leonard Herman, by naming the postal facility at 601 Banyan Trail in Boca Raton, Florida, as the Leonard W. Herman Post Office. Mr. Herman signed up for two tours of duty during World War II, serving as First Lieutenant from December 12, 1942 through January 29, 1946. His courage during the war and the tenacity with which he fought, after the war, to change U.S. policy towards the survivors and displaced  persons of concentration camps makes him a real American hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a bombardier in the United States Army, Leonard Herman flew numerous combat missions over Germany and committed numerous acts of bravery that helped save countless lives. On October 8, 1943, he shot down an enemy fighter aircraft as it closed in on his plane. This courageous act saved his crewmen and earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross Award. In addition, the heroism he displayed during his tour won him several high honors, including an Air Medal, three Oak Leaf Clusters and the Purple  Heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps one of Mr. Herman's greatest achievements was his contribution to the efforts of a few young soldiers, including his brother Edward Herman, who sought to save the lives of thousands of "survivors" of German concentration camps who continued to die because of the lack of adequate food, clothing and medical supplies. According to the accounts of Professor Robert L. Hilliard, "Lt. Leonard Herman took it upon himself to advise and seek the help from many of our government leaders regarding  the plight of the survivors. His efforts were instrumental in President Truman's learning about the Displaced Persons situation in U.S. occupied Germany. The President changed U.S. policy and issued orders to provide the assistance and material needed by the Holocaust survivors. Lt. Herman played an important role in saving thousands of their lives."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my greatest honor to sponsor this legislation that will recognize Mr. Leonard Herman for his bravery and service to this country. The Post Office designation is a fitting and long overdue tribute. I urge Members of the Committee to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
