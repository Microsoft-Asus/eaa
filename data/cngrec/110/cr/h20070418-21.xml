  <speaking speaker="412231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Democrats in Congress have heard the call for change delivered by the American people last November. In just 3 months, we restored the necessary oversight of the administration and reformed the ethics rules of the House to lessen the influence of lobbyists and add transparency to the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We answered the call for change in direction in Iraq and kept our promise to our Nation's veterans by voting to increase VA health care funding by $11 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We passed meaningful legislation that will help middle class families, lowering the cost of student loans and prescription drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And although we won't be able to dig ourselves out overnight from the mountains of debt Congress and the administration built up over the past 6 years, the new Democratic Congress passed a budget that achieves balance in 5 years without raising a penny of taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, Mr. Speaker, we have listened to the American people and changed the way Congress does business.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
