    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the U.S. has been calling for prompt action at the U.N. Security Council to address the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Burma. Unfortunately, other member nations have been slow to take up the call. One European nation even suggested recently that the world should wait for the situation in Burma to become urgent and acute before we take action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Burma reportedly has close to a million IDPs, internally displaced people. Isn't that urgent? Over 3,000 villages have been brutally destroyed by the military dictatorship. Isn't that an acute situation? The latest story out of Burma tells of four teenage girls brutally raped and then thrown into prison by the military rulers, more evidence of their systematic sexual violence there. Isn't that an urgent problem?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there has been enough talk and enough delay. It is time for the world to take action and end the humanitarian crisis in Burma.</paragraph>
