    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 70th anniversary of historic Summit Road, a significant highway which remains in use to this day as a popular tourist attraction and historic site within the State of Nebraska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was Sunday, September 19, 1937, that the Summit Road leading to the top of Scotts Bluff National Monument in the Nebraska Panhandle was completed. The Summit Road is believed to be the oldest existing concrete road in the State of Nebraska. The road allows visitors to drive to the top of the bluff through three tunnels for a spectacular view of the valley 800 feet below.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Summit Road was built entirely by the Civilian Conservation Corps, CCC, at a time when dry winds and dust storms were blowing across the western High Plains. The CCC was created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt when the entire country was in the grip of the Great Depression to employ jobless men who were struggling to earn enough money to buy food for their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Scotts Bluff National Monument is named for a fur trapper by the name of Hiram Scott, who was wounded and deserted by his companions in 1828. He gained immortality by making his way to a magnificent formation of bluffs along the North Platte River before succumbing to his wounds. It was for Hiram Scott that Scotts Bluff National Monument, Scotts Bluff County, and the city of Scottsbluff have been named.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Scotts Bluff National Monument, which rises 4,649 feet above sea level, was an imposing landmark, guiding wagon trains along the Oregon, Mormon, California, and Pony Express Trails. Native Americans originally called this natural formation Ma-a-pa-te, which translates into "hill that is hard to go around."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Scotts Bluff National Monument is home to an excellent museum providing information about the historic pioneer trails, together with an impressive collection of art from William Henry Jackson, a photographer and painter, best known as the first person to photograph the wonders of Yellowstone National Park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was reported that 550 cars drove to the top of Scotts Bluff National Monument when the Summit Road was opened 70 years ago. Since then, thousands of vehicles have made the trip and are still able to do so today, thanks to the efforts of the CCC which built it and the National Park Service which now maintains the road.</paragraph>
