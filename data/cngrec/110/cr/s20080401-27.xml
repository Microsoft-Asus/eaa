  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the 10th anniversary of the Bay Area Green Business Program in Contra Costa County, the Contra Costa Green Business Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded in 1998, the Contra Costa Green Business Program was one of the first green business programs to be established in the nine-county Bay area region. Composed of a partnership between local, regional, State, and Federal Government agencies and utilities, the Bay Area's Green Business Programs help local businesses throughout the Bay area proactively conserve resources, prevent pollution, and minimize waste.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Californians have always led the way in fighting for a clean environment. I applaud the Contra Costa Green Business Program for strengthening and sustaining the quality of the environment in the county through a collaborative partnership of public and private organizations that encourages, enables, and recognizes businesses taking action to prevent pollution and conserve resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Breaking with the tradition of environmental initiatives targeting big businesses, the Contra Costa Green Business Program offers small- to medium-sized businesses a complete environmental guide, scaled to their operations, for conserving energy and water, reducing waste, preventing pollution, and complying with environmental regulations. It also certifies and recognizes businesses of all types for meeting these rigorous environmental standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Contra Costa Green Business Program has certified over 300 businesses throughout the county in the last 10 years. I commend the program's dedicated staff and volunteers who work diligently to show local businesses how they can be both green and profitable at the same time. By recommending a wide range of measures that help lessen greenhouse gas emissions and conserve resources, the Contra Costa Green Business Program is helping smaller businesses protect the climate in very meaningful ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the Contra Costa Green Business Program for its dedicated work on this special occasion, and I send my best wishes for many future successes over the next 10 years.</paragraph>
