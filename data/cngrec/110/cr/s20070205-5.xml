    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 4 p.m. today. During morning business, Senator Byrd is to be recognized for up to 60 minutes. At 4 p.m. we will resume debate on the motion to proceed to <bill type="s" number="470">S. 470</bill>, the sense-of-Congress language relating to Iraq. Last Thursday I moved to proceed to that bill and filed a cloture motion. That vote is slated to occur today at 5:30.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now ask unanimous consent that the time from 4 to 5:20 be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees, and the final 10 minutes prior to 5:30 p.m. be equally divided between the two leaders, with the majority leader controlling the last 5 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
