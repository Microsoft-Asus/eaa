  <speaking speaker="400384" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate America Ferrera for winning the Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy for her work in ABC's television show "Ugly Betty." America Ferrera is a native of Los Angeles, the daughter of Honduran immigrant parents and a student at the University of Southern California, earning a degree in international relations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Betty Suarez, her character in "Ugly Betty," Ferrera plays a smart, young Latina professional breaking into the publishing world. The people we see in here on television and in movies have a great influence on our communities and the attitudes of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While 40 percent of American youth ages 19 and under are children of color, few of the faces that they see on television actually reflect those races and cultures. Through her work, Ms. Ferrera is breaking down barriers for Latinos and Latinas in prime-time television.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend America Ferrera and everyone involved in Ugly Betty for helping to break down the stereotypes and provide a role model for young Latinas. I hope we can work together to teach everyone to appreciate diversity in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations, America Ferrera.</paragraph>
