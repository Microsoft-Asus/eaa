  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Finance Committee is meeting tomorrow at 2:30. Senator Baucus and his respective Democratic and Republican members are going to attempt to come up with a bipartisan stimulus package. I hope that can be done. That being the case, what we would do is go to the House bill. We would attempt to amend that with the matter that would come from the Finance Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will work very hard with my Republican colleague and all the Democrats and Republicans to try to come up with a procedure whereby we would have an extremely limited number of amendments on both sides so we can complete this legislation as rapidly as we can.</paragraph>
