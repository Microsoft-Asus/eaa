    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I'm pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="2825">H.R. 2825</bill>, which names the postal facility in Princeton, Illinois after Owen Lovejoy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2825">H.R. 2825</bill>, which was introduced by Representative Jerry Weller on June 21, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on July 19, 2007, by a voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire Illinois congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Owen Lovejoy, the son of a Congregational minister, was born on January 16, 1811, in Albion, Maine. He graduated from Bowdoin College, Brunswick, in 1832 and studied law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1836, Mr. Lovejoy was ordained as the pastor of the Congregational Church in Princeton, Illinois, a position which he held for 17 years. He was a strong opponent of slavery, and he used the pulpit to attack slavery and helped slaves gain their freedom from bondage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1856, Mr. Lovejoy was elected to Congress with the help of fellow Illinoisan, Abraham Lincoln. He served four terms in the United States House of Representatives and continued his work as an abolitionist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Lovejoy worked with Members of Congress in both Chambers to weaken slavery and attempted to achieve a measure of equality for all people regardless of race. When critics within his own Republican Party expressed fears that the former slaves were not going to live in the North if they gained their freedom, Mr. Lovejoy replied, and I quote, "Let them stay where they are and work under the stimulus of cash instead of the lash."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Lovejoy died on March 25, 1864, just 2 weeks before the introduction of the 13th amendment to the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Jerry Weller, for introducing this legislation, and urge swift passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we celebrate Mr. Owen Lovejoy, who was an accomplished lawyer, Congregational Minister, abolitionist and Republican Congressman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Lovejoy was born on January 6, 1811, in Maine, where he taught school in order to support himself while in college and law school after his father's death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After becoming a convert to abolitionism in 1836, he studied for the ministry under his brother, Elijah Lovejoy, a well known antislavery, Presbyterian minister. Tragically, 1 year later, Elijah was murdered while trying to prevent the destruction of the printing press of an Illinois antislavery society from an angry, drunken anti-abolition mob. After his brother's murder, Mr. Lovejoy is reported to have vowed to devote himself to, quote, "the cause that has been sprinkled with my brother's  blood."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After becoming a Congregational church minister, Lovejoy used the pulpit to attack slavery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was elected to Congress in 1856, with the support of Abraham Lincoln, and served four terms. Although he died before seeing the enactment of the 13th amendment to the Constitution, Congressman Lovejoy's legacy lives as a lifelong champion of equality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of his courageous support of equality for all, regardless of race, it is fitting that we name the Princeton, Illinois Post Office in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve. I have no further speakers, so I will wait for my colleague to yield back, and then I will.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, I have no further speakers, but I, again, want to commend my colleague from Illinois, Representative Jerry Weller, for introducing this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Owen Lovejoy, in actuality, is one of the great abolitionists of his day, an individual that many people don't know nearly enough about. And so I commend Representative Weller for making sure that he will be etched in the hearts and minds of the people in that town and in that community. I urge its passage.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400429" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="2825">H.R. 2825</bill>, a bill I introduced that would name the post office in Princeton, Illinois after Owen Lovejoy. Owen Lovejoy is perhaps best known for his role in advocating for the abolition of slavery and his work with the Underground Railroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Owen Lovejoy was born in Albion, Maine in 1811 to Daniel, a Presbyterian minister, and Elizabeth Lovejoy. While growing up, young Owen came to admire his older brother Elijah, who taught him Latin classics when Elijah came home from college. Owen grew up to follow in his brother's footsteps by attending Bowdoin College. Unfortunately, his father died while Owen was in school, forcing him to leave Bowdoin College after 3 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the death of his father, Owen moved to Illinois to live with his brother Elijah, who was the editor of an anti-slavery newspaper. During this time, Owen became a convert to abolitionism. His dedication to abolitionism grew on November 7, 1937 when an anti-abolition mob attempted to destroy Elijah's printing press. In the ensuing struggle, Elijah Lovejoy was killed by the mob. For Owen, abolitionism became "the cause that has been sprinkled with my brother's blood."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After his brother's death, Owen Lovejoy moved to Princeton, a village with a population of 200. Rev. Edward Beecher recommended him to Hampshire Colony Congregational Church, the church from which he spoke out against slavery for the next 17 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Owen used the pulpit to attack slavery. He also operated the "Lovejoy Line" of the Underground Railroad. His farmhouse, surrounded by 1300 acres of farmland, was one of the busiest for slaves trying to gain their freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1854, Owen Lovejoy was elected to the Illinois legislature. Two years later, he was elected to Congress with the help of a fellow Illinoisan, Abraham Lincoln. He served four terms as the Representative to Illinois' Third  Congressional District. As a Congressman, Owen continued to work towards the abolition of slavery. Owen worked with members in both chambers in creating legislation to weaken slavery and achieve equality for all people, regardless  of race.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1863, Owen introduced the legislative version of the Emancipation Proclamation. Sadly, he did not get the chance to see his legislation become law. On March 25, 1864, Owen Lovejoy died of Bright's disease, 2 weeks before the introduction of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. When President Lincoln heard of Lovejoy's death, he wrote,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It can be truly said of him that while he was personally ambitious he bravely endured the obscurity which the unpopularity of his principles imposed . . . To the day of his death, it would scarcely wrong any other to say, he was my most generous friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring Owen Lovejoy for his work and determination towards abolishing slavery in America by supporting <bill type="h" number="2825">H.R. 2825</bill>.</paragraph>
