  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased today to honor a community in North Dakota that is celebrating its 100th anniversary. On July 6-8, the residents of Lignite will celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lignite is a vibrant community located in northwestern North Dakota. It was founded in April 1907 as a coal town. The first post office followed within the same month. Today the name Lignite pays tribute to the coal veins located in and around the town. Lignite is also the first town in North Dakota to drill an oil well within the city limits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Lignite remains a small but thriving town with a strong sense of community. Many different local organizations are proud to call Lignite home. These include local chapters of 4-H, FFA, American Legion, and the Boy and Girl Scouts of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are also many recreational opportunities for the citizens of Lignite, from quilting to hunting, camping to golf, softball to ice fishing. The town also boasts a large public park for residents and campers alike. For its centennial celebration, Lignite has planned a four-day-long festival that includes softball and golf tournaments, a day-long street festival, and a local fashion show.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Lignite, ND, and its residents on their first 100 years and in wishing them well in the next century. By honoring Lignite and all the other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great tradition of the pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Lignite that have helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lignite has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
