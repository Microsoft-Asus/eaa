  <speaking speaker="412227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today the House begins debate on the Defense authorization bill, a bill that was passed out of the Armed Services Committee 58-0, unanimously. The legislation received the support of the entire committee because it focuses on our Nation's immediate threats and the benefits our soldiers need today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Defense bill authorizes substantial resources to improve the protection of our troops, including $4 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles. These vehicles have been shown to dramatically reduce the injuries of our soldiers. We want to ensure that our troops have access to the best equipment that will protect them while they are in battle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his budget earlier this year, the President proposed giving our troops a 3 percent pay raise. This Congress believes they deserve more, and consequently they will receive a 3.5 percent raise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this Defense bill shows our dedication to the troops on the front lines, and it deserves strong bipartisan support.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
