    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is a privilege to be able to offer my most sincere congratulations to the State of Israel as it celebrates its 60th anniversary of independence. I am so proud that Israel has not only survived, but has become one of the most prosperous and successful democracies anywhere in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Israeli National Anthem, Hatikvah, means, "The Hope." That is really what the modern State of Israel has been about over these 60 years. Founded after the horrors of the Holocaust, the Jewish people created a place where their faith and history could be secured and passed from generation to generation. In this place, never again would dictators or fanatics be able to systematically persecute, terrorize, and murder entire communities or an entire people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hope sustained the Jewish people through 3,000 years of persecution that culminated in the evils of the Holocaust. And for the last 60 years, that same sense of hope for the future has allowed the people of Israel to persevere in the face of continual assaults on its very existence, whether they are in the form of war, terrorism, or assassination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Israel celebrates this milestone, I am proud to say that the United States has been by its side, offering support and assistance, and watching it grow  into an unparalleled partner in promoting the ideals of democracy, personal freedom, and human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States has also tirelessly supported Israel as it continues to seek lasting peaceful coexistence with its neighbors to bring a permanent end to years of suffering and senseless violence. And we will continue to be there to support them in that effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Yitzhak Rabin went before the Knesset in October 1995 to discuss the ratification of the Israeli-Palestinian interim agreement, he said the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Here, in the land of Israel, we returned and built a nation. Here, in the land of Israel, we established a state. The land of the prophets, which bequeathed to the world the values of morality, law and justice, was, after two thousand years, restored to its lawful owners--the members of the Jewish people. On its land, we have built an exceptional national home and state."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Israel is indeed an exceptional nation state, and this milestone is a great testament to the hope, faith, and perseverance of the Jewish people. I offer my congratulations to Israel on the 60th anniversary of its founding.</paragraph>
