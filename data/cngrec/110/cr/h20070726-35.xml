  <speaking speaker="400065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have stood here for the better part of an hour as we debated this rule, and I frankly cannot believe what I am hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It sounds to me like the Republican caucus of this body is actually considering voting against the thousands of farmers, their families, and the millions of people throughout this country that rely on farming for their livelihood in favor of a few wealthy international companies who are deliberately evading U.S. tax law and big oil companies that have been gouging Americans at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth is that the Ways and Means Committee has taken the advice of the Bush administration and closed a loophole for tax cheats in order to pay for lifesaving nutrition programs for millions of Americans. This energy offset comes from reducing taxpayer subsidies for multinational oil and gas companies that have enjoyed a free ride from this Congress for far too long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The price of oil today in New York was $75 a barrel. Is that not enough for Americans to pay? So enough with this song and dance. This is about closing loopholes for tax cheats, a loophole that your Republican administration has been advocating. This is closing a loophole for tax cheats, a loophole that this administration has been advocating being closed for years, as it is reducing windfall profits for Big Oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to make the right choice here and stop playing politics with the American public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We used to have a $30 billion trade surplus in agriculture. Like everything else, we are trading that away. If we aren't careful, we are going to become an importer of agricultural goods for the first time in the history of the United States. That won't happen on our watch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's bad enough that countries like China, Japan, and Saudi Arabia are our bankers. Let us not make them our farmers, too. That is not the way this country was built, and I assure you this new Democratic Congress will not abandon our farm community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a once-in-a-lifetime bill that will meet our country's needs. Every major group, the commodities, the specialty crops, the nutrition groups, the conservationists and others support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A "yes" vote on this rule and the underlying bill is a vote for the hungry, a vote for the environment, a vote for energy independence, but, most importantly, a vote to deliver on our long-standing commitment to rural America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge a "yes" vote on the rule and on the previous question.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400123" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule. The rule waives all points of order on the underlying bill to shield the Democratic Leadership's attempt to bypass the rules of the House and the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means. Clause 5(a) of Rule 21 states that, "a bill or joint resolution carrying a tax or tariff measure may not be reported by a committee not having jurisdiction to report tax or tariff measures."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, the bill before us today was not reported by such a committee, only by the Committee on Agriculture. Specifically, Section 1303 of the bill would change the administration of U.S. tariff rate quotas for imports of sugar so that the tariff rate quotas no longer apply on a yearly basis, but rather on a semi- annual or even quarterly basis for certain imports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this provision, importers who wish to import sugar into the United States outside of the narrow time period specified in the bill would be required to pay the over-quota tariff rate rather than the in-quota tariff rate to which they would otherwise be entitled. Thus, this provision would increase the tariff rate on these imports from 1.46 cents per kilogram to 33.87 cents per kilogram: an increase in the tariff rate of over 2,000 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In effect, this bill changes the tariff classification of these imports because it changes the tariff to which these imports are subject based on when they are imported into the United States. As a result, this language would affect the amount of tariff revenue collected, thus triggering clause 5(a) of rule 21.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Completely egregious in its own right on the merits, the inclusion of this provision also flies smack in the face of the rules of the House and should not be included in the bill today. But, sadly today we are precluded from raising a point of order against this provision as a result of this rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker the rule also contains a self-executing tax increase that will put the squeeze on investment in the U.S. and cost America jobs. Also not considered by the Committee on Ways and Means, this provision, masquerading as a way to keep jobs here, will in fact send jobs overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The practical effect of this amendment is that employers like BASF in Evans City, Pennsylvania will be at a direct disadvantage simply because they have chosen to locate a manufacturing plant in the U.S.--and employ U.S. workers--but have a parent company based in Germany. Similarly, companies throughout my district would be indirectly affected as a result of some of their customers--companies like Honda and Sony among others--being disadvantaged by this provision. In addition, this provision  completely disregards obligations made under international tax treaties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, American workers deserve better, American employers deserve better, and our treaty partners deserve better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge a "no" vote on this most misguided rule.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The previous question was ordered.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the resolution.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The yeas and nays were ordered.</narrative>
  <narrative>Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15-minute vote on adoption of House Resolution 574 will be followed by a 5-minute vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal, if ordered.</narrative>
  <narrative>The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 222, nays 202, not voting 8, as follows:</narrative>
