  <narrative>SENATORS WARNER AND KENNEDY -- (Senate - September 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11003">S11003</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we did, indeed, with the announcement by Senator Warner of his retirement at the end of this term, begin to confront the reality of the Senate without John Warner. I will have a good deal more to say about his career in the coming months. Of course, we will have ample opportunity to celebrate his remarkable service in the Senate because, fortunately, he will be here until January of 2009, continuing to perform his extraordinary service  on behalf of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He indicated to me Friday when we were talking that he had added up the total amount of his time in public service, and it was something like 45 years--truly a remarkable patriot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, later this afternoon Senator Kennedy will cast his 15,000th vote--another giant in this body who should be recognized for his extraordinary accomplishments. He came to the Senate at age 30. He has been here quite a while and made an enormous contribution to our country. We congratulate him on achieving this milestone.</paragraph>
