  <narrative>UNJUST PROSECUTION AND IMPRISONMENT OF U.S. BORDER PATROL AGENTS COMPEAN AND RAMOS -- (House of Representatives - April 14, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2247]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today is day 453 of a terrible injustice in America. Two U.S. border agents, Agents Compean and Ramos, have been languishing in Federal prison since January 17 of 2007.  These men did their job to protect our Nation from an illegal alien, a Mexican drug smuggler who brought $1 million worth of marijuana across our border into Texas. Yet through a questionable prosecution, these two men were convicted for defending  themselves and defending our border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a sad day that such a travesty of justice could happen to two Hispanic Americans who loved America so much that they were willing to become law enforcement officers, and in this case Border Patrol agents, in order to protect America. Despite the efforts of the American people and Members of Congress, who have brought this to the attention of the White House, nothing, and I say nothing, has been done to reverse this injustice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While outside groups and Members of Congress have filed court briefs to support these agents, we still anxiously await a decision in their appeal. The more time these men spend in prison and the longer it takes for a decision on their appeal, the more frustrated the American people become.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people have not forgotten agents Ramos and Compean. From time to time, I still hear from constituents who are frustrated that these men are still in prison. The only glimmer of hope for these agents and their families rests with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. During an oral argument on December 3, 2007, one of the judges considering the case, Judge E. Grady Jolly said, and I quote, Madam Speaker, and this is his quote, "It does seem to me that the government  overreacted here. For some reason, this one got out of hand." That is a Federal judge that made that comment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A ruling on their appeal is now expected any day, and millions of Americans are hopeful that the Court of Appeals will reverse this terrible injustice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I still call on Chairman John Conyers to hold a hearing to review this unjust prosecution some time before the end of the year. Chairman Conyers is a fair-minded person for whom I have great respect. Justice is crying out for his help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And Madam Speaker, before I close, I want the Ramos and Compean family to know that there are those in both parties in this House of Representatives that are not going to sit back and wait until this injustice is corrected because these two border agents deserve nothing but praise for what they have done for this great Nation.</paragraph>
