  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Finance Committee on a bipartisan basis has worked up what they feel is something they are going to bring before the full committee tomorrow, and that will take place--we will get their take on the stimulus package tomorrow. We have all seen the press today. Everyone knows the Senate is going to put their mark on the stimulus package. We feel what will be done will be very stimulative to the economy. It includes, as I understand it, some 20 million seniors who were  left out of what has taken place in the House. There will be unemployment benefits. A number of States are in very difficult shape in that regard. They have some other things dealing with the business package, and I am told that advocacy groups like very much what is in the Senate package. But we will work through this and try to get something done very quickly so that, if there are changes made, we can do a very quick conference and get it to the President. That is an important issue.</paragraph>
