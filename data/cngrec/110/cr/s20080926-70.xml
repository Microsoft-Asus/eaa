  <narrative>IMPROVING ACCESS TO MAINSTREAM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONAL ACT -- (Senate - September 26, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9638">S9638</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, too many Americans are left out of our mainstream financial institutions. Millions of working families do not have a bank or credit union account. The unbanked rely on alternative financial service providers to obtain cash from checks, pay bills, and send remittances. Many of the unbanked are low-and moderate-income families that can ill afford having their earnings diminished by reliance on these high-cost and often predatory financial services. In addition, the unbanked  are unable to save securely to prepare for the loss of a job, a family illness, a down payment on a first home, or education expenses. There are few affordable alternatives for consumers who need small loans quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to enact <bill type="s" number="3410">S. 3410</bill>, the Improving Access to Mainstream Financial Institutions Act of 2008. This legislation authorizes grants intended to help low- and moderate-income unbanked individuals establish credit union or bank accounts. The legislation also authorizes a grant program to encourage the development of affordable small loans at banks and credit unions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a letter of support from the Credit Union National Association, CUNA, for <bill type="s" number="3410">S. 3410</bill> printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>August 1, 2008. </narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR AKAKA: On behalf of the Credit Union National Association (CUNA), I am writing in regards to <bill type="s" number="3410">S. 3410</bill>, the "Improving Access to Mainstream Financial Institutions Act of 2008." CUNA is the nation's largest credit union advocacy organization, representing nearly 90 percent of our nation's 8,300 state and federally chartered credit unions, their state credit union leagues, and their more than 90 million credit union members.</narrative>
  <narrative>CUNA applauds your efforts to encourage low and moderate-income individuals to establish account relationships with mainstream financial institutions and to assist financial institution in offering low cost alternatives to payday loans.</narrative>
  <narrative>Promoting thrift is one of the core missions of credit unions. Credit unions throughout the nation are dedicated to developing and offering products that provide consumers affordable payday lending alternatives. Credit unions also strive to improve their members' economic well-being through financial literacy programs and other initiatives. Because the intent of <bill type="s" number="3410">S. 3410</bill> and the mission of credit unions are so well aligned, CUNA looks forward to the opportunity to work with you and your staff  to suggest operational improvements to the bill as it makes its way through the legislative process.</narrative>
  <narrative>On behalf of CUNA, our state leagues, member credit unions and their credit union members, I appreciate the opportunity to share our views on <bill type="s" number="3410">S. 3410</bill>, and we look forward to continuing to work with you on these and other issues important to consumers.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Daniel A. Mica,</narrative>
