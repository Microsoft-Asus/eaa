    <paragraph>Mr. President, the poet Alfred Edward Housman, 1859-1936, wrote in his poem, "A Shropshire Lad," the following verse:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The trees are in bloom. In Washington, the annual cherry blossom festival begins this Saturday, March 31, and runs through April 15. It is always a beautiful sight, whether viewed under warm and sunny skies or as the blossoms fall like rain on a misty morning. It is a lovely celebration of Spring and a welcome complement to Easter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year Easter falls on April 8, when the Senate will not be in session. Each year, of course, Easter falls on a different day, sometimes with many weeks' difference from year to year. Easter is a very moveable feast and has been throughout its long history. The calculation of when to celebrate Easter has varied through the centuries, being settled for just over 1,427 years by the Council of Nicea in 325 A.D. But even today, Easter remains a moveable feast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Roman Emperor Constantine convoked the Council of Nicea in 325 A.D. to resolve a number of important differences between the religious practices across his empire. The council decided that the Easter festival should be celebrated on the first Sunday after the full moon following the vernal equinox, thus eternally linking the return of spring with the resurrection of Christ. If the full moon occurred on a  Sunday and thereby coincided with the Passover  festival, council further decided that Easter would be commemorated on the following Sunday. The council also declared that the calendar date of Easter would be calculated at Alexandria, in Egypt, which was the leading astronomical center of the fourth century world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This attempt to reconcile Easter celebrations proved difficult, however, as fourth century astronomy lacked the knowledge to resolve a discrepancy between the solar and lunar years. As a result, the differences between the true astronomical year and the Julian calendar then in use continued to grow. By 387 A.D., churches in France and Egypt were celebrating Easter on dates 35 days apart. In 465 A.D., the church adopted a reformed calendar that fixed the date of Easter, but churches in what is  now the United Kingdom refused to adopt the changes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII reformed the Julian calendar yet again, resulting in the calendar in use in much of the West today--the Gregorian calendar. This new calendar corrected many of the difficulties in fixing the date of Easter and other important ecclesiastical dates. When Great Britain and Ireland adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752, Easter was celebrated on the same day in the Western part of the Christian world. However, the Eastern churches did not adopt the Gregorian calendar, and  celebrate Easter on different dates. Occasionally, the two churches' calculations coincide, and Easter is celebrated on the same date throughout the world. The last time that happened was in 1963.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of these details are fascinating, at least to a longtime fan of the study of history. I find it thought-provoking to consider how the study of astronomy and the development of calendars has affected our daily lives today, as they have the daily life of so many who have come before us. But does it matter, Mr. President, when we celebrate Easter? In the long run, I think, the celebration of that momentous moment in history is far more important than precision on the day of the week. Few events  in history have had a more profound impact on our lives. You do not have to be a Christian or an adherent of any particular church or faith, to recognize the impact of Christ's life upon world history, regardless of which day of the week or week of the year it took place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Christ's message, brought home by His sacrifice at Easter time and His subsequent resurrection, changed the lives of billions of people over the years. In Matthew 28:5-6, we are told, "The angel said to the women, `Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; He has risen, just as He said.' " That much change is bound to have an effect on everyone else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rise of a new religion and the power and passion of its churches has changed empires, international boundaries, customs, and lifestyles. The Christian religion has grown and spread across the globe, sweeping old religions away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this Sunday, Christians observe Palm Sunday, recalling Christ's triumphant entry into Jerusalem with crosses made of palm leaves like those that were laid across Christ's path to welcome Him. Next Friday, Christians will commemorate Christ's sacrifice on Good Friday, when He took up His crown of thorns and carried His own cross on that long, sad, walk to be crucified. Then on April 8, church bells will ring, and sunrise services will celebrate His resurrection from the dead and His ascension  into heaven with the rising sun. It is a deeply moving and uplifting period, Mr. President, and it does not matter when it happens--only that it did happen. Beautiful, blessed Easter, giving hope to us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish you and yours all the blessings of Easter, with all of its promise of everlasting life spent in the love of the Lord. I close with a poem by Louise Lewin Matthews, called "Easter Morn."</paragraph>
