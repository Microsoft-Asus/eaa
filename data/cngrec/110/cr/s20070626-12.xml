    <paragraph>Madam President, reserving the right to object, on behalf of the Republican leader, I would add an additional unanimous consent request that at a time to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 96, <bill type="s" number="223">S. 223</bill>, under the following limitations: That the committee-reported amendment be agreed to and that the only other amendment in order be a McConnell or his designee amendment, with  1 hour of debate equally divided in the usual form on the bill and 1 hour equally divided on the McConnell amendment, and that following the use or yielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the McConnell amendment, followed by a vote on passage of the bill, as amended, if amended, with no intervening action or debate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, here we go again, doing their best--that is, the Republicans--to stop us from going ahead on ethics and lobbying reform. The suggestion of the distinguished Senator from Utah is reasonable, but it should be a different matter. In fact, once we look at the amendment, we may be willing to accept it. But it is only an effort to divert attention from ethics and lobbying reform, those matters--corporate jets, what lobbyists can do, what they can't do, bundling, what we need  to do with earmarks. It is an effort to divert attention from that. Attention may be diverted for a few minutes this afternoon, but we are going to continue to focus on it. We need to pass this legislation. It is important we do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We, the Democrats, support what the Senator has suggested, basic electronic filing of FEC reports. There is no problem with that. Senator Feinstein moved it through the Rules Committee and has been seeking consent to pass it on the floor unanimously. We have never seen the amendment Senator McConnell wishes to stick on this. Once we have a chance to review it, we will be able, perhaps, to move forward on this consent request. In any event, let's not muddy the waters on the ethics  bill. We want to move forward on that comprehensive bill, the most sweeping reforms in a long time, probably ever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted everyone to know there has been objection made by the minority to going forward on a conference. The conference will be led by Joe Lieberman on our side, a man who is certainly fair to both sides. Why would we not go to conference on this important legislation?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be back. I will be back and hope there will be the revelation to the Republicans that we are going to do everything we can on this legislation. We are going to focus attention on why it is not going to conference. It is not going to conference because the Republicans are stonewalling our ability to do so, coming up with something as diverting as FEC reports being filed electronically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I object to the request of my friend.</paragraph>
