  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Democrat budget being brought to the floor today is not about leadership, it's about passing the buck, billions of them, onto our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Democrat budget will raise taxes by more than $200 billion over the next 5 years. And if these massive tax hikes don't bring in the revenue they want to keep expanding government, they will trigger more tax increases so they can pay for future spending. This is not leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the repeated warnings of every expert, this does nothing to deal with our Social Security and Medicare crisis. This is not leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tax-and-spend season is alive and well here in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we can eliminate the deficit without raising taxes, but it will take setting priorities, making tough decisions to rein in our colossal government spending and working together. That's leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget is forcing the American people to pay for a lack of leadership, and that's wrong. And the American people are watching.</paragraph>
