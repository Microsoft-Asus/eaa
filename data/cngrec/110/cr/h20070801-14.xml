    <paragraph>Good morning, Madam Speaker. You know, it's simple: If America is the greatest country in the world, then all our children should have health care. That's what Democrats believe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we're going to pass the CHAMP Act to provide health insurance to an additional 5 million children here in America, the children of the working poor. Who are the working poor? They're the people, one-half of them women, who work in service industries, who work in retail. They're laborers, they're the self-employed. Their employees don't provide health insurance, and they can't afford it. They barely make ends meet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, with this bill we will move a long way toward the goal of providing universal health insurance for all American children, and I think that's a good idea. Now, during the course of the day you're going to hear lots of arguments, arguments about processing and why this wasn't fair or done in the right way. You will hear arguments about cost. But let me tell you, at the end of the day, that is all just empty rhetoric and rationalizations. Because the fact is, if America is the greatest country  in the world, then all our children should have health insurance. Period.</paragraph>
