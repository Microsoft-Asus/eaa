    <paragraph>Mr. President, my second comment has to do with our Chaplain. I listened with great interest and humility to the prayer he offered this morning. I felt touched by the things he asked on our behalf. They were the kinds of things I need from our Heavenly Father. I was grateful to the Chaplain for his ability to touch on those. I read his biography before it was published. He was gracious enough to give a copy of it to my wife, who has now read it, and I have reread it. We are well  served by having a man of his spirituality and intellectual background and learning as our Chaplain in the Senate.</paragraph>
