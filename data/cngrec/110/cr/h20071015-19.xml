    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today as the sponsor of <bill type="h" number="2089">H.R. 2089</bill> to rename the main post office in New Orleans from the New Orleans Main Office Window Service to the Louisiana Armed Services Veterans Memorial Post Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Chairman Waxman for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor today as well as my colleague Mr. Davis of Illinois, as well as fellow members of the Louisiana congressional delegation who join me as cosponsor of this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we approach the commemoration of Veterans Day, it is important to note that the State of Louisiana has made many contributions to each branch of our armed services and, by extension, to the defense of this Nation. My State of Louisiana is home to many proud armed service veterans dating from World War I to the present military engagement in Iraq. I am proud to say that many of my fellow Louisianans have volunteered and sacrificed as soldiers and as families of soldiers in the defense of this  great Nation, and it is only appropriate that we memorialize them in this significant way. Louisiana is home to well over 370,000 uniformed veterans. This includes nearly 120,000 who served in World War II, 47,000 in the Korean War, 115,000 in the Vietnam War, and 80,000 in Desert Storm, the first Gulf War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, simply citing statistics does not give a complete picture. It doesn't give a complete picture of the sacrifices nor contributions made on behalf of the soldiers nor does it detail the historical relationship of Louisiana and the armed services branches of our Nation. It could be easily argued that the very battle that propelled America onto the world stage as a political and military power was fought on January 8, 1815, just below New Orleans, the Battle of New Orleans. Louisiana military  posts were key supply points for the Mexican War of 1848. The Nation's first African American woman to earn her star as a general in the U.S. Army was Sherian Grace Cadoria, who grew up in Marksville, Louisiana, and graduated from my alma mater at Southern University in Baton Rouge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Louisiana is also home to three major military installations, Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, the Army's Fort Polk Joint Readiness Training Center near Leesville, and in my district, the Belle Chase naval facility across the Mississippi River from New Orleans. Each installation is an integral part of its respective community. Each also employs many local residents and has a profound impact on the economy of our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would be remiss, Madam Speaker, were I not to mention the Louisiana National Guard, which calls New Orleans home at Jackson Barracks. The National Guard has made significant contributions within the State as well as abroad. During the first Gulf War, Louisiana had the highest number of guardsmen serving per capita than any other State in the Nation. However, Louisiana's contributions to the armed services does not come without cost. During the current war in Iraq, Louisiana lost more than 100  of its servicemen and women and over 500 have been wounded; yet this is not the only area in which our armed servicemen and women have paid a high price. Unfortunately, some of our veterans have had to fight two wars, one abroad and then  one back at home. I am very pleased this Congress has recognized that to some great measure and has done much more this year for our veterans than ever before. But in my district, where the Veterans Administration Hospital remains closed, this notion is particularly poignant of two wars. The closure of this</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today, with Veterans Day not far off, we honor and recognize our veterans in Louisiana who have paid a high price for our collective freedom. We do this by memorializing them in this significant way and memorializing their sacrifices forever by renaming the Main Post Office Building in New Orleans the Louisiana Armed Services Veterans Memorial Post Office. I urge passage of this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of <bill type="h" number="2089">H.R. 2089</bill>, to designate the U.S. Postal Service location at 701 Loyola Avenue in New Orleans as the Louisiana Armed Services Veterans Post Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the Battle of New Orleans in the War of 1812, to the Chinese Bandits who laid the groundwork for U.S. air superiority in the Asian theater in World War II, to LTG Russell Honore's leadership of the military response to Hurricane Katrina, Louisianans have been at the forefront of defending this country from the time of its founding to this very day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Louisiana's fighters have always been known for being a little tougher, a little wilder, a little crazier, if you will, than their counterparts from elsewhere. It made them perfect for some missions, but not so perfect for others. But the end result always has been that they have been quick in the Bayou State to take up arms whenever their country needed them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consider Claire Chennault. In 1937, Chennault, a captain in the U.S. Army Air Corps, progenitor of the Air Force, resigned his commission to go to China on behalf of Madam Chaing Kai-shek to help the Chinese build an air force to fend off the Japanese. He did not leave until World War II ended in 1945. In the interim, he helped organize an air force that featured strategically located airfields and an air raid warning system built from scratch that protected all of what was then known as Free  China. Without his work, American air power could not have functioned in China. Later, Chennault was to describe the air raid warning system as a vast spider net of people, radios, telephones, and telegraph lines that covered all of Free China accessible to enemy aircraft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, something out of nothing. The same as the muskets Louisianans used to fend off the British in New Orleans, and General Honore used to help rebuild Louisiana after Katrina. It is a tradition well worth honoring, and this measure does just that.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="2089">H.R. 2089</bill>, which names a postal facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, after the Louisiana armed services veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2089">H.R. 2089</bill> which was introduced by Representative William Jefferson on May 1, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on September 20, 2007, by voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire Louisiana congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Louisiana armed services veterans were recognized for their significant contributions to our country early in the 19th and 20th centuries. During the War of 1812, Louisiana's veteran troops, which included French, Spanish, African, Anglo, Creole, and Native American people, under General Andrew Jackson, decisively defeated the British forces on January 8, 1815. This battle forced the British to recognize the United States' claim to Louisiana and helped establish America as  a political and military power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 20th century, the famous Louisiana maneuvers held at Fort Polk, Louisiana, in 1940 tested the mettle of future World War II Army Generals Dwight D. Eisenhower and George Patton and the soldiers who served under their leadership. President Eisenhower referred to Louisianan Andrew Jackson Higgins as "the man who won the war." In New Orleans, Higgins designed and built amphibious landing craft that made possible the invasions of enemy-held Pacific Islands and the coast of France D-Day invasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rural southeast Louisiana was native soil for two Marine Corps commanders, General John Archer Lejeune and General Robert Barrow. The Nation's first black woman to earn her stars as a U.S. Army General, Sherian Grace Cadoria, grew up in Marksville, Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Louisiana veterans for centuries have served and defended our country with exemplary valor and honor. And so, Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative William Jefferson, for introducing this legislation and urge its passage.</paragraph>
