    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, an analysis of the accomplishments under Democrat control here in Congress for the 110th Congress has shown that not much has been accomplished. Let's take a look at it. There have been a thousand votes taken this year. When you look at those thousand votes, only 106 bills have been signed by the President. What are those bills? Well, 46 were naming of post offices, public buildings and bridges. Not much accomplishment there. And 44 bills were noncontroversial. Some  were actually Republican bills. They had strong bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourteen of these bills were reauthorization of existing law that the Republicans developed and were just continuing. And two substantial, serious bills that passed this House, the FISA bill and the Iraq supplemental, passed without one member of the Democrat leadership supporting it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is all that has been accomplished, and I think the American people need to know. Lastly, not one appropriation bill has been sent to the President and the fiscal year is already over.</paragraph>
