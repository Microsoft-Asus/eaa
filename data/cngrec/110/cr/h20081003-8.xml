    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there is a song "The Day the Music Died." I don't think it is too much of a stretch to say this may be the day America died. I am not alone in feeling that what the Congress is about to do today is a very, very serious, consequential thing for this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to quote from an article from Investor's Business Daily today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"After years of faking it, the Federal Government has finally hit bottom or, depending on how you look at it, ascended to its level of maximum destructive incompetence."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Through its power over education and communications, Washington already influences the creation and dissemination of knowledge. Once it takes over the financial industry, nothing will be left standing in the way of the Federal Government's dominance. States and localities are mere administrative units and disbursing agents for Washington. Government has won its war against religion, sidelining churches."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"American capitalism is not just an economic theory. It is a way of life where rewards are based on achievement, not identity or class, and is therefore inextricably bound up with individual freedom and American exceptionalism."</paragraph>
