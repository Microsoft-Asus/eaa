  <speaking speaker="400051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, over the last 2 years Americans have heard story after story about what my constituents very frequently call, "Members Gone Wild."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Duke Cunningham, James Traficant, Bob Ney, Frank Ballance have all been convicted of crimes and are serving time in prison. These are all former Members of Congress and hail from both sides of the partisan divide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, constituents are fed up with this behavior. They expect their elected representatives to be held to a higher standard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the FBI gets an authorized search warrant and enters the office of a sitting Member accused of taking bribes, it just makes sense to constituents and to me that Congress should not interfere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, I reintroduced my legislation, <bill type="hr" number="88">H. Res. 88</bill>, a resolution that declares to our constituents that we agree with them: Members of Congress should not be above the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Listen up, America. Turning a blind eye to alleged indiscretions by elected Members of Congress will no longer pass muster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join with others who are cosponsoring this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
