    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the fifth anniversary of the Wachovia Championship golf tournament and its contribution to charitable causes in North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several years ago, a group of North Carolinians gathered to begin the planning for this first-class event. Under their leadership, the Wachovia Championship has quickly risen to the top echelon of sporting events in the country. In only 5 short years, the Wachovia Championship has become known as one of the preeminent golf tournaments in the country--second only to the major championships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The organizers desired to create a premier sporting event that would provide a first-class experience for patrons, PGA tour players, and volunteers that at the same time would have a significant economic impact for the Carolinas, showcase our State and region to a national and international television audience, and most importantly, raise significant funds for charitable causes in the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On all accounts, the Wachovia Championship has been a resounding success story. This year alone, the Wachovia Championship will have an economic impact of over $45 million in the state of North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The primary beneficiary of the success of the Wachovia Championship is Teach for America. Funds generated from the tournament are used to support the national efforts of this organization. Teach for America is the national corps of outstanding college graduates who commit 2 years to teach in low-income communities and become advocates for expanding educational opportunity. Since 1990 nearly 17,000 college graduates have joined Teach for America, impacting the lives of over 2.5 million students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In North Carolina, Teach for America has over 250 corps members teaching in Charlotte, Durham and communities across the eastern half of the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the inception of the tournament, over $4 million has been generated for Teach for America from the success of the Wachovia Championship in Charlotte.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you can see, this is much more than just a golf tournament. The Wachovia Championship is a community and economic success story.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the organizers and the thousands of volunteers that make the Wachovia Championship one of the special events that makes our state of North Carolina proud.</paragraph>
