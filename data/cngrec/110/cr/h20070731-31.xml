    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American people are demanding that this Congress take action to responsibly end the war in Iraq and bring our troops home safely. If the results of last November's election were not clear enough, a poll released last week indicates that a majority of Americans look to Congress and not the President to extricate ourselves from this dangerous mess. Day after day we hear about Republicans "questioning" the President's stay-the-course strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But mere words that grab headlines will not guarantee the responsible disengagement of our troops. Congressional action can and will.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this month, the House passed the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act, a plan that would bring our troops home by April of next year. Sadly, the measure received just four Republican votes. Rather than join our efforts, most Republicans continue to block meaningful attempts to end this war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is one thing to raise questions, but actions speak louder than words. This week Republicans get another chance. I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to listen to the American people; take action now and bring our troops home.</paragraph>
