  <speaking speaker="400350" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge a woman who has touched the lives of so many people with her caring, her intelligence, her compassion and her generosity. This woman has been a friend and inspiration to me personally and has affected the lives of so many people here in the Congress, in the First Congressional District which I represent, as well as throughout the country, with her wisdom and her expertise in the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am referring to my deputy chief of staff and legislative director for the past 9 years, Mrs. Yardly Pollas-Kimble. It saddens me to announce that Mrs. Pollas-Kimble will be leaving my office and embarking on a career in the private sector, where I am sure she will continue to be very successful and widely acclaimed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, anyone who has worked on the Hill for any significant amount of time has probably heard of or worked with Mrs. Pollas-Kimble in some capacity. Not only has Mrs. Pollas-Kimble been the glue that has held my office together for so many years, but she is a person that countless other staffers from many offices on both sides of the aisle have come to rely on for information, for direction and for guidance. I don't know of anyone who has been so accessible to so many people, and always  with a smile on her face, as Yardly has been.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Directing my legislative agenda for the past 9 years, Mrs. Pollas-Kimble has been someone that I have come to rely on deeply, and she has guided many legislative initiatives for my office, including the COPE Act, the Family Telephone Connection Protection Act, the Telecommunication Ownership Diversity Act, the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act, and the Payday Borrower Protection Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the way, Madam Speaker, if any of my colleagues would like to sign on as cosponsors to any of these fine pieces of legislation, they can call Yardly today or tomorrow before she leaves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But seriously, Madam Speaker, my office and Congress as a whole will truly be missing a jewel of a person when Mrs. Pollas-Kimble leaves the Hill. Rarely have I worked with a person who so seamlessly embodies the spirit of the American dream, with the perfect combination of ingenuity, creativity, class, compassion and intellect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in New York City, and I won't say what year, Yardly moved with her family to Haiti when she was 8 years old. While in Haiti, Yardly saw both the natural beauty in the people, language and culture, as well as the poverty and destitution that she would later dedicate her life to helping to eradicate, not only in Haiti, but throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduation from high school at the age of 16, which proves that she was a genius, Yardly returned to this country where she graduated from the University of Houston with her Bachelor's degree in politics. Yardly would go on to earn a Master's degree in public accounting and a Juris Doctorate from American University here in Washington, D.C.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After receiving her MPA, Yardly traveled to West and Central Africa, where she spent 2 years monitoring elections in fledgling democracies. While in Africa, Yardly was able to hone her multilingual skills, as today she is a fluent speaker of four languages, including French, Spanish, English and Creole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While attending the University of Houston, Yardly would meet fellow classmates and future husband Kevin Kimble, and the two were married in 1992. Today they have two beautiful children, Anael and Kohl, who are both on the path to education and leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I can't express how much Yardly has meant to my office, where she has been a trusted advisor, a confidant and a friend to me. Yardly has also served as a mentor and a tutor of the legislative process to everyone on my staff who has been a part of our family. Additionally, I cannot count the times I have seen staffers from other offices call or drop by to ask Yardly's opinions on specific legislation or the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I have been truly blessed to have Yardly on my staff for so many years, and I am truly proud to call her a friend. I know she will be successful in future endeavors.</paragraph>
