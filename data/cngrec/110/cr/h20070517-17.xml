  <speaking speaker="412227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day today, this House will send our military a strong message, that we are going to provide them the equipment and the benefits that they so desperately need and deserve as they continue to fight two different wars in Iraq, and certainly in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation, Mr. Speaker, will help protect our troops on the battlefield by providing $4 billion for special vehicles, transportation, that is going to be used in these two wars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when our equipment is being worn out, the legislation also creates a Defense Readiness Production Board that will identify serious readiness issues and will then allow the board to address those issues through funds that are placed in a Strategic Readiness Funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this House, we certainly have differences on how to proceed in Iraq, but we are united in ensuring that our troops are taken care of, both on the battlefield and here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's support this bill today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
