    <paragraph>Mr. President, those of us who hold elected office are accustomed to getting the recognition and praise that comes with a career in public service. However, I think all of us would also recognize that there are many equally dedicated public servants who work behind the scenes and are just as deserving of the public's gratitude and recognition. I rise today to honor one such public servant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In June, Joel Cogen, the executive director and general counsel of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, will retire after 41 years at CCM. Mr. Cogen's retirement marks the end of a highly distinguished career in public service, one in which he became a fixture in Connecticut politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Cogen has been with CCM since its inception in 1966 and has been its executive director since 1968. With Mr. Cogen at the helm, CCM, an organization dedicated to both advocating for the interests of Connecticut municipal governments and promoting efficiency and responsiveness within municipal government, has grown in both size and influence to the point where it is now the dominant voice for Connecticut's cities and towns. In addition to its advocacy work, CCM has also provided its member  municipalities with numerous services, including management assistance, individualized inquiry service, assistance in municipal labor relations, technical assistance and training, policy development, research and analysis, publications, information programs, and service programs such as workers' compensation. These services, provided under Mr. Cogen's leadership, have helped to greatly increase the level of service the people of Connecticut receive from their local officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Mr. Cogen also serves as corporate executive officer of CCM's Connecticut Interlocal Risk Management Agency. This agency allows CCM's member towns to pool their resources to purchase services, such as workers' compensation insurance, that many towns might otherwise find too expensive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before his tenure at CCM, Mr. Cogen held numerous other public service positions. He worked for 9 years at the New Haven Redevelopment Agency, while at the same time working as an assistant for then-mayor Richard C. Lee. Before that, he worked for the Ansonia Redevelopment Agency, the New York State Mediation Board, and the U.S. Wage Stabilization Board. He also brought his skills to the U.S. Army, where, as an officer for 2 years, he handled various management assignments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given all of these accomplishments, I cannot help but think of Mr. Cogen's retirement in bittersweet terms. While I am certainly happy for him and wish him all the best, I cannot help but think about what a loss it will be for Connecticut when he steps down. I am sure, however, that his dedication to the State will live on in all who know him and worked with him and that we will be left in good hands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Joel Cogen. Connecticut is a better place because of you and all you have done.</paragraph>
