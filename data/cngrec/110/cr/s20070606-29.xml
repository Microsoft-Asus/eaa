  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize a tremendous small business from my home State of Maine that was recently designated as the 2007 Eastern Region Small Business of the Year by the United States Chamber of Commerce. Established in 1927 by Frank A. Peabody, the F.A. Peabody Company, based in Houlton, ME, has grown over the last 80 years to meet the insurance, investment, and real estate needs of Mainers. From the number of employees, to the number of locations, and even the services  the company provides to the residents of northern Maine, F.A. Peabody's expansion has been a crowning achievement of small business in Aroostook County and, indeed, all of northern and eastern Maine. This award is a fitting recognition of F.A. Peabody's past accomplishments, and its continued superb work for Maine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>F.A. Peabody began as a property casualty insurance agency for Aroostook County, and grew to represent 20 insurance companies. As time progressed, the company expanded to meet other needs in the community, including investment management, real estate brokerage, and travel services. A truly diversified operation, F.A. Peabody has gone further in recent years by administering mortuary trusts and providing broadband internet to businesses and individuals from the counties of Maine's northern potato  fields to its eastern shoreline. In light of a lack of broadband internet in Aroostook County earlier this decade, F.A. Peabody decided to take action and become a broadband internet service provider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Collectively, F.A. Peabody employs over 70 people, and has a wellness program to award employees with bonuses and gifts. Chris and Bob Anderson, president and chief financial officer, respectively, of F.A. Peabody, carry on the company's commitment to Maine's positive, pro-growth small business community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>F.A. Peabody is truly a success story, and a bright example of what small businesses can accomplish with measured expansion and consistent determination. I congratulate F.A. Peabody on all of its accomplishments and, in particular, for garnering the attention of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. This award is well-deserved, and I am confident that F.A. Peabody's strong, outstanding achievements will continue for years to come as a source of pride for all of Maine. I wish F.A. Peabody and its employees  continued success.</paragraph>
