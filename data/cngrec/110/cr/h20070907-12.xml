  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address an issue that means a great deal to me, the education of homeless youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shortly before the August recess, this House overwhelmingly passed a resolution commemorating the 20th anniversary of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. In addition to recognizing the positive impact of McKinney-Vento, this resolution called on policymakers to unite behind certain common goals for the future. One of those goals is to improve the access of homeless children and youth to education in the public schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to meet this goal, I invite my colleagues to cosponsor a bill that I recently introduced with Representatives SARBANES and GRIJALVA, <bill type="h" number="3205">H.R. 3205</bill>, the Homeless Education Improvement Act of 2007. The bill will extend and improve the successful homeless children and youth programs in NCLB.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, being without a home should not mean being without an education. I strongly encourage my colleagues to cosponsor the Homeless Education Act.</paragraph>
