  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Today, we are likely to wrap up consideration of legislation that modifies the rules governing the FDA, an agency that oversees all of the medical products we use and most of the food we eat. FDA came into being about a century ago because Americans were being sold medicines that caused injury, that caused birth defects, that even caused death; and Americans were consuming food products that too often were not safe. Those kinds of medicines were being sold as cures, but they didn't  cure anything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>FDA's first responsibility--first responsibility--is to safeguard the health of American consumers. But because the products under FDA's authority account for 25 cents out of every dollar U.S. consumers spend, there is a pull on the agency that has nothing to do with patient safety and everything to do with drugs, both brand name and generic, and medical device industry profits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember a few years ago, when I served as ranking member of the Commerce Committee's Health Subcommittee in the House of Representatives, a representative from FDA started his testimony to us in front of that subcommittee by showing us a chart that tracked the U.S. drug industry's global market share.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I told that representative, FDA is not the marketing arm of the drug industry. It is the patient safety arm of the Federal Government, to guarantee safe products for Americans who consume medicine, food, and the like.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But FDA's drug industry dog and pony show is emblematic of the key problem this bill is designed to address. FDA has strayed from its public health mission, and this legislation will help to get us back on track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="1082">S. 1082</bill> requires FDA and drugmakers to work together to assure the safety  of medicines before and after a new drug is approved for marketing. It gives FDA more authority to prevent misleading drug ads and limit patient exposure to drug risks that may still be emerging.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="1082">S. 1082</bill> is intended to realign FDA's actions with its public safety mission. While there are aspects of the bill that I wish were stronger, I believe <bill type="s" number="1082">S. 1082</bill> will improve patient safety and ultimately the bill will save lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Enzi, their staff members, and Ellie Dehoney on my staff, literally worked night and day on this legislation. Other Senators have been there right along with them working to incorporate other key consumer health and safety provisions into this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, this legislation will not only help us prevent drug safety crises, it will help prevent the exploitation of the "citizen petition" process, which delays access to lower priced medicines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prescription drug affordability is a patient safety issue. What medicines cost determines who can afford them and who must forego them. That is a patient safety issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to the hard work of Senators Hatch and Stabenow, among others, this bill also responds to the problem of antibiotic resistance. It takes steps to spur innovation and reduce costs in that market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to the hard work of Senators Dodd, Clinton, and others, this bill will help ensure children receive the right medicine at the right dosage and that they can benefit from medical devices tailored to their special needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="1082">S. 1082</bill> is an important bill, and it will be a better bill if this body passes the Dorgan amendment to enable the safe importation of prescription drugs and rejects Senator Cochran's amendment to prevent safe reimportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consumers are importing prescription drugs today. Seniors in Ohio are taking bus trips to Canada to buy their prescriptions in Windsor. It is happening in border States throughout our country because our country pays the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Government isn't doing anything about that. Too many members of Congress--House and Senate--are, frankly, too involved and too influenced by big drug companies. So American consumers are now taking matters into their own hands. American consumers are importing prescription drugs today. We can help them do it safely or we can turn our backs and simply wish them well. This Senate, and the House, for too many years, along with this President, have turned our backs and wished them well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for something different. Let's help our citizens import prescription drugs safely. Vote for Senator Dorgan's drug safety initiative and vote against Senator Cochran's poison pill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time be charged equally to both sides.</paragraph>
