    <paragraph>Madam President, Friday, May 11, 2007, was National Military Spouses Day. Oftentimes, those who are, as the saying goes, "married to the military" are not recognized for the support they provide and sacrifice they endure during the time of their spouses' active duty service. Certainly when a member is deployed, but throughout a military member's career, the strength and support of a wife or husband can make the difference between success or failure for that individual and that  family. Military spouses endure the hardship of separation from loved ones, frequently take on the role of a single parent, and move more often than most civilians throughout the course of a military career. They receive no commendation medals and few accolades, save the gratitude of an exhausted spouse who comes home to a warm embrace and nurturing bond after a long deployment or simply another late</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the over 1,000 military spouses in or from Idaho and U.S. military spouses worldwide and thank them for their service to our Nation, sacrifice and patriotism. Our country, but most importantly their families, need their strength. We all depend on it.</paragraph>
