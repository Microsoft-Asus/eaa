  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Children's Health Insurance Program is a sound investment. It protects our children. It fosters their development. It helps them thrive. Children without health insurance are children taken to emergency rooms instead of doctors' offices. They are children whose care is delayed and delayed, until simple sickness becomes serious illness. They are children who need our attention, our compassion, our help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has said he opposes this legislation because philosophically he thinks children should be covered by private insurance, not by the Children's Health Insurance Program. It does not matter whether these children in reality should be covered by private insurance. What matters is that these children are not covered by private insurance. Simply, they are not covered at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By lodging a veto threat against this bill, the President is saying that if private insurers have not made room for low-income children, then we should not make room for them either. That is not just faulty logic, it is faulty ethics. At the same time, the President argues that the Children's Health Insurance Program is too expensive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are suggesting--bipartisanly, in both Houses, with a program that started 10 years ago, with a Democratic President, Bill Clinton, a Republican House, a Republican Senate; a bipartisan initiative from 10 years ago--we are suggesting an increase of $7 billion a year over the next 5 years--$35 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Contrast that with the war in Iraq. Mr. President, $7 billion a year, to cover 4 million uninsured children in this country, 75,000 in my State of Ohio--$7 billion a year--contrast that with $2.5 billion a week on the war in Iraq. Mr. President, $7 billion a year; $2.5 billion a week. Yet the President says that is too much to take care of 4 million children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Uninsured children do not have the luxury of time. They cannot will themselves to remain healthy until individual insurance becomes more affordable or employer-sponsored coverage stops eroding or the President becomes more pragmatic. It is up to this body, this week, to take action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Ohio, the Demko family can tell you why they value the Children's Health Insurance Program. Emily Demko, 3 years old, has Down Syndrome. Because of her condition, she is automatically denied private health coverage because Down Syndrome is considered a preexisting condition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Emily was covered by the Children's Health Insurance Program until March 31 of this year. Under the Children's Health Insurance Program, Emily was able to receive the therapy she needed to reach all of her developmental milestones in an age-appropriate way. But in March, Emily was cut off from this program because her father made $113 too much per month for the family to qualify.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her father is self-employed. Her mother stays at home to care for her. Without health insurance, the bills for</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Emily's care total $3,700 per month, which, of course, is impossible for the Demkos to pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Demkos' family income falls within the range of 250 and 300 percent of poverty. Emily has now been without health insurance for 6 months. Governor Strickland and the Republican legislature, bipartisanly, raised the threshold for the Children's Health Insurance Program in Ohio if the Feds go along, if the President signs our bill, to 300 percent of poverty--not for families living in the lap of luxury, but families such as the Demkos who have seen their daughter cut off from her health insurance  because of a preexisting condition and falling out of eligibility because her father makes $100 too much per month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So far, Emily is not regressing, but there is that possibility with Down Syndrome. Her parents cannot afford the insurance for themselves either. But more than anything, they want to see 3-year-old Emily covered. They worry about what will happen to her without the therapy she needs. She does not qualify for any other programs despite her disability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish President Bush would talk to the Demko family, would keep them in mind as he considers whether to sign the Children's Health Insurance Program. I hope he wants to make life better, not harder, for this hard-working family and help Emily to thrive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Children's Health Insurance Program will expire September 30 unless  the President signs this bill. The House and Senate have found a compromise that works for both parties. The version we passed in the Senate passed with 68 votes, more than enough to override a veto. The compromise version is very much like the Senate version, even though some of us would like to see us do a bit more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The compromise would cover 4 million American children, as I said, 75,000 of them living in my State of Ohio. These children did not choose to be uninsured. They are not uninsured because their families walked away from private insurance. Understand, most of the children in the Children's Health Insurance Program are sons and daughters of working parents, parents who are working hard, playing by the rules, simply not making enough money to buy private insurance, and their employers are not providing  that insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, private insurance too often steers clear of too many working families in Akron and Toledo and Zanesville and Marion and Lima and Marietta. These families are uninsured because they have no choice. Their children have no choice. But we have a choice. We can choose to help them. Let's do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. President.</paragraph>
