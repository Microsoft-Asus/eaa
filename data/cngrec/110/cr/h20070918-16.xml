    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in Alan Greenspan's recently released memoir, President Bush and the Republicans in Congress come in for some sharp criticism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reuters said of the book, "Mr. Greenspan sharply criticizes President Bush's administration and Republican congressional leaders in his memoir for putting political imperatives ahead of sound economic policies."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The New York Times said of Mr. Greenspan's book described, "The Bush administration is so captive to its own political operation that it paid little attention to the fiscal discipline for the Nation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increasing America's debt by $3 trillion, the same fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s, the pay-as-you-go rules, led to a $5 trillion surplus when President Bush took office and has led to a $3 trillion debt increase under President Bush and the Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fiscal discipline that we had in the 1990s is exactly what the Democrats have put in place in this new Congress, hoping to put in place the fiscal type of discipline and the budgetary discipline that would lead us again to surpluses and balancing America's book.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And Mr. Greenspan could not have said it better, when people have taken the time to put their political interests ahead of America's long-term economic interests.</paragraph>
