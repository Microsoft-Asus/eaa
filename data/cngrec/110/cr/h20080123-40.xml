  <speaking speaker="400364" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3992">H.R. 3992</bill>, the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 2007. Since the 1960s, State mental health hospitals have increasingly reduced their populations of mentally ill individuals in response to a nationwide call for deinstitutionalization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The move toward deinstitutionalization was based on the fact that mentally ill individuals are constitutionally entitled to refuse treatment, or at least to have it provided in the least restrictive environment. Unfortunately, neither the local governments for the States nor the Federal Government have invested the necessary resources to meet the needs for community-based mental health treatment and services created and needed by deinstitutionalization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A 2006 report by the United States Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics entitled "Mental Health Problems of Prison and Jail Inmates" suggests that the criminal justice system has become, by default, the primary caregiver of the most seriously mentally ill individuals. The bureau reports that over one-half of the prison and jail population of this country is mentally ill. More specifically, 56 percent of State prisoners, 45 percent of Federal prisoners, and 64 percent of jail inmates  have some degree of mental illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill reports that, on any given day, there are at least 284,000 seriously mentally ill people in hospitals and jails in this country, such as people suffering from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or serious depression. However, only 187,000 of them are in mental health facilities. This issue is of particular concern in Virginia, my home State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In August of 2007, the Virginia General Assembly's Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission released a 200-page report on the state of mental health services in Virginia. The report revealed a number of disturbing facts, among them that there are more people with mental illness behind bars in Virginia than there are in mental health facilities, with hospital care accounting for only a fraction of the needs of our State's estimated 400,000 mentally ill individuals in Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since deinstitutionalization in Virginia, the daily number of mentally ill adults in State hospitals has dropped  from 11,532 to 1,452, a drop of 87 percent. Of the 6,350 mentally ill individuals in hospitals and jails on a given day, 60 percent were actually in jails because regional mental health facilities are not providing inpatient mental health services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1991, the number of psychiatric beds available has dropped by 800, or 31 percent, and the beds that are available are concentrated in one area of the State. In fact, there are no freestanding, profitable psychiatric hospitals west of Richmond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These findings in Virginia are similar to those across the Nation that were discussed at a hearing that we held this spring in our subcommittee which revealed that our criminal justice system is serving as the primary caregiver for our mentally ill individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One piece of good news in all of this focus on mental health in the criminal justice system is that mental health courts have proven to be a helpful tool for helping mentally ill individuals in several communities that have such programs. <bill type="h" number="3992">H.R. 3992</bill> will assist further in this regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it will reauthorize the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction grant program, increasing the current authorization from $50 million to $75 million. It will also reauthorize the mental health courts program, and will expand the permissible use of funds to include pretrial services and funding for alternatives to incarceration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, <bill type="h" number="3992">H.R. 3992</bill> creates four new grant programs. One will provide grants to States and other law enforcement agencies to help officers learn how to access individuals with mental health illnesses and to work with the local agencies to provide the most effective placement for a person in custody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another program will provide grants to help correctional agencies learn how to identify and screen mentally ill prisoners so they can get help while incarcerated, or even be placed in alternatives to incarceration. These grants will also help correctional services plan for reentry into the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another program provides grants to States to coordinate and improve the treatment of mentally ill offenders, including facilitating information sharing between agencies. The grant will also encourage States to promote evidence-based practices to improve treatment and services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, a new program will provide States and units of local government to improve the treatment of female offenders with mental illnesses and create family support services and intensive case management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The total cost for the new programs will be $35 million for fiscal years 2008 through 2013. That amount is much less than we are currently spending on incarcerating mentally ill offenders who often have to be placed not only in isolated cells, but also in isolated areas to avoid disturbance of other inmates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite common misconceptions, the majority of mentally ill people who are arrested and incarcerated are low-level, nonviolent offenders. These programs will help jurisdictions to assist mentally ill persons and help keep them from unnecessarily going to jails and prisons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I include for the Record a letter from the Council of State Governments Justice Center in support of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JUSTICE CENTER,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>THE COUNCIL OF STATE GOVERNMENTS,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bethesda, MD, October 24, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CONGRESSMAN SCOTT AND FORBES: On behalf of the Council of State Governments (CSG) Justice Center, we want to thank you for introducing the "Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 2007". We are grateful to you for your leadership and continued support of the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CSG Justice Center serves all states to promote effective data-driven practices--particularly in areas in which the criminal justice system intersects with other systems, such as mental health--to increase public safety and strengthen communities. Consistent with this mission, we have committed for some time to convening and supporting leaders in the criminal justice and mental health systems to improve the criminal justice system's response to people with mental illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the authorization of the Mentally Ill Offender Act, the program has helped states and counties design and implement collaborative efforts between the criminal justice and mental health systems. The grants can be used for a broad range of activities, including mental health courts, mental health and substance abuse treatment for incarcerated mentally ill offenders, community re-entry services, and cross-training of criminal justice, law enforcement, and mental health personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, approximately 16 percent of the adult jail and prison population (350,000 individuals) has a serious mental illness, according to a study by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics. The DOJ also estimates that the prevalence of emotional disturbances among youth in our juvenile justice facilities is even higher. Many of these individuals have not been charged with violent crimes, but rather low level misdemeanors. Treating offenders with mental illnesses in the community  can save money by avoiding the high cost-per-day of jail and prison stays and expensive psychiatric services during incarceration. The Mentally Ill Offender program provides assistance to states and communities to develop new--or expand existing--programs that can both increase public safety and help these individuals return to productive lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are very grateful for your continued leadership on this important issue. We look forward to working with you in support of the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Reauthorization Act. Its enactment is one of our top federal priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael Festa,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Executive Secretary of Elder Affairs, Commonwealth of Massachusetts. &lt;/em&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>THOMAS STICKRATH, </paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I support <bill type="h" number="3992">H.R. 3992</bill>, the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Reauthorization and Improvement Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation addresses the unique challenges that mentally ill offenders create for our criminal justice system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Chairman Conyers, subcommittee Chairman Scott, subcommittee ranking member Gohmert, and the many advocacy groups for their dedication and hard work to address this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, 16 percent of the prison or jail population, or over 1 million prisoners, have a serious mental illness. The Los Angeles County Jail and New York City's Rikers Island Jail house more people with mental illnesses than the largest psychiatric inpatient facilities in the United States. The problem is more than one-fifth of jails have no access to any mental health services at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many criminal justice agencies are unprepared to address the treatment and needs of individuals with mental illness. Jails and prisons require extra staff and treatment resources for inmates with mental illness. In addition, mentally ill offenders can be affected psychologically by incarceration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3992">H.R. 3992</bill> represents an innovative and new approach to the challenge of mentally ill criminal offenders. This legislation is an important step toward treating mentally ill offenders in a humane and appropriate way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3992">H.R. 3992</bill> reauthorizes the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act, which encourages early intervention for individuals with mental illness, reauthorizes the mental health courts program, and maximizes alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent offenders with mental illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation also encourages training on mental health and substance abuse issues, establishes new State and local planning grants to address the needs of mentally ill offenders, and facilitates communication, collaboration, and the delivery of support services among justice professionals, related service providers, and governmental partners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to voice my strong support for the Mentally III Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 2007. This legislation would provide grants for improved  mental health treatment and services provided to offenders with mental illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the course of the past three decades, as our country's mental health infrastructure has deteriorated, many mentally ill individuals have been forced to fend for themselves on the street. Oftentimes, these individuals end up in jail or prison for offenses related to their illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, our jails and prisons have become the sanatoriums of the 21st century. As mental institutions have closed down, jails and prisons have filled up. In fact, prisons currently hold three times more mentally ill people than do psychiatric hospitals, and prisoners have rates of mental illness that can be as high as four times the rate of the general population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not surprisingly, the prison system is ill-equipped to deal with the growing number of prisoners requiring psychiatric care. Jails and prisons do not have adequate resources to properly evaluate incarcerated individuals for mental health and substance abuse problems. Police and other law enforcement officials are generally not trained to handle mentally ill offenders. Mental health services may be provided, but they are often underfunded and inadequate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3992">H.R. 3992</bill>, the "Mentally III Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 2007," addresses this problem by establishing grants for programs training law enforcement officials to better identify prisoners with mental illness and respond to their needs. In addition, <bill type="h" number="3992">H.R. 3992</bill> would authorize funding for developing receiving centers to assess individuals in law enforcement custody for mental health and substance abuse treatment. Such funding would also be used  to improve technology to facilitate information sharing among law enforcement and criminal justice personnel, as well as to promote evidence-based mental health care practices in correctional facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is our moral responsibility to provide timely, appropriate and adequate health care to those in the custody of our correctional system. The treatment of mental illness should be no exception.</paragraph>
