  <speaking speaker="300010" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I rise to acknowledge the very special and meaningful contributions of Ms. Heideh Shahmoradi, who is departing the U.S. Senate after serving as detailee for some 4 years from the Department of Transportation. I come to the floor today to thank personally Heideh for her assistance and professionalism as a detailee to me on both the Environment and Public Works, EPW, Committee and the Appropriations Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my former position as chair of the EPW's Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Heideh provided me with invaluable advice and help in the development and passage of the highway reauthorization legislation, Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users: or SAFETEA. Heideh played a key role in helping the committee understand the complexities and implications of SAFETEA which helped to ensure that the final legislation properly balanced these  very complex policy and funding issues. And as a program expert from the Department, Heideh was able to provide valuable insights on the potential impact of the legislation on highway transportation activities. Heideh not only contributed significantly in analyzing the legislation but she also performed important duties, such as research, fact-checking, editing, and drafting report language and legislation. Heideh did it all with distinction and unflappable good humor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her skills and performance on working on the EPW Committee made it an easy decision to bring her back from the Department to help me on the Appropriations Committee. Heideh not only continued to assist me on the Federal-aid highway programs on the Senate Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, but she also quickly became a resource and expert on all of the other modes under the Department of Transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout her tenure on Capitol Hill, Heideh provided technical expertise and programmatic knowledge that was critical in policymaking decisions on both the authorizing and appropriations committees. Her ability to provide a reality check on legislation helped tremendously in protecting the best interests of our communities and  taxpayers. She is simply a true professional civil servant that we are fortunate to have in government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Heideh is a quick study, adaptable, very good at working with others, and cool under pressure. She also is a person of absolute integrity, honor, and loyalty. To their credit, the leadership at the Department of Transportation has recognized her accomplishments and skills and will be giving her new challenges and opportunities. Her departure is a great loss to the Appropriations Committee and to my office in particular. She will be missed. I strongly commend Heideh for her service to  me and the U.S. Senate and, while she is leaving us, she will always be part of the Bond office team. I personally wish Heideh, her husband Torrance, and her son Corey all the best.</paragraph>
