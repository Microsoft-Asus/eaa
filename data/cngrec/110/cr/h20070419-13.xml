    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1911">H.R. 1911</bill>, the Tax Relief for Working Caregivers Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, the rising costs associated with caring for children and aging parents have placed a significant burden on many middle-class families. Today, more than 16 million Americans have joined the ranks of the new "sandwich generation," those working Americans who provide care for both their own children and for their aging parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, I introduced legislation to provide more tax relief for working families who provide dependent care for their children or parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation does two things. First, it would extend the full benefit of the dependent care tax credit to allow more middle-class families to receive tax relief for the child and elder care expenses they must incur in order to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, the bill expands the credit to include all older dependent parents, not just those who live with the taxpayer. This makes it easier for families to care for their loved ones, while providing the flexibility to maintain a living situation more suited to the family's unique needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask for support for this legislation.</paragraph>
