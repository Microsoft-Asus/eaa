  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, our Nation's haphazard trade policy has done plenty of damage to Ohio's economy, to our workers, to our manufacturers, and to our small businesses. Recent news reports of tainted foods and toxic toys reveal another hazard of ill-conceived and unenforced trade rules. They subject American families and children to products that can harm them, that in some cases have even killed them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From pet food to toothpaste, from tires to toys, news stories almost every day highlight the consequences of our Nation's failed trade policy. Countries such as China lack basic protections we have come to take for granted. Given the well-known dangers of lead, particularly for young children, our Government banned it from products such as gasoline and paint in the 1970s. Yet our trade policy is turning back the clock on the hard-fought safety standards that keep our families and our children  safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What happens should come as no surprise. When we trade the way we do, when we bought $288 billion of products from the People's Republic of China last year and $288 billion this year--it will probably exceed $300 billion--and we are trading with a country that doesn't have close to the same safety standards for its own workers or safe air or drinking water standards for its own water, why would we expect them to sell safe products to our country?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is compounded by the fact that companies, such as Mattel say to the Chinese contractors: We want you to cut costs. Lead paint? Use it; it is cheaper. Cut corners so we can save money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no surprise because American corporations have pushed the Chinese to cut costs, and at the same time China  doesn't have fair labor standards, clean air, and safe drinking water standards for their own people. Of course they are going to sell products back to our country such as contaminated toothpaste and pet food and dangerous toys with lead-based paint on those products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our trade policy should prevent these problems, not invite them. Despite the real and present danger from Chinese imports, we must not focus solely on consumer threats from China. The real threat is our failed trade policy that allows recall after recall. The real threat is our failure to change course and craft a new, very different trade policy. The real threat is this administration's insistence on more of the same--more trade pacts that send U.S. jobs overseas, more trade pacts that allow  companies and countries to ignore the rules of fair trade, more trade  pacts that will mean more tainted products in our homes, more dangerous toys for our children, and more recalls for our businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration and its free-trade supporters in Congress are gearing up for another trade fight. They want to force on our Nation--a nation that in November, in Montana, Ohio, and across the country, demanded change--more job-killing trade agreements with unreliable standards. Free-trade agreements with Peru, Panama, Colombia, and South Korea currently being debated in Congress are based on the same failed trade model.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, the Peru trade agreement is at the forefront of the debate between fundamentally flawed trade models--more of the same--and the fight for fair trade. We want more trade, plenty of trade; we just want fair trade, different rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Peru free-trade agreement, like NAFTA, while it has some improvements over that, puts limits on the safety standards we can require for imports. FDA inspectors have rejected seafood imports from Peru and Panama--major seafood suppliers to the United States. Yet the current trade agreement, as proposed--the Bush administration's Peru and Panama agreements--limits food safety standards and border inspections. What has happened already is where, frankly, we have bought too many contaminated  products, contaminated seafood imports, and whatever problems we have, this trade agreement will make it worse because this agreement will limit our own food safety standards and border inspections. Adding insult to injury, the agreements would force the United States to rely on foreign inspectors to ensure our safety. We have seen how well that worked with China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for a new direction in trade policy. It is time for a trade policy that ensures the safety of food on our kitchen tables and toys in our children's bedrooms. It is time for a trade policy that creates new businesses and good-paying jobs at home instead of a trade policy that encourages companies to outsource and move overseas. It is time for a trade policy that puts an end to the global exploitation of cheap labor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The voters in November shouted from the ballot box, demanding a new trade policy. Their resounding call for a new trade policy put Members of Congress on notice that their trade votes in Washington matter to voters back home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With Peru, Panama, Colombia, and South Korea, voters in my State of Ohio and across the Nation are watching these trade debates. Everyone agrees on one thing: We want more trade with countries around the world, but first we must protect the safety and the health of our families and our children.</paragraph>
