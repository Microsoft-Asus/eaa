  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I just wanted to come back and talk a little bit more about the majority and the work schedule and the work ethics that they seem to be putting forth. I could come up and read my BlackBerry and my schedule to you. I don't know if that is exactly what our constituents had in mind, was electing us and paying us to come up here and go to receptions and go to dinners and travel around ourselves. That  is understandable. I  think what they sent us up here to do was to do the people's business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott) came up and talked about regular order. I just had to come back, Madam Speaker, to address regular order. I have almost forgotten what regular order is because since we have taken over, since the Democrats took over January 4, I guess we have had maybe this bill and one other bill that actually went through regular order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had an organizational meeting for my committees, and I think I have had one other meeting in one of the committees, two hearings or three hearings in another committee, not actually about any of the specific legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In fact, the bills that have come to the floor have been taken out of two of the committees that I serve on to be brought directly to the floor without any kind of markup.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I nicknamed this Congress, Madam Speaker, the smoke and mirrors Congress, and I think that they have done, and I am talking about the majority party that is in control now, have done a wonderful job with smoke and mirrors and fooling the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We did a smoke and mirrors on the minimum wage. We did a smoke and mirrors on the war resolution. We have done several smoke and mirrors, and we continue to do smoke and mirrors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is just like the 5-day work week. They never address the 5-day work week. Where is the 5-day work week? Since the first week of January, we have had one 5-day work week. We may be going to have committee hearings, and we may be going to go to all these parties and receptions and other things, but when are we going to work? Because most of my constituents are at work right now. In fact, most of them, some of them, possibly started at 6 o'clock this morning. A lot of the airline people work  a 5:00 a.m. shift. A lot of them start at 7:00, but we start at 10:00, and I have not had a hearing earlier than 10 o'clock, and today we finished the legislative business at 2:15.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam Speaker, I hear all these things, and I hear some good ideas, and I think the people do want us to work, but let us not campaign on one thing and then come to Washington and do something else. I think the people deserve more than that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, I wanted to address the regular order thing. I am elected by 700,000 people in the Third District of Georgia, and they expect some representation up here, and I do my best to do that. They want a voice in the things that happen on this floor, but yet I have been unable to offer an amendment, unable to offer an amendment when the rules of the House clearly state that every Member of this body has the right to amend a piece of legislation. But when the Rules Committee meet, they waive that  rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is like the smoke and mirrors PAYGO that we got. People are like, oh, yeah, I like that PAYGO. They cannot increase the deficit or anything without making sure that the money is there to pay it. So, man, we love that PAYGO. The problem is that the Rules Committee, in the bill that came that involved that, waived that rule. Smoke and mirrors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam Speaker, I am going to let people rest now. I see that Mrs. Blackburn is here to start her Special Order, but I just want the people, Madam Speaker, to understand that we are up here to do the people's business and not just to talk a good game, but to act a good game. So hopefully they will see that we want to earn ourself back into the majority, and they will have the confidence in us to lead this country once again.</paragraph>
