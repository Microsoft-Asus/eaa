    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I offer a motion to instruct conferees.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Hall of Texas moves that the managers on the part of the House at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the Senate amendment to the bill, <bill type="h" number="2272">H.R. 2272</bill>, be instructed to:</narrative>
  <narrative>(A) insist on the lower overall authorization level as set forth by the House in <bill type="h" number="2272">H.R. 2272</bill>; and</narrative>
  <narrative>(B) insist on the language of subsection (a) of Section 203 of the House bill, relating to prioritization of early career grants to science and engineering researchers for the expansion of domestic energy production and use through coal-to-liquids technology and advanced nuclear reprocessing.</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to clause 7 of rule XXII, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hall) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Wu) each will control 30 minutes.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400165" topic="MOTION TO INSTRUCT OFFERED BY MR. HALL OF TEXAS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to offer a straightforward motion to instruct conferees on <bill type="h" number="2272">H.R. 2272</bill>, a bill to invest in innovation through research and development, and to improve the competitiveness of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This motion to instruct the conferees simply insists that the House conferees support the House position. It does this in two important ways that I believe will make the conference report better and Members on both sides of the aisle proud to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the motion to instruct encourages the conferees to insist on the overall House authorization level, which is considerably lower than the Senate authorization level. In fact, estimates put the bill as passed by the Senate at approximately $40 billion higher than the total House authorization level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, this motion to instruct insists that House conferees support the previously adopted House position with regard to giving priority to grants to expand domestic energy production through the use of coal-to-liquids. That type technology and advanced nuclear reprocessing should be used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this is an important section of the bill that will help to ensure that we are preparing our scientists and our engineers for the future of energy security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Members of the House, both Republicans and Democrats, voted in favor of the authorization level and voted in favor of this program, including my good friend, the chairman of the Science and Technology Committee. I am encouraging Members to stand up for the House position on these two issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I explain the importance of the provision regarding grants to expand energy production, let me take a moment to compare the authorization level in the House bill with the authorization level in the Senate bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the ranking member of the Committee on Science and Technology, I strongly support an increase in funding for the agencies that perform scientific research in this country. Without these agencies, we would fall far behind the rest of the world in innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the greatest inventions of our time have come from the brilliant scientists of our country. To remain competitive as a Nation, we must encourage new ideas and educate new young minds, but we must also be mindful to exercise fiscal responsibility. The young minds we are educating should not be taught irresponsible spending habits. We have to lead by example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House bill contains substantial increases for the sciences very close to the President's request, and moves us closer to the goal the President has set out in the State of the Union Message calling for a doubling of the spending on the sciences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate bill includes a vast increase in spending that is approximately $8 billion above the budget request by the administration for this year alone. I encourage my colleagues to work with me to increase spending on science in a responsible fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we move to conference on the competitiveness bill, I also want to encourage my colleagues to support the provision in the House bill urging researchers to invest time and to invest money into advancing coal-to-liquids technology and nuclear reprocessing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are, as my colleagues stated previously on the floor of this Chamber, several pieces to the energy puzzle. One very important piece continues to be the efficient and affordable research and development of this Nation's domestic energy resources. Twenty-seven percent of the world's recoverable coal reserves are in the United States and spread throughout our country, which would minimize supply disruptions in the event of a natural disaster or in the event of a terrorist attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are currently importing around 60 percent of our oil supply, and that number is projected to grow unless we do something about it. As the Saudi Arabia of coal, if our Nation can economically produce liquid transportation fuel from coal, we can reduce our dependence on foreign sources of oil and increase the security of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also need to better manage our nuclear energy resources. In the pursuit of expanding our nuclear fleet, we should encourage scientists and engineers early in their careers to focus on the development of abandoned nuclear reprocessing technologies. We need to invigorate our aging nuclear sector so this energy source continues to serve as a clean, affordable, domestic energy resource for our consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House may soon be taking up an energy package. To my knowledge, this energy package contains no language on coal-to-liquids and very little on nuclear energy. Given the fact that our Nation's continued growth and prosperity depend on affordable and reliable energy resources, I am disappointed that we are not promoting all options for Americans. This opportunity may be one of the few Members get to support our Nation's coal and our Nation's nuclear interests. We should take every opportunity  to address citizens' concerns with rising energy prices. And that is why I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this provision on this date.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, at this point, we have no further speakers, and  I would yield the floor to the gentleman from Texas.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400165" topic="MOTION TO INSTRUCT OFFERED BY MR. HALL OF TEXAS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, you have indulged me as long as I can ask you to, and so has this gentleman from way out in deep west Texas. I'm honored to be here with him, so I will go ahead and close.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I wrap up here, I want to encourage the House Members to support the authorization level as it remains. It is as appropriate now as it was when the bill was passed overwhelmingly in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I also want to reiterate my frustration of America's continued dependence on foreign sources of energy and encourage my colleagues to explore domestic sources of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For some reason, there's a war against energy from fossil fuels going right on down at this very time, this very day, and I'm not sure why. Anyone with just a little common sense is able to understand that in order to be less dependent on foreign sources of oil and to increase our national security, we need everything we can develop. We need conventional, renewable and alternative sources of energy. Our country at this time will not be able to continue to thrive and lead the world on renewable  energy alone, so to punish the oil and gas industry and to not encourage alternative uses of coal and continued use of nuclear power is to ensure the United States will lose its place as a world leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake, I support the continued development and increased use of renewable energy, but not at the expense of fossil fuels and clean nuclear energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the House is already on record supporting this language and this authorization level just 3 months ago. I can't think of a reason why it wouldn't be supported again today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote to keep this House-passed language in the bill that will result from the conference committee. And, Madam Speaker, thank you for your indulgence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
