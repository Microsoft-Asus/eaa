    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last month the low country director of the office of South Carolina's Second Congressional District departed. Ted Felder, who has served the Second District since my election in 2001, has been named Economic Development Director for the City of Hardeeville, which will be one of the fastest growing cities in America in the next decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a native of St. Matthews, Ted graduated from the University of South Carolina. He and his wife, Beth, have a 9-month-old son, John Goodwin. As a longtime friend of Ted's parents, John and Jane Felder, I have known Ted since he was a small child. I have also had the honor of serving with John in the general assembly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate Ted's dedication to the low country and the needs of its constituents. I know he will bring the same commitment to the residents of Hardeeville. He has trained his successor, Allen Aimar, to be accessible and accountable, with office manager Deanna Conners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops. We will never forget September 11. Our prayers are with Congressman Charlie Norwood, his wife, Gloria, and his family.</paragraph>
