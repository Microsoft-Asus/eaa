    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, earlier this fall I had the privilege to visit Zimmer Manufacturing in Statesville, North Carolina. During my visit to Zimmer's Statesville facility, I witnessed a thriving company committed to producing high quality surgical  products. But as impressed as I was with Zimmer's Statesville plant, I was more impressed with the company's dedication to its employees and their safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This summer the Zimmer plant logged more than 1 million safe hours with no injuries or illnesses that resulted in lost work days. That is nearly four straight years of providing a flawless safety record. So I was not surprised when I found out later that Doug Pond, the supervisor at Zimmer, won first place in the annual North Carolina Statewide Safety Talk Contest hosted by the North Carolina Industrial Commission in Greensboro, North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Zimmer of Statesville for its impressive safety record and for its commitment to providing an accident-free workplace. During these uncertain economic times, it's good to talk about a company that is doing something right.</paragraph>
