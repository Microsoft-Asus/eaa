  <narrative>GOOD WISHES FOR SENATOR KENNEDY -- (Senate - May 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4774">S4774</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in my 11 1/2  years in the Senate, I have worked closely with a very special man, a very caring man, a very liberal man, a very energetic man, a very thoughtful man, and a man who has become my dear friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That man is Senator TED KENNEDY, the Senator from Massachusetts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A great blow was dealt to the Senate when we found out Senator Kennedy had a malignant brain tumor. This blow is not because of what may or may not get done in his absence. No, this blow went straight to the heart of anyone who has known this man as a friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many find it hard to believe that Senator Kennedy, the third most liberal Senator in the Senate, and I, the fourth most conservative Senator in this body, could get along or actually enjoy each other's company. But we do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I was chairman of the HELP Committee, I worked under what I called my 80 percent rule. I always believed we could agree on 80 percent of the issues and on 80 percent of each issue, and that if we focus on the 80 percent, we can do great things for the American people. Senator Kennedy and I worked together on proposals using that rule, and we found that 80 percent in the things we undertook. We also found friendship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In those 2 years, we passed 35 bills out of the Health Education, Labo&amp;amp; Pensions Committee, and the President signed 27 of those into law. Most of them passed almost unanimously. Again, it was kind of the belief that if two people that far apart could come together on an issue, it must be OK. The HELP Committee used to be the most contentious committee in the Senate, but in our 3 years of working together as chairman and ranking member, we turned it into the most productive committee in the  Senate. I  remember being in the President's office at a bill signing and having him say, "You know, you are the only committee sending me anything." We got to checking on it, and he was right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could not help but think of my friend as I stood next to the President while he signed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act a few weeks ago. That bill was the fourth bill that month Senator Kennedy and I sent to the President. We had worked on it for several years, and we are glad it finally passed, almost unanimously. We briefly conferenced it with the other side, so the differences are already worked out before they vote on the bill. It went to the President's desk. That  is a perfect example of how we worked together to pass legislation that had been held up for years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another example is the mine safety law. In 6 weeks, we worked together to pass the first changes to mine safety law in almost 30 years. The average bill around here takes about 6 years to pass. That one happened in 6 weeks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We share an incurable optimism, and if you add that in with TED's work ethic and my persistence, you have a great recipe for success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we don't get along, you will see us come to the Senate floor and debate our policy differences passionately. Once the votes are cast and we walk off the floor, we move on to tackle the next issue, and we do that as colleagues with a deep respect for the other person and his beliefs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have taken trips around the country together to look at mine safety and hurricane damage. I have also invited Vicki and TED to come to Wyoming to dig fossils with Diana and me when our schedules can work it in. We have some 60-million-year-old fossil fish in Wyoming. If you ever see the brown bones of a fish in a piece of white rock, it undoubtedly came from Wyoming. If you see brown bones in a brown rock, it probably came from the other place, which would be China. But I have invited  him out to do a little fishing in the fossil field with me. This week I even sent him a very small one that we might be able to use for bait if we get to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, if you are listening, I do still expect you to make that trip to Wyoming for the fossil dig.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Kennedy has a very deep human side. Although he has one of the busiest schedules of any Senator, he makes time to do small things for those around him. There is a program called Everybody Wins; it is a reading program, where an individual who is willing to volunteer their time meets each week with a young person and they read. One reads to the other, and the other reads back. It is a tremendous help to kids in reading. But to do that, you have to sacrifice an hour each week,  and you work with the same child each week. Senator Kennedy does that. Not many people make that kind of a time commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Kennedy is also thoughtful. I will always remember when he brought me a gift when each of my grandchildren was born. One happened to be a little pair of training pants that said "Irish Mist" on the back. He even treats my staff like family. He made a copy of the painting he made for Vicki on their wedding day and presented it to my scheduler when she got engaged. He always makes a special point to thank my staff on the Senate floor for all their hard work to get their bills  through. He somehow finds time for all these things. He also came to a staff coffee in my office. Every month, we do a staff coffee, and that means I invite two Democratic Senate offices and two Republican staff offices to come to my office, so people can meet their counterparts in a less violent situation than working on a bill. If they know their counterparts--if you get to know somebody,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Kennedy has quite a few friends from Wyoming, one of which is the former Senator Al Simpson. Al and Senator Kennedy worked together for many years. They even did a little radio program. So when I was elected, my first bill was one dealing with OSHA. That is one of the primary areas of interest of Senator Kennedy. He was ranking member on the committee. After I got it drafted, I went around to every member of the committee and I pleaded with them and they sat  down and went through the bill with me, a section at a time, and asked questions. I answered them. The last person I had on the list to talk to--and the most formidable, in my view, because I knew his history--was Senator Kennedy. So to get permission to meet with him, I called Al Simpson and said: Could you talk to Senator Kennedy for me and see if he would meet with me to go through this bill?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next day I got a call from Senator Kennedy, who said: Yes, come on down to my office. I will meet with you. So I went down there. My mother had been named "Mother of the Year" for Wyoming the day before, and he presented me with clippings of my mother's award. He went through that bill with me, a section at a time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It wasn't until the markup of the bill that I found out that was not the way you did things around here. He explained that in his, I think, 35 years at that time, he had never had a Senator ask him to sit down and go through a bill a section at a time. The bill did not pass, but several sections of the bill are now law. It was the first eight changes in OSHA in the history of OSHA. After we did those eight changes, he came to me and said: I have this needle stick bill I have been trying to get  through. Would you take a look at it?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did. We made some changes to get to the 80-percent rule, and it passed unanimously here and in the House and the President signed it. The nurses were appreciative and the janitors were appreciative because either of them could get an accidental needle stick and they wouldn't know where it had been and they would have to wait months to find out if they were going to get something from it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I learned a lot from each of these opportunities to work with TED KENNEDY. I had no idea I would be chairman of the committee, and he would be the ranking member. Then I had no idea the majority would change and he would become chairman and I would become ranking member. I remember meeting with him after he became chairman, where we took a look at the bills we intended to get done during these 2 years, and we have had pretty substantial progress on that. I told him I was glad he was chairman  because after I had studied under him for 2 years, I would be able to do a much better job when I became chairman again. He laughed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A week ago today, we were resolving some issues on the floor and several other things we are trying to get done, and I remember being over in that corner where he was telling me about his dad's recipe for daiquiris, and earlier this week we passed the National Day of the American Cowboy, and that reminded me of an incident in Montana when Senator Kennedy was helping his brother, he actually went to a bucking horse sale and rode a bucking horse and wound up on the cover of LIFE magazine--to  get the Kennedy name out to help get his brother nominated. As a result, Montana and Wyoming both went for Senator John F. Kennedy and put him over the top for the nomination to be President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a lot of other stories I would like to tell, but I will not because of the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TED, my chairman, Diana and I are praying for you and your family during this trying time. "Cancer" is the last word any family wants to hear. I know you will fight it; you have that fighting spirit. I wish to see you at the next bill signing in the President's office and with me again in the HELP Committee hearing room. We have more bills to pass, fossils to dig, fights to battle, and laughs to enjoy together. We have to keep up our bill-of-the-month club for the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I echo the words of my friend, Senator Enzi from Wyoming, about Senator Kennedy. I have had the honor for only 15 months now to serve on his and Senator Enzi's HELP Committee. Even more important than Senator Enzi points out and even more important than Senator Kennedy's passion for his work, his commitment to social and  economic justice and his never, ever giving up in fighting for  those things he believes in, is what Senator Kennedy does personally for all kinds of people, including people who don't live in his State, people whom he has never met, people who walk down the hall. He brings them into his office and gives</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Senator Enzi does, I hope Senator Kennedy will be back here as strong as ever. He has used that energy and passion for so many others, and he will put that same energy and passion into being cured. We all look forward to that day in the fairly near future.</paragraph>
