  <speaking speaker="300010" topic="CONGRATULATING JOSHUA KORS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Joshua Kors on winning the George Polk Award for magazine reporting and his selection as a finalist for Harvard's Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful for the work Mr. Kors has done on behalf of our troops and for the leadership he has demonstrated in his relentless pursuit of the facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America counts on its investigative reporters to expose corruption, mismanagement and abuse, particularly in government. Mr. Kors' work brought to light the military's appalling misuse of administrative discharges for many of our combat-wounded soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Kors' profile of the difficulties SPC Jon Town encountered after returning from Iraq showed all of us in troubling detail the devastating impact of the Pentagon's policy on one soldier and his family--a story which is repeated in the lives of too many others similarly discharged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the lives and livelihoods of these wounded warriors on the line, Mr. Kors' reporting has clearly made a difference already.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is now up to Congress to ensure that the Department of Defense treats our soldiers fairly. Our troops have courageously put themselves in harm's way and it is incumbent upon our government to ensure that they receive the best possible care when they return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us on Capitol Hill have pledged to continue to fight to eliminate the misuse of personality discharges through all legislative and administrative means at our disposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Mr. Kors for his outstanding work and congratulate him on his accomplishments.</paragraph>
