  <narrative>THE PRESIDENT SHOULD REVOKE BAN ON EXPLORATION OF THE OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5416]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400285" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, oil prices climb to record highs; gasoline over $4; diesel prices near $5; family budgets stretched to the limits. And how do we handle this? We beg OPEC to produce more oil. The Saudis say they will give us 200,000 more barrels a day in the world market, but the daily world demand is 84 million barrels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hey, how about putting the U.S. in charge of our own economy? What about American energy? Sixty-four percent of Americans support American-made energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I will introduce a resolution calling upon the President to revoke a ban President Clinton extended in 1998 that prohibits exploration of our Outer Continental Shelf. The U.S. has the technology and regulatory framework to ensure that these resources are developed in an environmentally sound manner. The President has the power to remove this ban today, if he chooses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I invite all my colleagues to cosponsor my resolution, and send a clear signal to the President and to the American people that we will help.</paragraph>
