    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as we approach the Fourth of July, I want to thank our troops in Iraq, Afghanistan and across the world. It is because of their service that we are able to celebrate our freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my seven visits to Iraq and three to Afghanistan, I have seen firsthand the new greatest generation. Our coalition forces are stopping the terrorists overseas to protect American families at home. Osama bin Laden's right-hand man and al Qaeda spokesman Zawahiri has proclaimed that Iraq and Afghanistan are the central fronts in the global war on terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to honoring the sacrifices of our troops this Fourth of July weekend at the Celebration of Liberty service with Pastor Wendell Estep of First Baptist Church in Columbia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.</paragraph>
