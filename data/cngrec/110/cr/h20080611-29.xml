    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, where is a good Samaritan? My friends are talking about the high price of gasoline. Can you imagine the impact on those who have exhausted their unemployment, people who have built this Nation, hard-working Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do you recognize that just this past week, unfortunately, with embarrassment, the administration had to announce that unemployment rose 5 percent in April, 5.5 percent in May, 49,000 jobs were lost. Where is the good Samaritan?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why today Democrats will stand on the floor of the House and stand alongside of working Americans and extend the unemployment benefits for those families who have exhausted all of their resources, this will go into March 2009, helping the bus driver, the nurse, helping those who are working with their hands, who have families to support, who can barely get gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Can you imagine being unemployed through no fault of your own, and this administration does not want to offer the extension of unemployment benefits? Today the good Samaritan will be on the floor of the House. We will debate this question. We will pass this bill. The President will sign it, and we will give relief to hard-working Americans.</paragraph>
