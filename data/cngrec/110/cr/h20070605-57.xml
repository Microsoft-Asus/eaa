    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join others in commemorating the life and legacy of Congressman Parren J. Mitchell. Growing up in Baltimore, I came to understand the tremendous positive impact this great man had on my community, the State of Maryland and indeed this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first African American Congressman from my State, Parren Mitchell fought against racism at every turn, but he fought on other fronts as well, wherever he saw injustice, and inhumanity. At his memorial service earlier today in Baltimore, we heard again and again of a man unafraid to speak truth to power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to share my own personal story of how I felt the presence of this man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some years ago, Congressman Mitchell was honored at the 15th anniversary of the Public Justice Center, an organization committed to building systemic change in our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was an easy choice to salute Congressman Mitchell, but it was not easy for him to attend the event. He was by then quite frail, and as he was helped to the stage to receive the honor, I remember wondering whether he would have the energy to speak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I needn't have worried. A steady and resonant voice filled the hall, and from this slightly built man, at that point in his life no longer able to stand up, came simple and powerful words of gratitude and inspiration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He spoke at length and without hesitation about his core principles of honesty, justice and compassion. It was, Mr. Speaker, a tour de force. I can only imagine what that voice was like when it held forth in this Chamber and carried the day on so many critical issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Something else happened that night that is worth relating. After Congressman Mitchell finished speaking, the organization honored a young man from the community who had struggled and succeeded in overcoming unfair labor practices in his industry. That young man, looking out on a crowd of 500 people, said this: "We need to make sure that the big corporations pay the little guy for the hard work."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I looked at Congressman Mitchell, and I saw a smile creeping across his face. It was truth to power at its very best, all that Parren Mitchell had ever stood for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to salute this fine American and great son of Baltimore.</paragraph>
