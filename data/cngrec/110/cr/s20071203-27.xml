    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss of Kenneth Thomas Novel. Kenneth passed away after a battle with liver cancer on November 14 at his home in Gaithersburg, MD. He was 60 years of age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kenneth was born in New York City, NY, on January 30, 1947. He was a Vietnam veteran who served with the "Screaming Eagles" of the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam in 1968. On November 20, Kenneth Novel was buried with full military honors at the Columbarium in Arlington National Cemetery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kenneth was an owner of O Salon in Georgetown along with his brother, Robert. His career spanned more than 38 years between Washington, DC and Aspen, CO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kenneth Novel was a devoted family man. He is survived by his loving wife Theresa; three children, Lisa Hackett, Simone and Anthony; two grandchildren, Jake and Luke; and two brothers, Gene and Robert Novel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lilibet and I, and all of Kenneth's friends, offer our prayers to Theresa and the Novel family. Kenneth was an American patriot who believed in his country and fought for his country. America owes him our thanks for his contributions and sacrifice. He will be missed by many of us.</paragraph>
