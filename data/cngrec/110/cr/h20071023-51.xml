    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1011">H.R. 1011</bill>, the Virginia Ridge and Valley Act of 2007, introduced by my colleague from Virginia's Ninth Congressional District, Congressman Rick Boucher. I am proud to have been an original cosponsor of this important conservation legislation in this Congress and in the last Congress and I commend Congressman Boucher for all his hard work on this bill over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan bill will protect approximately 54,000 acres of the Jefferson National Forest in Virginia through the designation of additional wilderness areas and the creation of new National Scenic Areas. Although mechanized traffic and equipment would be prohibited in much of these areas, recreational activities would be permitted and encouraged throughout these new designations contributing to the local economy of Southwest Virginia. Protecting these additional acres of pristine forest will  ensure that future generations will be able to enjoy the natural beauty of Southwest Virginia. We must also be vigilant in protecting environmentally sensitive areas by promoting responsible land use plans, which this bill does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today was reported out of the Natural Resources Committee by voice vote, is endorsed by the U.S. Forest Service, and is supported by Virginia Governor Tim Kaine, members from both parties in the Virginia delegation, both of Virginia's Senators, John Warner and Jim Webb, the Board of Supervisors in Bland County, Craig County, Montgomery County, and Smyth County, and various environmental organizations, including the League of Conservation Voters, the  Garden Club of Virginia, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society, and the Virginia Wilderness Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill is vitally important to conservation efforts in the Commonwealth of Virginia and to guaranteeing that future generations of Americans can experience the natural wonder and beauty of Southwest Virginia. I applaud Congressman Boucher and his staff for all of their hard work on this bill. I encourage my colleagues to support the legislation and I encourage each of them to experience firsthand the pristine natural beauty of Southwest Virginia.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1011">H.R. 1011</bill>, the Virginia Ridge and Valley Act, was introduced by my friend and neighboring colleague, Representative Rick Boucher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill designates nearly 40,000 acres in the Jefferson National Forest as wilderness and nearly 12,000 acres as National Scenic Areas. These natural spaces represent some of the true wild gems of the Commonwealth of Virginia and my State of West Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1011">H.R. 1011</bill> is a strong bipartisan measure that is cosponsored by several other representatives from Virginia. <bill type="h" number="1011">H.R. 1011</bill> also has broad support from Governor Tim Kaine, both Virginia Senators, four county boards of supervisors, local businesses, State organizations, hunters and faith groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each of the areas within <bill type="h" number="1011">H.R. 1011</bill> were either recommended for wilderness designation in the 2004 Jefferson National Forest Plan or have been endorsed by the local board of supervisors of the relevant county. All the areas of <bill type="h" number="1011">H.R. 1011</bill> are located within the district of Representative Boucher, who has been a true leader and fighter for this legislation and deserves the commendation of us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All are located within his District, as I said, with the exception of a 555 wilderness-acre addition that I am proud to note is in my congressional district in Monroe County, West Virginia. Wilderness designation is not new to this portion of Virginia. In addition to designating six new wilderness areas, the legislation provides for additions to six existing wilderness areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of this area are well acquainted with wilderness, and <bill type="h" number="1011">H.R. 1011</bill> reflects their desire to preserve these natural treasures. By designating wilderness, the Congress has long recognized that there are some places that should be left to the management of Mother Nature and that the all-knowing Creator's careful handiwork is something worth conserving and cherishing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1011">H.R. 1011</bill> is a well-crafted and meritorious measure that has broad support for those who live in the area and their elected officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill in the House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400440" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come from a State which has more of its land locked up in wilderness than any other State, 58 million acres. This is larger than the entire State of New York and accounts for 56 percent of all the wilderness in the United States, so I think I know wilderness. I know that a lot of wilderness in Alaska is designated for reasons that have little to do with the stated goals of the Wilderness Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The designations have blocked vital uses of these lands and blocked access to State and private resources that we Alaskans were promised when we entered statehood. There have been and still are major consequences for what Congress did in 1980. In the East, where most of you come from, that is not always the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All I can say is that if this is what Mr. Boucher and his constituents want in Virginia, then good luck. I can guess that one day, I think that one day they will regret this action. Given Virginia's population growth, the severe risk of forest fires, such as they are in California today, caused by sustained drought, I believe all but two counties have been declared disaster areas by the Governor last week, problems with gypsy moths and other agricultural threats to this area and the  dampening effect that wilderness restrictions can have on the development of adjacent areas, you may wonder why you have brought this upon yourself. We should be looking to give the Forest Service more tools to manage our lands, not taking them away, which is exactly what wilderness does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once this bill becomes law, our constituents, your constituents, may find that they may not be able to burn wood in their fireplaces that keep them warm in the winter because their quality of wilderness must be protected, or that a new school or hospital can't be built because the view shed for the wilderness could be affected. People are even talking about "smellscapes" when it comes to wilderness areas, so enjoy your Weber grill right now while you can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee should also know that <bill type="h" number="1011">H.R. 1011</bill> designates nearly 27,000 acres of wilderness above what was recommended by the Forest Service. This is contrary to the recently revised Jefferson National Forest Plan, which took 11 years, millions of dollars, and extensive public involvement to create. We asked for this study. They followed the rules, but now we are ignoring the professional land managers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, <bill type="h" number="1011">H.R. 1011</bill> will endanger citizens living near this proposed wilderness area by tying the hands of the Forest Service, who need to perform proactive treatments that could reduce the risk of wildfires. Wildfires, I keep stressing that because we are seeing what is happening in California. If they cleared off those forests around those homes, they would not be burning today, but that was prohibited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nonqualifying areas are now being actively managed for endangered threatened species protection, and this could come to an end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment filed by Mr. Goodlatte helps mitigate some of these issues, and I will strongly support the amendment. Most notably, the amendment will remove 26 acres which contain a power line and remove 1,263 acres from the proposed designation to allow continued use of the Barton Gap Motorized trail and Wildlife Habitat Management in key areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could go on and on about this. I just want to warn people, it is not the area we are talking about; it is the Wilderness Act itself, and it should be upgraded. I encourage my chairman to do so so that we can address those problems that can occur from the designation of wilderness, taking care of gypsy moths, taking care of the fires, taking care of the ability to access and to have the availability of the area for public use. If we do not do that, then I think we are doing ourselves a great  mistake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not live in this area. I am not affected by it. That's why, very frankly, I am not raising some of the objections that I should have raised to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think you will learn, though, in the long run, you are not doing yourselves a favor. The Forest Service themselves can manage this land in a manner that will take and provide for the people. It  does not have to be designated as a wilderness area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, it has already been done. We have moved it out of committee, and I will say, again, may I not be on this floor when you come back to say we have to revise it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm very proud to yield 5 minutes to my dear friend and the very powerful subcommittee Chair of Energy and Air Quality, Mr. Boucher.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. BOUCHER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Rahall) who, with such distinction, chairs the Committee on Natural Resources, for his leadership and his very able assistance in bringing this measure to the House floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, I introduced the legislation, along with other members of Virginia's House delegation. In fact, original cosponsors of this legislation comprise a majority of Virginia's House delegation, and it is a bipartisan majority of that delegation. And I want to express my appreciation to our colleagues from Virginia, Representatives Wolf, Davis, Scott and Moran for coauthoring the bill, along with me, and for their strong support of this effort. I would also note,  Mr. Speaker, that the legislation was coauthored by our recently departed colleague, Mrs. Davis as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, on a bipartisan basis, Virginia's United States Senators have introduced a measure identical to the bill that is under consideration today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Virginia Ridge and Valley Act offers needed protection to 53,000 acres of national forest land in the congressional district that I have the privilege of representing. It extends protection to approximately 550 acres of the Jefferson National Forest situated in our neighboring State of West Virginia, in the congressional district represented by Chairman Rahall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of the total acreage protected, 43,000 acres will receive the wilderness designation, and 10,000 acres will become new national scenic areas. These designations confer both economic and environmental benefits that are of great importance to our region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Virginia's national forest provides an excellent outdoor experience with our State's highest mountains, fast-flowing rivers and superb hunting, camping, fishing, backpacking, winter sports and other activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our existing wilderness areas are treasured by a growing number of travelers who collectively are boosting Virginia's tourism economy. In fact, tourism is among the fastest growing of all the industries in my congressional district; and our existing wilderness areas, which are a haven for outdoor activities and recreation of various kinds, are a significant contributor to that current growth in the economy within my region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The protections we're extending today for lands containing rare treasures of Virginia's natural heritage and the permanent protection that will then be afforded will further enhance our region's travel economy. These designations also protect old-growth timber, wildlife habitat, and our region's clean water resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Virginia has a long and proud history of resource conservation and protection of our diverse ecosystems. We have continual awareness of the unique role that our natural landscape plays in our culture and in our State's history. That awareness is reflected in the bipartisan support for this measure in both our House and Senate delegations. It is reflected in the endorsement of this bill by local governments in my congressional district, and it is reflected in the endorsements for the bill of numerous  civic organizations and literally of scores of local businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With thanks to the six Virginia cosponsors, and all who have assisted us, and particular thanks to Chairman Rahall of the Natural Resources Committee, and his outstanding staff, I urge passage of the Virginia Ridge and Valley Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last several weeks, I have been engaged in discussions with my friend and colleague, the gentleman from our neighboring Sixth Congressional district in Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) regarding the possibility of adjusting the boundaries of some of the areas receiving protection in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Goodlatte will be offering an amendment shortly that reflects our conversations and our agreement to adjust some of those boundaries. I'll be urging the adoption of Mr. Goodlatte's amendment when that amendment is offered later this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, again, thank the gentleman from West Virginia for yielding this time to me.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400440" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman that just spoke and his presentation. I just, again, wish that people would understand it's not the wilderness itself; it's how the act has been written. And if you think you're going to make a living off of coffee shops and tourism, these are low-grade paying jobs. I've seen it happen. I've seen my town of Ketchikan. We created a forest that we can't harvest and we took $80,000 jobs now down to the minimum wage. That will happen too.  So I just, and it's too late, it's your district. You believe in what you say, and I commend you for it. But this is not the economy which I see, serving those that come from the larger urban areas, the elitists, as I call it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this area, by the way, was farmed at one time, as you know, and timbered and mined. People had jobs that provided and produced. We are rapidly becoming a Nation of consumption and of no production, of pleasure and no sweat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having said that, I have no other speakers, and yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in 1964 Congress created the Wilderness Preservation System to recognize and protect pure, untarnished areas of land. With a wilderness designation, the land is off-limits to development, natural resource extraction and most forms of mechanized activity. Congress created this system as they witnessed these natural splendors continuing to disappear. Forty years later, lands remain eligible for such a designation, but Congress has failed to provide them protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These areas are rarer today than ever before. Failure to protect them now would leave them vulnerable to actions that could jeopardize the inherent qualities that make them eligible to be classified as wilderness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With passage, the House will designate 43,000 acres of the Jefferson National Forest as wilderness and add 12,000 acres to the National Scenic Areas inventory. With this action we will ensure our nation's children and grandchildren visiting our great Commonwealth in the years to come, will have the same access to pristine lands as was available to us and those who preceded us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The solitude that can be found in these areas is something every American should experience. It harkens back to the founding of this great nation and provides an insight into the minds of those gone by.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we continue to experience economic gains, we can also expect continued population growth, sprawl and strain on our environment. With these combined factors, our untarnished lands grow increasingly vulnerable, but they also grow increasingly valuable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us act to protect them now. Protect them for their beauty. Protect them for their purity. Protect them for our children.</paragraph>

    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1011">H.R. 1011</bill>, the Virginia Ridge and Valley Act, creates over 40,000 acres of wilderness, wilderness study, and potential wilderness and over 11,000 acres of national scenic areas in the Jefferson National Forest in southwest Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Boucher and I share the Jefferson National Forest between our districts. Although this bill affects only national forest land within Mr. Boucher's district, any change in how the forest is managed will impact my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment addresses three areas. First, it modifies the boundary of the Brush Mountain East Wilderness Area, removing 26 acres containing a power line which is not consistent with wilderness qualities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the amendment changes the boundaries of the Seng Mountain National Scenic Area, removing 1,263 acres from the area to allow continued use of the Barton Gap Motorized Trail and to allow for wildlife habitat management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the amendment changes the trail language for the Raccoon Branch Area, allowing the Forest Service more flexibility when building the trail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I'm pleased to offer this amendment, it does not resolve all the concerns I have with the bill. The fact still remains that this bill ignores the recommendations of the professional land managers working in the Jefferson National Forest by designating 15,000 additional wilderness acres not recommended in the forest plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the House Agriculture Committee held a hearing on <bill type="h" number="1011">H.R. 1011</bill> earlier this month, several witnesses highlighted serious concerns with these additional wilderness areas. These experts noted forest health and wildfire risks, increased recreation conflicts, lack of suitability as wilderness and wildlife management needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is a reason why Congress mandated that each national forest create a forest plan. Forest plans help the land management agencies find a balance among all the conflicting interests in national forests and factor in the latest science and cite specific qualities unique to each forest. Professional land managers then use this information to chart a path for managing each forest for the coming years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Jefferson Forest Plan, finalized in 2004, was developed over a 12-year period and involved countless scientists, land managers, interest groups and interested citizens. Throughout the process, the Forest Service held over 100 technical meetings and received over 15,000 public comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This local approach is what Congress intended when it established the national forests. Instead of resisting this localized process, <bill type="h" number="1011">H.R. 1011</bill> tells the professional land managers and the public participants that the forest plan is not important. It says that no matter how much discussion and compromise goes on at the local level, or how good the science is, Congress knows best how to manage the national forest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is not the best way to manage the Nation's public forests. And that's why I have worked with my colleague, Mr. Boucher, to try to rectify these concerns. Until this bill is more reflective of the local perspectives and expert opinions in the forest plan, I will continue to have concerns with <bill type="h" number="1011">H.R. 1011</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on this amendment, however, because I do think that the gentleman has been very forthcoming in working with us and hearing our concerns. And I hope that that will continue as this process moves forward, and I would hope that the chairman of the Resources Committee would work with us as well to continue to address concerns that we have as the bill moves through the other body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his hard work on this legislation, for his willingness to work with me in addressing these concerns. I wish more had been addressed, but I thank him for where he has come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <narrative>(Mr. BOUCHER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) for the good work that we have been able to do together on the amendment that he offers this afternoon. I want to thank him for the time that he and I have expended in conversations about the subject matter the amendment addresses, and for the considerable amount of time that his very capable staff and mine have also expended on this matter. The staffs have focused on it a bit more than we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Collectively, I think we've done a very good job in addressing a range of the concerns that the gentleman from Virginia last expressed. These adjustments are being made in a manner which I think improves the bill, and it is my intention to urge that the amendment be adopted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the amendment, 26 acres will be removed from the Brush Mountain East Wilderness Area in order to ensure that an existing power line is not within the wilderness boundary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another adjustment is of 1,263 acres, and that is in the Seng Mountain Scenic Area, which will carve out a motorcycle trail and an area appropriate for bear habitat management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another portion of the amendment provides greater flexibility for the Forest Service regarding trail construction adjacent to the Raccoon Branch designated area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as I indicated, these changes improve the legislation, and I urge adoption of the amendment which makes them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As for the underlying bill, I would point out that this is truly a bipartisan measure. It is cosponsored in this body by a majority of Virginia's House delegation, including three original Republican sponsors, three original Democratic sponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the other body, both of Virginia's United States Senators, on a bipartisan basis, have introduced the identical measure. And so the construction of this legislation arises from a deep bipartisan conversation that has proceeded over a number of years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also strongly reflects the desires of the people in the district that I have the privilege of representing. It is true that some of the areas added for protection in this measure go beyond what the forest plan devised by the Jefferson National Forest management had recommended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>But nowhere is it written that Congress making ultimate public policy is in some way disabled from adding areas for protection that go beyond what the agency suggests it would like to see.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have incorporated the recommendations made in the forest plan, and we have added selected additional acreages that have been endorsed by the local governments, by the elected boards of supervisors that reflect the will of the people and the counties where these added areas are situated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also note that large numbers of civic organizations and scores of locally owned businesses have endorsed the passage of this measure. And it clearly, given that broad base of support, bipartisan here, and among elected representatives, local businesses, civic organizations, and others in the district that I represent, clearly represents the will of what the people in that part of Virginia would like to have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I hope that our colleagues will join us in approving this legislation and in adopting the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412191" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Yes, in its current form.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Clerk will report the motion to recommit.</chair>
  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative> Mr. Lamborn moves to recommit the bill <bill type="h" number="1011">H.R. 1011</bill> to the Committee on Natural Resources with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At the end of section 2, add the following new subsection:</narrative>
  <narrative> (e) Motorized Access in Emergencies.--The designation of lands as wilderness or a wilderness study area by an amendment made by this section does not prohibit the use of motor vehicles, motorized equipment, or motorboats or the landing of aircraft or other forms of mechanical transport, on the designated lands when required in connection with an emergency involving the health and safety of persons, including search and rescue efforts or the response to an Amber Alert.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412191" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Wilderness Act is currently unclear as to when motorized access may be used for health and safety reasons in a wilderness area or in a wilderness study area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This motion to recommit removes any ambiguity regarding the legality of responding to health and safety emergencies within the wilderness area designated by this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Current law does not specifically authorize the use of motorized or mechanical equipment within wilderness areas in response to health and safety emergencies. The provision in the Wilderness Act dealing with health and safety issues is in parentheses and does not clearly define what types of motorized vehicles may be allowed for emergencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is that health, safety, and fire concerns merit more than a single phrase in parentheses, as is the case in the Wilderness Act of 1964. There are 3,600 words in the Wilderness Act. A mere 15 words are devoted to health and safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we are considering, <bill type="h" number="1011">H.R. 1011</bill>, designates 15,000 more wilderness acres than what the Forest Service recommended in the Jefferson National Forest. This is far more than what Forest Service professionals think is warranted. So the bigger the area, the bigger the potential fire, the harder it is to find a missing child, for instance, when an Amber Alert is issued.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot stand by and risk even a single human life, which is why we must begin to update the law to state clearly that a wilderness designation does not stop motorized access from being used for emergencies. The current ambiguity in the language, which this motion to recommit fixes, is just simply unacceptable, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment does not threaten the wilderness designation. It just puts our priorities in the proper order. Human life must always be first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from West Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Colorado's amendment would appear to be a restatement of what current law already is. And reading from that current law, it says, "Except as specifically provided for in this act, and subject to existing private rights, there shall be no commercial enterprise and no permanent road within any wilderness area designated by this act and, except as necessary to meet minimum requirements for the administration of the area for the purpose of this act (including  measures required in emergencies involving the health and safety of persons within the area), there shall be no temporary road, no use of motor vehicles, motorized equipment," et cetera, et cetera.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So there are exceptions in current law for health and safety of persons. So I would say to the gentleman that the gentleman's recommittal motion is redundant with current law.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412191" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412191" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just briefly in response, I would like to say that the parenthetical phrase "including measures required in emergencies" is, I believe, unacceptably vague. It should not have to be the case where a Forest supervisor has to go get attorneys and call the lawyers to say, In this case, here's the situation: Is a boat okay or do we have to use horseback or can we go on foot? It's just simply not clear enough.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, I would respond to the gentleman that if such were necessary, I would think that the Forest Service would come to us making these recommendations. But we have not received such recommendations from the Forest Service, and, therefore, the language is not necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair>PERSONAL EXPLANATION&lt;ul&gt;</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412222" topic="NOT VOTING--18">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tonight, as part of consideration of the Virginia Ridge and Valley Act of 2007, the minority offered a motion to recommit forthwith with the proclaimed intent of clarifying the circumstances under which motorized vehicles can enter wilderness areas. However, I am concerned that the language of the motion may actually work at cross purposes with that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The MTR stated that: "The designation of lands as wilderness or a wilderness study area by an amendment made by this section does not prohibit the use of motor vehicles, motorized equipment, or motorboats or the landing of aircraft or other forms of mechanical transport, on the designated lands when required in connection with an emergency involving the health and safety of persons, including search and rescue efforts or the response to an Amber Alert."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know anyone who believes that we shouldn't be able to use motorized equipment in a wilderness to react to an emergency. It's common sense, and that's why it's already included in the underlying statute. In fact, the underlying law makes the allowance for motorized equipment in a health or safety emergency without enumerating specific types of equipment or circumstances, giving the widest possible scope of interpretation. I am concerned that by listing specific pieces of equipment and  circumstances, the motion offered tonight could have caused more confusion and possibly limited the ability to respond to emergencies, despite any good intentions. For this reason, I voted against it.</paragraph>
