  <speaking speaker="300006" topic="SPECIALIST JOHNATHAN ALAN LAHMANN">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude I honor the life of a brave soldier from Richmond, IN. SPC Johnathan Lahmann, 21 years old, died December 10th in Tikrit, Iraq. Specialist Lahmann died of injuries he sustained in Bayhi, Iraq, when an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle. With an optimistic future before him, John risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John was a 2004 graduate of Richmond High School where he avidly studied auto repair with plans to be a mechanic. According to his teacher, Roy Reisinger, John was so dedicated to studying auto repair that he would go to Mr. Reisinger's house on the weekends to work on cars. Mr. Reisinger described John to a local newspaper as "a top-notch mechanic" and "an all-around good young man." In addition to his strong work ethic praised by his teachers, his fellow classmates recall John's pleasant  demeanor and his friendship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduation, John worked at Mosey Manufacturing. In September 2005, John joined the Army, where he was trained as a combat engineer. He was assigned to the 59th Engineer Company, 20th Engineer Battalion, 36th Engineer Brigade, Fort Hood, TX. In November 2007, John was deployed to Iraq. He is survived by his parents, Linda and Alan C. Lahmann.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I join John's family and friends in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will remember when they think of John. Today and always, John will be remembered by family members, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I search for words to do justice in honoring John's sacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: "We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here." This statement is just  as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain that the impact of John's actions will live on far longer than any record of these words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my sad duty to enter the name of SPC Johnathan Alan Lahmann in the official record of the United States Senate for his service to this country and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like John's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, "He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe  away tears from off all faces."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be with all of you, as I know He is with Johnathan.</paragraph>
