    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am especially proud to rise today in honor or the Rotella Interdistrict Magnet School in Waterbury, Connecticut, which recently received the Ronald Simpson Deserved Merit Award. This award, considered the highest recognition for magnet schools in the Nation, is given to only one school a year for its exceptional academic standards and achievements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Rotella School is a dynamic learning community of 600 students in pre-kindergarten through fifth grade. Rotella serves urban and suburban students who represent a diverse group of backgrounds from around Waterbury. Its unique, art-based curriculum challenges students to excel, and encourages them to express themselves through arts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Students who are exposed to the arts have higher test scores, better school attendance and increased self-discipline. Rotella is a testament to the power of arts in education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am deeply proud to stand here today in recognition of Rotella, its administrators, its students for their contribution to our community. They are truly an inspiration to Waterbury. I also commend Rotella's principal, Gina Calabrese, for outstanding work at Rotella and receiving this distinguished award.</paragraph>
