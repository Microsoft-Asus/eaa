  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, following leader time, there will be a period of morning business for Senators, and they will be able to speak for up to 10 minutes each. There are no votes today, but this is going to be a very busy week. We have a certain number of things we have to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to do as many circuit judges as we can. We will certainly at least do one. We have the budget conference report we have to complete. We hope to go to that on Thursday at about 4 o'clock. And, of course, the big one we have to do is the supplemental appropriations bill regarding the war funding in Iraq. Those things we have to complete before we leave here. The budget and the supplemental we have to finish before we leave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I indicated, we are going to have some things here on Wednesday in the Capitol regarding President Johnson. From 11 until 12 noon on Wednesday, there will be a time set aside on the Senate floor for tributes to the former President on the centennial of his birth.</paragraph>
