    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if I could inquire from my colleague from California if she has finished with her speakers.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Yes, I have.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400367" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield the balance of my time to the distinguished gentleman from Ohio, the minority leader, Mr. Boehner.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me thank my colleague from Texas for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, posted on the Speaker of the House's Web site at this moment is a document entitled "A New Direction for America." In this document, the following statement is highlighted: Bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full, and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last November when Democrats were preparing to take control of this Chamber, I appreciated something that Speaker Pelosi said. And I quote, "The issue of civility, the principle of civility and respect for minority participation in this House is something that we  promised the American people. It is the right thing to do. And I set forth, over a number of years now, principles and respect for minority rights. And we intend to implement them."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This statement was made almost a year ago at a press conference on November 20, 2006. Now, let's contrast those statements that were made and with what took place last night in the Rules Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seven Republican amendments were offered to the bill that we are about to debate, none made in order, including a bipartisan amendment offered by Mr. Garrett of New Jersey; 13 Democrat amendments were made in order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the last time the flood insurance bill was on the floor of the House, which was in the 109th Congress, six Democrat amendments were made in order, one bipartisan amendment was made in order, and nine Republican amendments were made in order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And if this isn't bad enough that the Republicans were denied any amendments in the bill that we have before us today, the majority also, in its rule, has waived the earmark reform rule again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, yesterday when we had the SCHIP bill on the floor, there were earmarks in the bill. They weren't disclosed, they weren't outlined, and there was no way for Members to get at a debate or an amendment on those earmarks that were in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What assurances do American taxpayers have that there isn't some earmark in this bill that we have today? Because there is no list. But yet, the Rules Committee felt obliged to waive the earmark reform bill that was put in place earlier this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the problem we have with the underlying rule is really part of the bigger problem. Last night, our Rules Committee Republicans put together a report outlining the number of closed rules that we have had in this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was here in the early 1990s demanding that the minority ought to be treated more fairly. And clearly, when Republicans took majority control of this House, it may not have been everything everybody wanted, but there was more democracy in the House than what we have seen this year. And I just want to implore all of my colleagues that the American people sent us here to work together to solve the problems of this country. And yet, all year, as I have put my hand out to try to find a way to work  in a bipartisan manner, it gets slapped away. That is not what the American people want of us. It is not what they deserve. And I would ask my colleagues to understand, many of you were here in the minority; you know exactly what I am talking about. It is time to be treating the minority the way you asked to be treated when you were in the minority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask my colleagues to defeat this rule, send it back to the committee, and let's do this in the fair, bipartisan way that the American people expect.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400663" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to point out, Mr. Speaker, the earmark rule is not waived in this rule despite the claims of my colleagues. I urge them to read page 2, lines 6 and 7, that the earmark rule specifically excludes the earmark rule from the waiver. Any suggestion otherwise is simply untrue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the Rules Committee took testimony yesterday on this bill. Unfortunately, some of the Members who spoke today didn't even come to testify on their amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill takes the National Flood Insurance Program in a positive direction. This bill takes important steps to modernize the flood insurance program. This bill has bipartisan support. It raises maximum coverage limits to keep up with inflation; it provides new coverage for living expenses if you have to vacate your home; and, moving forward, Congress is making the flood insurance program sustainable in the long run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, these are all positive steps that allow the program to continue to provide peace of mind to those impacted when a flood event occurs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge a "yes" vote on the previous question and on the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The material previously referred to by Mr. Sessions is as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amendment to <bill type="hr" number="683">H. Res. 683</bill> Offered by Mr. Sessions of Texas</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of the resolution, add the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sec. 3. That immediately upon the adoption of this resolution the House shall, without intervention of any point of order, consider the resolution (<bill type="hr" number="479">H. Res. 479</bill>) to amend the Rules of the House of Representatives to provide for enforcement of clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives. The resolution shall be considered as read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the resolution to final adoption without intervening motion or demand for division  of the question except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Rules; and (2) one motion to recommit.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means</narrative>
  <narrative>This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Democratic majority agenda and a vote to allow the opposition, at least for the moment, to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of Representatives, (VI, 308-311) describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as "a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge." To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that "the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the  previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition" in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry,</narrative>
  <narrative>Because the vote today may look bad for the Democratic majority they will say "the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution ..... [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever." But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the definition of the previous question used in the Floor Procedures Manual published by the Rules Committee in the 109th Congress, (page 56). Here's how the Rules  Committee described the rule using information from Congressional Quarterly's "American Congressional Dictionary": "If the previous question is defeated, control of debate shifts to the leading opposition member (usually the minority Floor Manager) who then manages an hour of debate and may offer a germane amendment to the pending business."</narrative>
  <narrative>Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled "Amending Special Rules" states: "a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate." (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to  the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon."</narrative>
  <narrative>Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Democratic majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan.</narrative>
