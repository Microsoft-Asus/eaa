    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tonight I am proud to stand here to speak on behalf of <bill type="s" number="2484">S. 2484</bill>, a bill to rename the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, after my aunt, Eunice Kennedy Shriver.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1962, Mrs. Shriver persuaded her brother, my uncle, President Kennedy, to establish the NICHD to ensure that all children are born healthy, and that they have an equal chance to achieve their full potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since that time, NICHD has been a global leader in producing developments that improve the lives of this world's children. Specifically, research through the NICHD has helped produce results in reducing the rates of sudden infant death syndrome, reducing infant mortality and maternal HIV transmissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My aunt Eunice Shriver has spent her life fighting to deliver the promise of the American dream to each and every child, not only in this country, but around the world. She has never backed down from a challenge. In fact, when she heard from a mother who could not find a camp that would accept their disabled child, Eunice started a camp of her own in her own backyard, a camp for other parents who, like her, were trying to deal with a family member who was mentally retarded. My Aunt Rosemary had  mental retardation, and my Aunt Eunice was inspired because of her experience with my Aunt Rosemary to start the Special Olympics. And I don't think there is anything that has probably had a more profound effect on millions of people's lives in this world than the impact that Special Olympics has had, not</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Special Olympics organization has given athletes and their families the courage to participate in competition while always remembering that success is not measured by how often you win but by how brave you are in the attempt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond providing athletes and their families with new and unique opportunities in competitive sports, the Special Olympics also established the Healthy Athletes Initiative, which increases health care to athletes at events all around the world. During 2006, 600 screening events took place, and 135,000 athletes received a screening. These screenings provided not only critical care to athletes; they also provided appropriate treatment, and also an opportunity for those athletes to get the rewards  of getting the best in treatment that are too often taken for granted by the rest of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to that, the data from these screenings are collected and used  to promote health policies that inform those of us here in Congress on how we can better develop programs here in Congress for those individuals with intellectual disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The incalculable benefits resulting from this program are just a small example of how my Aunt Eunice has altered the future of millions of children in our own country and around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to say once more, in a personal sense, that she has done so much to destigmatize the stigma of those with mental retardation. And, as someone who is fighting for parity for mental health coverage, she has also worked so hard to destigmatize mental illness, something that often accompanies those families who are depressed when they find that one of their family members has been struck with mental retardation. She has been someone who has fought for the human spirit and the dignity  of the human person in every sense of the word. And, due to her tireless advocacy, our country has been better off for all of her devotion and work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, it is with my great honor and pleasure that today I was able to join my colleagues in seeing that the National Institutes of Health saw the naming of the National Institutes for Childhood and Development named after Eunice Kennedy Shriver for all of the great work that she has done on behalf of every child born in this country and around the world. Congratulations, Aunt Eunice. It is so well deserved.</paragraph>
