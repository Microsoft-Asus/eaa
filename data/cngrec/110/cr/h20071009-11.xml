    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Representative Jo Ann Davis with whom I served as she served as chairperson and I as ranking member on our subcommittee in Government Reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was always a pleasure to work with her. And while we didn't always agree on every issue that came before us, we always agreed that we would be civil and that we would work in tandem for the best interests of the people of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I'm going to miss her. I extend my personal condolences to her family and would just like for her to know that it was indeed a pleasure working with her.</paragraph>
