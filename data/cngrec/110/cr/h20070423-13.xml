    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in consideration of <bill type="h" number="625">H.R. 625</bill>, which names the postal facility in Baldwin Park, California, after Atanacio Haro-Marin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="625">H.R. 625</bill>, which was introduced by Representative HILDA SOLIS on January 22, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on March 29, 2007 by voice vote. This measure, which has been cosponsored by the 52 members, has the support of the entire California congressional delegation. Army Sergeant Atanacio Haro-Marin, age 27, of Baldwin Park, California, was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 16th Field Artillery Regiment, Fort Hood, Texas. He was killed while manning the checkpoint when his  unit came under attack from gunfire and rocket-propelled grenades south of Balad, Iraq on June 3, 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Marin was born in Momax, Mexico, and lived there with his mother while his father worked in California picking fruit and doing construction jobs to support seven children. The family reunited in Los Angeles when Sergeant Marin was 2, and they later moved to suburban Baldwin Park. He will be remembered as a proud and courageous soldier who was living out a long-held dream of serving in the U.S. military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague for seeking to honor the memory, legacy, and contributions of Atanacio Haro-Marin, and urge swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Atanacio Marin, or as he was better known, Nacho, by his friends, typifies the soldiers that come from California. So many of them are from Los Angeles and surrounding areas, so many have stories like Nacho has: one in which he was born in Mexico; one in which his family came here for a better life; one in which he became integrated with the community that he grew up in; one in which he graduated from Sierra Vista High School and was on the track team and ran in the Los Angeles marathon; one  in which he had a desire to serve his country; one in which he joined the National Guard after completing high school and decided to devote his life to serving the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After his tour with the National Guard ended, Nacho transferred to the regular Army and was assigned to Battery C, 3rd Battalion, 16th Field Artillery Regiment at Fort Hood, Texas. In January, 2 months before reporting for duty in the Middle East, Sergeant Marin was able to spend time with his close-knit family. While he was in Iraq he continued to remain close to his family. He called home often and characteristically sent his mother a Mother's Day card that read, "Don't worry, be happy."  Tragically, those uplifting words were some of his last.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A checkpoint was manned by the sergeant and came under fire on June 3, 2003. Unfortunately, this brave young man did not survive the attack. He was only 27 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The post office we are naming today in Baldwin Park we are naming not just as a tribute to this fine soldier, but as a tribute to those who have gone to serve their country in this war and, like so many others, have an American story.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nacho's American story is the story of California, it is a story of the war that is not often talked on this front, of patriotism, of devotion to family, of devotion to this Nation. And it is so appropriate that we name a post office after this fine young man from California. So I join with the majority in urging its swift passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I had expected that Representative Solis, who is the sponsor of this legislation, would have been here, but maybe she had some difficulty getting back from way out west in California today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of our time and urge passage of this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="625">H.R. 625</bill>.</chair>
