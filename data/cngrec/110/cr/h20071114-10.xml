    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today I rise to urge my colleagues to support a strong reauthorization of the SCHIP program that prevents additional loss of health care access to U.S. citizen children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Medicaid citizenship documentation created by the Deficit Reduction Act has caused citizen children to lose access to health care. Low-income white and black U.S. citizen children, not Latino citizens, are disproportionately affected. Documentation requirements are extremely burdensome to low-income families who often lack the resources to pay for that documentation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Alabama, Kansas and Virginia, Medicaid enrollment declined by a larger percentage among white and black children than among Latino children who were U.S. citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services and the past administrator of CMS concurred that there is no substantial evidence that undocumented immigrants are committing fraud in order to receive Medicaid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Citizenship documentation, as implemented, is a flawed policy based on inaccurate assumptions that adversely affect our children's health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to allow that we enforce a good SCHIP program. Take care of those 10 million children.</paragraph>
