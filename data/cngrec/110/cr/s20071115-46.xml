    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Jeri Lemke for receiving the Supporter of the Year Award from the South Dakota Habitat for Humanity. This is a prestigious award that reflects her hard work and dedication to eliminating poverty around the world. It is also a reflection of the valuable role she has played in giving back to her local community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jeri Lemke with Okiciyapi Tipi Habitat for Humanity has worked to increase Habitat's influence in her local community. She is always available to assist Habitat and provides helpful guidance. Okiciyapi Tipi, of the Eagle Butte community, has been transformed by Jeri and her fine leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to recognize Jeri Lemke and to congratulate her on receiving this well-earned award and wish her continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
