    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am here today with a resolution with my friend, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mario Diaz-Balart), that will help to make America aware of hurricanes and the devastation. This resolution supports the goals and ideals of National Hurricane Preparedness Week. It encourages the staff of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, especially at the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane Center and other appropriate Federal agencies, to continue their  outstanding work to educate people in the United States about hurricane preparedness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also urges the people of the United States to recognize such a week as an opportunity to learn more about the work of the National Hurricane Center to forecast hurricanes and to educate citizens about the potential risks associated with hurricanes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In light of the storms and devastation caused by Katrina and Rita in August and September of 2005, I think it is appropriate that America be aware of the situations with hurricanes, particularly since some 53 percent of all Americans live along the coastal areas of this country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Louisiana for his help. Before I discuss this important issue, I want to thank Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall and their great staffs for allowing this important resolution that has been brought here before you to move forward so quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 402, supporting the goals and ideals of National Hurricane Preparedness Week as established by the National Hurricane Center. Hurricane Preparedness Week began yesterday, May 20, and lasts through May 26 of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next Friday, June 1, marks the beginning of the hurricane season, unfortunately, in the Atlantic and central Pacific Oceans. Hurricane season lasts 6 months, until November 30, and those are 6 months that those of us in Florida pay close attention to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The goal of Hurricane Preparedness Week is to inform the public about hurricane hazards and to provide knowledge that can be used to take action. We have to be ready. This information can be used to save lives and to protect your home and your property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>History has taught us that a lack of hurricane awareness and preparation are common among all major hurricane disasters, but by knowing your vulnerability and what actions you as an individual and family can take, you can reduce the effects of a hurricane disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the biggest lessons learned from the recent wave of hurricanes is that residents should have enough supplies to survive for at least 3 days after the landfall of a hurricane. Oftentimes government and law enforcement personnel are engaged in restoring safety and calming the situation and trying to reach people after a landfall of a hurricane. Ideally residents should have enough food, water and supplies to at least last them 3 days until the authorities can actually get there and lend  a hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Millions of Americans face great risks from tropical storms and hurricanes. More than 50 percent of Americans live along the coast, and millions of tourists visit the oceans and the coasts each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The statistics associated with hurricanes are frankly staggering. An average of 11 tropical storms develop each year over the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. Six of those storms will probably become hurricanes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was the busiest on record, including 28 named storms, 15 hurricanes in which 7 were a Category 3 or higher. As a Coastal State, Floridians are keenly aware of Mother Nature's wrath and fury, especially when it comes to hurricanes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In just 2 short years, eight hurricanes have made landfall in Florida from 2004-2005. They were Charlie, Frances, Ivan, Jeanne, Dennis, Katrina, Wilma and Rita. We have heard and read and had to deal with the consequences of those storms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have learned in the past few years, hurricanes pose serious threats to our country. Unfortunately, massive storms can result in casualties, deaths, and millions of dollars in economic damage and destruction. During hurricanes, homes, businesses and other buildings can be damaged by heavy rain, strong winds, and storm surge. Homes can be flooded. Tornadoes can be spun off, and power can be wiped out for days or weeks and sometimes longer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Experts at NOAA's National Hurricane Center in the National Weather Service agree that it is critical to do a few things: Number one, to determine if you live in a hurricane-prone area. Much of Florida is. Also, know your home's vulnerabilities to storm surge, flooding, wind, and develop a written family disaster plan based on this knowledge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once you determine your vulnerability to a hurricane, the National Hurricane Center recommends that people in hurricane-prone areas, such as Florida, assemble a disaster supply kit before the hurricane season begins. Be ready now; don't wait until the storm is on its way. That includes things like a first aid kit with essential medications, and nonperishable food items such as canned goods; at least 3 gallons of water per person per day for at least 3 to 7 days, and that is crucial. You might  be able to survive without a lot of things, but you cannot survive without clean water. They recommend battery-powered radios and flashlights and extra batteries; and special items, including formula for infants, and medications for elderly or disabled family members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have learned in south Florida, the forecasters, the meteorologists and hurricane specialists at the National Hurricane Center are often the best source of the most valuable information on hurricane preparedness. They spend countless hours providing valuable information and warnings to individuals located in the potential path of a hurricane, and millions of Americans have come to rely on their steady advice and counsel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge all Americans living in hurricane-prone areas to use Hurricane Preparedness Week as an opportunity to learn more about the approaching hurricane season and to be prepared before a hurricane threatens our land. We must all learn from our experiences and be prepared.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Mario Diaz-Balart covered the subject matter of the resolution with a tremendous explanation of why we need to be attentive to National Hurricane Week. This June 1 begins the 2007 hurricane season here in the United States, and I hope that recognition here on the floor today will make people aware throughout this country, particularly the people affected by these hurricanes, aware of the dangers and the need to pay attention to oncoming storms.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), who I served with in the State legislature.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412250" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Melancon) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mario Diaz-Balart) for sponsoring this resolution, which I strongly support. It is a very important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this resolution supporting the goals and ideals of National Hurricane Preparedness Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we approach what is expected to be yet another very active hurricane season, it is imperative that we help raise awareness on the importance of being the best prepared for the worst-case scenario.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How can any of us ever forget the horrific scenes etched into our minds after witnessing the devastation caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita? Nearly 2 years later, the gulf coast region and those affected by these storms are still suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was alarmed when FEMA Director David Paulison testified before the Homeland Security Committee last week and informed us that FEMA's revised national response plan will not be completed until sometime in June.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given that we have already had a named storm before the official beginning of hurricane season, I hope FEMA is working expeditiously to get this plan finalized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we all agree that the response of the State, local and Federal Governments were inadequate, and there is much work to be done. However, disaster readiness should not solely lie on the shoulders of government. I hope that individuals will use this week as a reminder that they, too, must prepare themselves, as Mr. Diaz-Balart said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have urged my constituents to develop family disaster plans and create supply kits. It is also important that they follow local weather forecasts and heed any emergency hurricane warnings they receive. These and other simple steps can help save lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while I'm pleased that we are here today to debate this vitally important issue, I also must express some frustration. Most of our States are plagued with some form of natural disaster. In my State, these menaces have caused the most financially crippling crisis we have been confronted with in years, namely, the unaffordable costs of homeowners' insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Due to the onslaught of hurricanes and tornados in recent years, these rates have doubled or even tripled. This has caused many of my constituents throughout Florida, of course, to leave their homes or risk everything by opting not to get coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there are no overnight solutions to help solve this crisis, I believe that this body can take steps to help encourage citizens in disaster-prone areas to better mitigate their property from their storms. I have introduced <bill type="h" number="913">H.R. 913</bill>, the Hurricane Tornado and Mitigation Investment Act, which would accomplish that goal. I'm proud my good friend from Florida is an original cosponsor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, some Members have raised concerns that this is only a Florida or a coastal State issue. However, I will conclude my remarks with this statistic. For every dollar spent by FEMA for mitigating disasters, about $4 is saved on what would have eventually been spent fixing damage from a storm. That's significant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Taxpayers from every State have contributed billions of dollars spent recovering from the aftermaths of hurricanes such as Katrina and Rita. Encouraging our citizens to safeguard their property will save Americans in every State billions of dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, it would reduce the skyrocketing costs of homeowners' insurance and allow my constituents and constituents all over the country, your constituents, Mr. Speaker, to raise their children in the State that they want to and retire in the State that they want to retire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm seeing some big problems in my State, Mr. Speaker. As I said, people are leaving the State, and it's a real shame. It's a real shame. They can't afford the homeowners' insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor <bill type="h" number="913">H.R. 913</bill> and pray that this hurricane season is not as active as predicted.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="402">H. Res. 402</bill>, a resolution to support the goals and ideals of National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I thank my colleague from Florida (Mr. DIAZ-BALART) for his leadership on this issue and for introducing this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, this year the National Hurricane Preparedness Week will be observed from May 20-26, 2007. National Hurricane Preparedness Week is aimed to inform and educate people in the United States about how to prepare for major storms and hurricanes and mitigate the risks to individuals, families, and communities associated with potentially deadly storms. A lack of awareness and preparation by individuals, families, and communities  can contribute to the destructive effects of hurricanes, major storms, and other natural disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Guam know well the devastating effects of major storms. This resolution correctly notes that the Central Pacific hurricane season begins on June 1 and ends November 30. Guam, during that period of time, routinely is hit by powerful typhoons that have winds in excess 150 miles per hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The hazards associated with hurricanes or typhoons and other major storms are not limited to high winds and massive rains. Storm surges, flooding, and the loss of essential services are also among the serious threats to safety, health, and public order associated with such storms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The key to managing the full range of threats is planning and coordination among local, State, and Federal officials. The government and people of Guam are well prepared for these storms and to manage their aftermaths largely as a result of the high level of coordination that exists between local and Federal representatives on Guam. In fact, communities across the United States can learn from the model practiced and utilized by the Government of Guam in order to achieve effective coordination  between local, State, and Federal authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage other at-risk communities across the United States to heed the advice provided by Federal authorities during National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I also encourage at-risk communities to, throughout the year, be vigilant in their efforts to review, revise, and modernize their planning and capabilities to respond to major storms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Planning and preparation is also the responsibility of each family in at-risk communities. Some simple strategies can be followed to help mitigate the risk to individual and families before, during and after major storms. They are: development of a family plan; the creation of a disaster supply kit; the securing of home and property; and the sharing of information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="hr" number="402">H. Res. 402</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="402">H. Res. 402</bill>, which puts this House on record in strong support of the goals and ideals of National Hurricane Preparedness Week. As we near the 2-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, one of the most devastating natural disasters that our country has ever known, we still have a great deal of work to do to secure our Nation from further weather catastrophes. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which  encourages increased public awareness about how to prepare for a hurricane.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Katrina was one of the worst storms in American history, its magnitude rivaled only by the catastrophic failure of the Federal government to adequately respond to the resulting suffering in a manner befitting our great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year's hurricane season officially begins on June 1, and scientific predictions do not bode well. Forecasters anticipate a "very active" year for storms along the Atlantic coastline, with researchers at Colorado State University anticipating 17 named storms, including 9 hurricanes. According to these predictions, there is a 74 percent chance that at least one major hurricane will strike the U.S. coastline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This time we have fair warning. We know how devastating a hurricane can be, and we know we are likely to see another storm of the magnitude of Hurricane Katrina. We know that our disaster prevention, preparedness, and relief mechanisms and agencies are woefully inadequate. We can no longer use ignorance as an excuse, and we cannot allow ourselves to be caught unprepared once again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation recognizes the extreme destructive power of hurricanes; their potential to destroy homes and livelihoods as well as essential infrastructure. We may not be able to predict exactly how, when, or where a hurricane will make landfall, but we do know what areas of the country are particularly vulnerable to hurricanes. We know what basic steps, such as developing a written family disaster plan or establishing evacuation routes, residents of these areas can and should take to prepare  themselves. And most of all, we know that hurricanes will continue to pose a threat in the years to come, a threat which we cannot ignore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recognition of this knowledge, this bill acknowledges this week, May 20-26, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. It encourages the staff of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, especially at the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane Center, and other appropriate Federal agencies, to continue to educate people in the United States about hurricane preparedness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, this legislation urges the people of the United States to recognize such a week as an opportunity to learn more about the work of the National Hurricane Center in forecasting hurricanes and in educating citizens about the potential risks associated with hurricanes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for $81.2 billion in damage, as well as for the deaths of 1,836 persons. We have a responsibility to provide the American people with a disaster preparedness system that works. We must ensure that, should another storm of Katrina's magnitude make landfall on America's coastline, we will not have to witness the atrocious suffering that we saw in the  summer of 2005. I strongly support this legislation, and  I urge my colleagues to do so as well.</paragraph>
