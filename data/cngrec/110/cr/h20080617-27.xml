    <paragraph>How did you count? You said a sufficient number having arisen. I only see four Members in here, and I only saw one rise.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair's count is not subject to appeal.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Okay. Well, all right. But further parliamentary inquiry. If there's four of us in here, and one stands up, is that, in the Chair's opinion, enough to call for a vote?</paragraph>
