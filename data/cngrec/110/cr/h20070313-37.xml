    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on <bill type="h" number="430">H.R. 430</bill>.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Iowa?</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a quote from Chief Justice John Marshall was recently used at St. John's Law School, Judge Duberstein's alma mater, to describe Judge Duberstein: "Once in a while a man mounts the bench with the salt of like, the spice of wisdom, and the sweetness of humor blended in him so subtly and yet so successfully that those who are quite unlearned in the law glimpse some of its beauties." This quote so aptly describes Judge Duberstein.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Duberstein was a proud product of New York. He attended school in the Bronx, college in Brooklyn, and received his law degree from St. John's University Law School. His high school alma mater is also the alma mater of former Secretary of State Colin Powell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The words wisdom, fairness, beloved mentor, humor, humility, and humanity are used not only to describe his life but also reflects the principles he brought to his law practice. He was a judge guided by a sense of fairness and perpetual desire for nothing but justice for all who were in his courts. His accomplishments were without bounds. Judge Duberstein practiced bankruptcy law for over six decades, and when he died in his 90s, he was the oldest surviving bankruptcy judge in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Designating the courthouse in his honor is a most fitting tribute to the extraordinary life and work of Judge Conrad B. Duberstein.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support <bill type="h" number="430">H.R. 430</bill> and urge its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in addition to what the gentleman from Iowa pointed out, Judge Duberstein's tremendous contributions in law, I might also add to that, Judge Duberstein served in the United States Army. We have actually named a few courthouses over the last couple of months after individuals who are World War II veterans, and they are all just outstanding individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Duberstein did serve in the Army during World War II, and he was awarded the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, and the Combat Infantry Badge. After the war he engaged in the private practice of law, where, again, his prominence as a bankruptcy attorney grew large.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from Iowa pointed out his many contributions to law and obviously to the State of New York. This is another bill, Mr. Speaker, where I think it is a fitting tribute, to say the least, and I wholeheartedly support this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of <bill type="h" number="430">H.R. 430</bill> to a person very deserving.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="430">H.R. 430</bill>, a bill introduced by the gentleman from Brooklyn, New York (Mr. Towns), to designate the United States Bankruptcy Courthouse located at 271 Cadman Plaza in Brooklyn, New York, as the "Conrad B. Duberstein United States Bankruptcy Courthouse".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has the unanimous support of the judges of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York. At the time of his death, on November 18, 2005, at the age of 90, Judge Duberstein was the oldest serving Chief Bankruptcy Judge in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Duberstein is a native New Yorker, born in the Bronx in 1915. He was 17 years old when his father died. As a result, he dropped out of school to support his mother and two sisters. In 1934, he received his high school diploma from the Morris Evening High School. In 1938, he graduated from Brooklyn College and, in 1942, he received his law degree from St. John's University Law School. While a law student, he served on the St. John's University Law Review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Duberstein was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1942. In the same year, he took the oath for admission to practice before the United States District Court for the Eastern District in the very building which today we designate in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Duberstein was drafted and served with distinction in World War II from 1943 until 1946. He was stationed in Northern Italy, where he was wounded. He was awarded the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, and the Combat Infantry Badge. While in Italy, he had the honor of being granted an audience with Pope Pius XII.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1981, he was appointed to the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District in New York. In 1984, the Board of Judges appointed him as the Chief Judge. His work was noted for its thoroughness, extensive analysis, and scholarly approach. He was a person known by his humility and humanity. He worked tirelessly to enable persons of every faith, race, and origin to achieve a "fresh start," consistent with bankruptcy laws. He was beloved and revered by his colleagues. It is both fitting and proper  that the bankruptcy courthouse in Brooklyn, New York, be designated in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the bill and urge its passage.</paragraph>
