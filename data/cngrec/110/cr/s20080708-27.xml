  <speaking speaker="300030" topic="TRIBUTE TO BARBARA MORGAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am proud to announce the return of NASA mission specialist, teacher in space Barbara Morgan, not to Earth--that was 10 months ago--but to Idaho and Boise State University where she has been hired in a newly created position that will develop education initiatives in science, math, engineering, and technology. Barbara flew on the Shuttle Endeavor, Mission STS-118, from August 8-21, 2007. She served as a mission specialist onboard Endeavor, working  as a robotic arm operator in the  International Space Station assembly mission and conducting a teaching lesson from space, of which I was fortunate enough to be a part on the ground in Boise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barbara is a teacher by training. In 1985, she was selected to be the backup candidate for the NASA Teacher in Space Program, and trained with the late Christa McAuliffe for 4 months. After the shuttle tragedy in 1986, she returned to Idaho and taught second and third grades at McCall-Donnelly Elementary School. She continued to work with NASA's Education Division as the space designee, speaking publicly, designing curriculum, serving on the National Science Foundation's Federal Task Force for  Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering, and as an education consultant. In 1998, NASA began the Astronaut Educator Program which replaced its Teacher in Space Program and Barbara was selected to train as a mission specialist. She began her 2-year training period that year and, upon completion in 2000, was given technical duties with NASA. She continued her duties and ongoing training in preparation for Mission STS-118 last summer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a preflight interview before STS-118, Barbara's extraordinary commitment to learning was revealed as she recounted of the beginning of her pilot training. She came to flight training with no flying background, and her initial pilot training experience was in a Cessna. Being unfamiliar with the communication language between pilots and air traffic controllers, she went to Radio Shack and bought a radio that gave her access to air traffic control so she could listen and become familiar with  the language. In the course of that interview, one of Barbara's insights about the basics of learning, be it in a career or in school, revealed itself in a fine point about the importance of "learning the language." She observed that once you master the "language," be it an actual language or a set of terms used in a particular vocation or field of study, things become much easier. She understands very well that learning the "language" is the pathway to success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barbara has learned many languages, from that of an elementary school teacher to that of a pilot and NASA astronaut. Boise State University is very fortunate that she will be bringing her science, math, and engineering language skills to its students. It has been an honor for me to pay tribute to Barbara's remarkable achievements today and in the past, and I am certain that there will be many more to come. I offer her, Clay, and their children my heartfelt congratulations and an enthusiastic</paragraph>
