  <speaking speaker="300014" topic="">
    <paragraph>First of all, I hope the American people are watching the debate and paying close attention to it. This debate is not just an important lesson in civics and civility, it is a debate that goes back to the days of our Founding Fathers. The Founding Fathers created the Senate to be a body of unlimited debate. This institution was created to be a deliberative body. It was not created for speed or for quick action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to remind my friend, the majority leader, whom I wish were on the floor, that the Senate is not the House of Representatives. The majority leader and I both served in the House of Representatives. Unlike the House, however, we do not have a rules committee in the Senate that sets the rules for floor debate. Any Senator can come to the floor seeking recognition to speak and offer amendments. In the House, the majority can roll the minority through the Rules Committee. This cannot  be done in the Senate. The minority party cannot be ignored. Yet our friends on the other side of the aisle are trying to dictate the terms not only of the debate on Iraq and the resolutions concerning them, they are telling 49 Republicans in the Senate how business will be conducted in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to be very clear that I would vote in opposition to the Warner resolution. Nonbinding resolutions that question military decisions made by our Commander in Chief and top military generals are not in the best interests of our Nation. But I do support the right of Senator Warner to get an up-or-down vote on his resolution, even though I would oppose it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this week, we had a vote to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed with the Warner resolution. Forty-seven Republicans voted against the motion because we believe we should have more debate, not less, and the ability to offer other resolutions. Yet many of my friends on the other side of the aisle accuse my Republican colleagues of not wanting to debate this issue and not wanting to vote on the Warner resolution. And, not surprisingly, the media is regurgitating the talking points from  the other side of the aisle. But nothing could be further from the truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Warner, the author of the resolution favored overwhelmingly by the Democrats, voted against invoking cloture on his own resolution because he believes in Republicans keeping their rights as Senators. We want a fair debate, not a one-sided conversation. We are asking for more debate, not less, like many on the other side of the aisle suggest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our request is a simple one. If we are going to vote on the Warner resolution, those of us who oppose this resolution should at least be allowed to offer our own resolution, and the senior Senator from New Hampshire offered his resolution concerning funding for the war in Iraq. Some have said his resolution is incorporated in the Warner resolution, but they are missing two key points. The Gregg resolution expresses our full support of our troops and not support that is just cloaked behind other  language that criticizes their mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friend, my good friend, General Petraeus, whom the Senate unanimously confirmed, said in his confirmation hearing that a resolution condemning the President's new Iraq strategy would have a detrimental effect on troop morale. It must be our top priority to assure American  troops that we will not cut off their funding midmission. We already are cutting some of their funds, as seen in this year's continuing resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find it ironic that some of the same Senators who have been on the Senate  floor assuring their full support for the troops are the same individuals who are cutting their funding behind closed doors. I am talking about the funding for the Base Realignment and Construction Program. This is a program that, by law, we have to complete in 6 years. Yet my friends across the aisle have decided not to fund this program because it is not a priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, it is a priority for me. By doing this, they will cause a delay for up to 1 year for military base construction. Because of this, and I ask my good friend, the Senator from Texas, what happens to the 12,000 troops that will not be able to be redeployed back home from Iraq or from Germany or from around the world?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Kentucky asking the question, and I will read a letter signed by all four of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, dated last November, where they are asking that we pass a short-term CR rather than a complete year's CR because they are so concerned about that very issue. They say in their letter:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As required by law, we are executing thousands of interrelated moves to implement all the base realignment and closure projects by September 2011 and to reposition our forces under the Global Defense Posture review. Disruptions in resources will cause delays and desynchronize these moves. This, in turn, can disrupt our force generation and deployment schedules, which ultimately degrades readiness while increasing the burden on servicemembers and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we know now from their own reports, I would say to the Senator from Kentucky, that 12,000 of those who are scheduled to be coming home just this year are going to be delayed, which is going to cause a domino effect all the way down the line. It is incomprehensible that we have this opportunity, but we are not able to go forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator from Kentucky for asking the question.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300014" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, to say that I find this disappointing is quite an understatement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the majority leader to allow us to have a full and fair debate on the CR and allow us to offer amendments. We should be able to debate and vote on the Gregg resolution. This is a resolution that does not play into our enemies' hands. General Petraeus commented that a commander needs to show the enemy that there is no hope of victory. The Gregg resolution does this. It expresses our absolute support for our Commander in Chief and our men and women in Iraq, instead of showing that the will  of the American people has been stripped by opportunistic terrorists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, for Republicans, this is not about a Senate procedural process but about the priorities of the American people. Our Republican leader, my colleague from Kentucky, has tried all week to negotiate to get a vote on the Gregg resolution, in conjunction with the other resolution, the Warner resolution. I appreciate Senator McConnell's efforts, but the majority leader, and many on both sides of the aisle, do not want the vote on the Gregg resolution. Instead, they claim that  Republicans do not want to debate the war in Iraq. This is completely false. The American people need to know that, and the media needs to report the truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one Republican, not one to whom I have spoken, is running from this debate. We want to debate the war in Iraq. Many of us oppose the Warner resolution. It is nonbinding. It sends the wrong message to our enemies and our allies. It will not end the war in Iraq, and it will not bring peace to the Middle East. But we should vote on it, and we should vote on the Gregg resolution because even though the Gregg resolution is nonbinding, it actually relates to the proper role of the Congress with  respect to war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Essentially, the Gregg resolution says that Congress will not vote to defund the war when we have troops in harm's way. This is the proper role of Congress. It does not deter from the Commander in Chief. We don't dictate military strategy, but we do have the power of the purse. We can either fund the war or not fund the war. I am not a lawyer, thank God, but I have spent over two decades in Congress, in both the House and the Senate. And I know the proper role of the legislative branch. I know  the rules of the House, and I know the rules of the Senate. I also know the importance of not sending the wrong message to our troops in the field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have voted to send my own son into war. That was the gulf war. I know the stakes are very high. I know this is an issue that is on every American's mind. But I resent my colleagues on the other side of the aisle saying that Republicans are running from this debate. We are not. I hope today that we can remind my colleagues that this is the U.S. Senate, and the minority has its say. We should vote both on the Warner resolution and the Gregg resolution and we should also vote to  have amendments to the CR and be able to address the BRAC problem that we face and what will happen if they reduce this by $3.2 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have an editorial of the New York Times I will submit for the Record at this time. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record, and I yield to my good friend from Texas.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <chair> The Senator from Texas.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will yield up to 15 minutes to Senator Roberts, after which I will yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Georgia, Senator Chambliss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to send my remarks to the desk and ask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record after Senator Chambliss has spoken. I will need to follow him in that order. I ask unanimous consent my remarks be printed in the Record after Senator Chambliss.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the sequence of speakers?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300076" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object. I ask to amend the request of the Senator to limit each Senator to 15 minutes apiece, under her order. But I also request Senator Kennedy be inserted after your first two speakers, so the order I believe--your first two speakers were?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Senator Roberts and Senator Chambliss.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300076" topic="">
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent Senator Kennedy be allowed 15 minutes after Senator Chambliss.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Texas is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Senator Inhofe has been here for several hours as well. He has been waiting patiently, as has Senator Shelby. I ask if it would be possible to allow the people who are on the floor to be put in an order. If Senator Kennedy would be able to then come after Senator Roberts, Senator Chambliss, Senator Shelby, and Senator Inhofe?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300076" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, again reserving the right to object, what we do on the floor is allow Senators to go back and forth. Senator Kennedy has also been waiting. He is not on the floor, but he has been waiting his turn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I again ask if the Senator will allow us to go ahead and let your two Republican Senators speak, then allow Senator Kennedy to speak, and then go back to your side of the aisle?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Texas?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, at this point I think I will keep the floor and yield to Senator Roberts for 15 minutes and let me talk to Senator Murray. I wish to try to accommodate Senator Murray, but I will not do that at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield up to 15 minutes to Senator Roberts.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300076" topic="">
    <paragraph>Parliamentary inquiry: I assume the Senator from Texas can only yield for a question at this time; is that not correct?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Will the Senator from Texas withhold for a second. It takes unanimous consent to yield for more than a question.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Washington asked for me to yield to her for a question, and I will yield to her for a question.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Washington.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300076" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, at this time I will object. I will suggest the absence of a quorum--</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> Objection is heard. The Senator from Texas.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from Kansas for a question at this time. For a question only.</paragraph>
