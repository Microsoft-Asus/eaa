    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.</paragraph>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412206" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in the consideration of <bill type="hr" number="886">H. Res. 886</bill>, as amended, which expresses sympathy to the victims and families of the tragic acts of violence in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Arvada, Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Resolution 886 was introduced by Representative Doug Lamborn from the State of Colorado on December 18,  2007, and has the support and cosponsorship of over 50 Members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure was considered by the Oversight panel on March 13, 2008, and was passed by voice vote after having been amended for technical purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was only a few short months ago when our country was riveted by the violent rampage of one individual that left five people seriously wounded while killing four others. It was a solemn Sunday in December, December 9, to be exact, when the lives of Judy Purcell, Larry Bourbannais, Tiffany Johnson, Philip Crouse, Dan Griebenow, Charlie Blanch and Stephanie, David, and Rachel Works would be forever changed by a series of tragic events that gripped central Colorado but touched our entire country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the persons impacted by the shooting rampage of a disturbed man were young people who had already chosen honorable and noble paths of service and faith. In remembering that dreadful day, I must also mention the heroic actions of Jeanne Assam, a volunteer security guard, whose swift response led to the wounding and killing of the assailant. We thank her for her dutiful service that helped prevent an already disastrous event from escalating further.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passage of this measure will allow our body an opportunity to officially express our heartfelt condolences, prayers and sympathies to the families and victims of the tragic acts of violence that took place in Colorado Springs and Arvada, Colorado, last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore I urge adoption of House Resolution 886, as amended, and reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>

  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to urge passage of this resolution recognizing the tragedy that befell the communities of Colorado Springs and Arvada, Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this resolution seeks to take a moment to reflect on the impact one man's senseless acts of violence can have on a community, a State and a Nation. On an early Sunday morning, a man entered the New Life Church and proceeded to open fire. Tragically, the lives of Tiffany Johnson and Philip Crouse were taken. They were both staff members of the Youth With A Mission Center, which educates individuals to be evangelical missionaries overseas. Two other staff members were seriously injured  as well, Dan Griebenow and Charlie Blanch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This a place of peace where dedicated young men and women are educated to be Christian missionaries. What happened there on that cold Sunday morning was a true travesty for those victims and the community that surrounds them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later that afternoon at approximately 1 p.m., the same individual who opened fire at the Youth With A Mission facility entered the grounds of the New Life Christian Church and fatally shot two teenagers, Stephanie and Rachel Works. The shooter also shot and seriously injured their father, David Works, in the parking lot before he proceeded into the church. Two others, Judy Purcell and Larry Bourbannais, were also injured that day. Fortunately for the communities of Colorado Springs and Arvada,  Jeanne Assam, a volunteer private security guard, performed heroically that afternoon and engaged the shooter when he entered the church's east entrance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jeanne Assam was a former Minneapolis police officer and was licensed to carry a firearm. She used her education and performed admirably to protect not only those inside the church, but those in the surrounding area as well. She was able to slow the gunman down, which ultimately led to the gunman taking his own life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One shudders to think of the terror that could have ensued had the shooter been able to continue unabated. The shooter was later identified as 24-year-old Matthew Murray. There is only one word that can describe the acts of Jeanne Assam on that day--heroic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The quick response by the security team at New Life Christian Church, who quickly moved to step up security after hearing the news of the initial shooting in Arvada also deserves praise. In addition, we must take a moment to thank the first responders on that day. The El Paso County Sheriff's Office, the Colorado Springs Police Department, the Colorado Springs Fire Department, the Colorado Springs SWAT team, Federal authorities, and medical professionals all played a role in quelling what could  have been an even larger massacre.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this important remembrance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412206" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter) for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412192" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and also the gentlewoman for her kind remarks concerning this day of tragedy in Colorado. We have had a couple of those, Columbine, 9 years ago this week, as well as this tragedy that occurred on December 9.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness and regret that I rise today to honor and pay tribute to the victims and families of the tragic acts of violence that occurred on December 9 at the New Life Church in Colorado Springs and on the Faith Bible Chapel campus in Arvada, Colorado, with this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The senseless acts of violence partially took place in my district at the Youth With A Mission, YWAM, in the heart of Jefferson County in a community still reeling from the tragic events of Columbine several years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Faith Bible Chapel campus is about a block from where my father-in-law lives. It is a place I drive by almost every weekend when I am home. And it is a place in the late hours of December 8 and the early hours of December 9, a reverse 911 call had to go out to the entire neighborhood to advise them of the killings that had gone on so nearby.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All four young men and women lost their lives before the psychotic young gunman turned the gun on himself. This resolution seeks to honor the memory of these individuals: Tiffany Johnson, who was 26 years old; Philip Crouse, 24; Stephanie Works and Rachel Works who I believe were nieces of a friend of mine, John Works, who was a candidate several years ago for the 7th Congressional District of Colorado, which is the seat that I now hold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also seeks to recognize the survivors and the families victimized, and in particular, Dan Griebenow, Charlie Blanch, David Works, Judy Purcell, and Larry Bourbannais who were wounded during this senseless day of killing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that this resolution commends the heroism of the local first responders and law enforcement officials in the city of Arvada, Jefferson County, Colorado Springs, and El Paso County who responded quickly and professionally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Especially, Jeanne Assam, a volunteer private security guard, who courageously rushed into harm's way and used her own gun to stop the shooter, thereby saving the lives of several other bystanders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will never know what was going through the mind of Matthew Murray, the young man who killed these people and wounded several more. We don't know what possessed his mind to take these senseless acts, but we do know that the people who were killed here in this particular incident and the people who were wounded will always stay in our memory and will be honored by this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation can never adequately come to grips with senseless tragedies like these. Whether it is some kind of care for the perpetrator in this instance from his psychosis, or whether it is additional protections that we might give to our churches and our schools, there are many things that we can do, but it is just a shame that sometimes, we can't understand the demons that possess people and cause them to come up with acts of psychotic violence like we have seen here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that this bill sends a message to the victims of these tragic events that they will continue to remain in the thoughts of our Nation, and they will never be forgotten for the events that occurred on December 9. This bill represents one small step in the process of healing for our communities affected by this tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I wish to thank each of my colleagues in the Colorado delegation, and especially Representative Doug Lamborn, who represents the city of Colorado Springs. I want to thank each of the 51 co-sponsors who join me today in expressing sympathy  to the victims and families of the heartbreaking acts of violence in Colorado Springs and Arvada, Colorado, with this resolution, <bill type="hr" number="886">H. Res. 886</bill>. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor  of <bill type="hr" number="886">H. Res. 886</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate those who lost their lives in tragic actV violence last year in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Arvada, Colorado. I truly appreciate the support and friendship from the Colorado delegation in supporting this resolution and offering our most sincere condolences to the victims and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 9, 2007, a young man targeted two Christian organizations that resulted in the death of four young people, in addition to the shooter. Our hearts go out to the family of Stephanie Works, 18, and Rachel Works, 16, whose lives were tragically ended while at the New Life Church in Colorado Springs. Further loss of life was prevented by the heroic acts of Jeanne Assam, an armed volunteer security guard, whose heroic actions stopped the shooter from inflicting more devastation. Hours earlier  another fatal shooting occurred at a Youth with a Mission Facility in Arvada, Colorado that resulted in the tragic loss of Tiffany Johnson, 26, and Philip Crouse, 24.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The personal devastation inflicted on the families of these victims is unimaginable and has impacted our entire community. We offer this resolution to honor the memory of those who were lost, offer our condolences to the affected families, and recognize the courageous actions of Jeanne Assam in preventing this tragedy from harming more Coloradans. Our hearts go out to the families who still daily suffer from the atrocious attacks and we humbly offer our sympathy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="886">H. Res. 886</bill>, "Expressing sympathy to the victims and families of the tragic acts of violence in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Arvada, Colorado."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This important legislation will honor and memorialize those who were affected by the tragic events in Colorado Springs and Arvada. On that fateful day, a gunman took the lives of five people and wounded 5 more, subsequently taking his own life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The shootings at New Life Church in Colorado Springs and the Youth With a Mission Center in Arvada on December 9, 2007, remind us once again that the wrath of violence can easily destroy the lives of a congregation gathered in a sanctified establishment. As we reflect on the lives that were spared, we duly note the actions of Jeanne Assam. Jeanne Assam, a former police officer and New Life Church member and security guard, is credited with halting the gunman's spree by shooting him. Though her  gunfire did not kill the perpetrator, her act of courage and conviction allowed her to halt the gunman's spree, subsequently preventing the death of more people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The carnage at the Colorado tragedy commands that we here in this body take a stand against senseless acts of violence whether here in our own country or elsewhere around the world. It is long past time for our national community to declare that injuries  inflicted on any member of the community by another simply based on hate or hatred of differences pose a threat to the peace and security of the entire community. For that reason alone, such conduct must be condemned and punished severely, if not prevented altogether. I hope that the incident in Colorado does not reflect a larger problem within our society; however, my optimism is guarded with the reality of an escalating amount of gun violence in schools, malls, and churches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Neither the mind nor the heart can contemplate a cause that could lead a human being to inflict such injury and destruction on fellow human beings. We can never completely understand why these things happen; however, we must persevere through the melancholy. The loss of those lives and innocence is a tragedy which all Americans mourn. In the face of such overwhelming grief, I hope the families and friends of those affected can take comfort in the certain knowledge that unearned suffering is redemptive.  My deepest sympathies are with the victims, their families, and everyone who is affected by this tragic situation. This devastation reaffirms why we, as public officials, must take steps to ensure that the United States is a safer environment where acts of violence based on hate are not tolerated. We cannot sufficiently articulate the feelings of sorrow that are universally felt. I extend my prayers and support to the bereaved families during this time of mourning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation, and, in-so-doing, showing respect for the lives that were lost, sacrificed, and spared.</paragraph>
