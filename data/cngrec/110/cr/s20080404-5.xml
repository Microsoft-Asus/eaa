  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are going to resume consideration of the housing legislation. There will be 2 minutes for debate equally divided between the proponents and opponents of the amendments. The Senate will proceed to vote in relation to the Voinovich amendment, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Landrieu amendment. I have been told those two amendments will be modified. I think they will be approved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say to all Members of the Senate, I have spoken to the Republican leader. We have a cloture motion ready to file sometime this afternoon. If we can, we will come up with a consent agreement that we can have a time for final passage on this bill on Tuesday. Before doing that, we would have to know what amendments are going to be offered. We would have to have a finite list of amendments so we knew that. We will all be in communication with the Republican leader. We will either go cloture  or we will go with a consent agreement to finish on Tuesday. There has been a good debate on this bill. There will be managers available all afternoon to offer amendments that Senators want to offer. We will be available here on Monday. People can offer amendments. So there is plenty of time to offer amendments on this bill.</paragraph>
