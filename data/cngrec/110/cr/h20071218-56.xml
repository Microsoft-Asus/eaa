  <speaking speaker="400215" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to stand with my colleagues to honor a truly remarkable Member of Congress, my friend, JULIA CARSON.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a lot of people in Washington, D.C., that sometimes forget their roots or why they want to be  here; not JULIA CARSON. JULIA never forgot why she was here or who she represented. She was here to expand the opportunities for others, to end inequalities in our society, and to seek justice for every American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of her most significant and meaningful accomplishments in the House was her effort to honor Rosa Parks with a Congressional Gold Medal. In the remarks that JULIA delivered when she introduced this bill, she said, "the quiet courage of Rosa Parks changed the course of American history."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those of us who knew and worked with JULIA, we knew that she was not always quiet, but that the course of American history has always been changed by her courage. One of JULIA's greatest attributes was that it didn't matter who you were or where you came from or the color of your skin or the money in your pocket. She was happy to work with anyone who shared her commitment to treating everyone with respect and dignity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her relationship with a good friend of hers, Alan Hogan, comes to mind. Somehow, at age 17, a suburban boy from southeastern Indiana found a mentor in Ms. JULIA. Their mutual affection for each other and their work to promote justice and equality resonated with Alan and turned into a lifelong friendship. Her actions inspired Alan to fight to end social injustices, including working to ensure that young African American athletes were not exploited for their talents and that they received  quality education when recruited to top-notch colleges and universities for their athletic scholarships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. JULIA affected Alan's life in a profound way, and I know she has uplifted countless others that I cannot begin to list here tonight. While she may have had many pieces of legislation that she could acknowledge as great accomplishments, I see an army of volunteers, like Alan, who will continue to carry her work as the greatest of her legacies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JULIA's humanity always pierced through people's preconceived notions of what kind of stereotype she should fit into. You could never pigeonhole JULIA CARSON or predict what she could do or what she would say next. And it often left all of us at the edge of our seat, trying to predict what she would say next.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JULIA has said that it was Rosa Parks who paved the way for her to come to Congress. I believe that JULIA's work as a representative has paved the way and opened the doors for countless young Americans who I hope will follow in her footsteps and achieve great things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Ms. JULIA CARSON, for your friendship and for your legacy of justice and equality for all. We love you, and we will always miss you.</paragraph>
