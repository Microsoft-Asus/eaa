  <narrative>THE ECONOMY -- (Senate - November 20, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10707">S10707</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today there has been much discussion once again here on the floor of the Senate and certainly in the news and in various other venues, I am sure at the Secretary of the Treasury's office, about the economy and what is happening in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One only has to look at the stock market--today it moved down very quickly and very aggressively once again; it has happened many times in recent days. There are very serious problems. But it is not just the stock market that reflects those problems. It is perhaps if you were sitting in a home tonight or last night or last week or last month to hear someone come home from work to stay to the spouse: Honey, I have lost my job. And 1.2 million people did that in the last 10 months, half of them  in the last quarter. There were 240,000 last month who came home and said: I have lost my job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No, not because they are bad workers; because people are being laid off. This economy is in a recession. It appears to be a very deep recession, with a great deal of trouble coming from a range of activities that went way beyond the pale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The subprime loan scandal, an almost unbelievable economy that was providing substantial additional benefits and salaries and bonuses to people at the top of the economic ladder. It is almost unbelievable what has happened with the reckless behavior with respect to some of the financial firms in this country. The result is that the amount of leverage and the development of a house of cards built on an illusion of assets has caused a collapse, and it is affecting virtually every corner of this  country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tonight there are people who will ask the question: What has happened to my retirement account? What about my 401(k) account? What about my individual retirement account? How far has it gone down? How much have I lost? What will it mean to my retirement? How much longer will I have to work?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been on this floor plenty of times talking about what has caused all of this. If you do not think about it and talk about it and take steps to correct it, it will happen again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only way the American people will have confidence about the future is if they believe we are taking steps to correct that which caused this problem. I have talked about the companies that started this mess, the brokers, the mortgage companies, the folks who buy and sell securities, the hedge funds, those who trade in derivatives such as credit default swaps. I have talked about all of them. All of them made massive amounts of money. Do you know the highest income earner in the country last  year earned $3.7 billion? One person. That is $10 million a day. If the spouse said: How did it go today? That person had to say, pretty well, I  made $10 million. That day and every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is unbelievable to me. It is an example of what has been happening at the top. Massive bonuses and salaries; everybody making money hand over fist by creating this financial house of cards. It collapses and injures everybody in this country, and a whole lot of folks are thrown out of work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The source? Subprime loans, companies saying to people: Hey, how about a loan? You do not have to pay even the principal at all. You do not have to pay all of the interest. You have bad credit, you cannot get any credit, you have been bankrupt, you are a slow payer, you do not pay your bills, but it does not matter. Come to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was the advertising. Is it any wonder that all of this collapsed? And as they put all of those bad loans together, they securitized them and chopped them all and sold them as securities. They securitize everything these days. They sold them as securities and moved them around the country and around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of a sudden we have a bunch of firms that decided, hey, these are pretty good-paying securities. They have a big return. We are going to buy some of these. So they bought them all up. And now guess what. They have got all of these rotten assets in their portfolio, and it is pulling them all under and causing a massive problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So here we sit with a collapse of a financial system, names that are household names, the biggest firms in the country going belly up, getting bailed out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Treasury Secretary comes to us and says: I need $700 billion on an emergency basis in 3 days, and if not, the sky is going to fall in. So the Secretary does not get it in 3 days or with a 3-page bill, but he gets it in a couple of weeks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now he has $700 billion, but he does not know what he wants to do it with it. He said: I need it and I need it urgently right now because I want to buy toxic assets and I want to get these toxic assets off the balance sheets of these companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, he got the money. Then he said: You know what, that is not right either. I do not want to buy toxic assets. What I want to do is provide money, capital, to big banks. He takes $125 billion and aimed it at nine banks, some of whom did not want it. The problem was, it was the biggest gift in the world. There were no strings attached. Can you imagine taking $125 billion and saying to nine big banks: You take this money, and, by the way, I will not require you to expand your lending. That is  the reason I am giving it to you, but I will not require it. I will have no prohibition on you using it for bonuses. Go right ahead. And, by the way, my agency is also going to encourage you to merge because we like bigger banks; merging will be beneficial, we are told. Is it any wonder</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I sat with a banker in North Dakota recently at a table. I said to him, a small town banker: Do you have money to lend? I said: They say the credit markets are frozen. Do you have money to lend?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oh, yes, he said. He said: If somebody comes in, I have got money to lend them, because he did business the old-fashioned way. He said: I take deposits and I make loans. But when I make loans, I make sure those to whom I lend the money are going to have a reasonable opportunity and are able to repay the money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is business the old-fashioned way. He said: I did not get involved in all of those reckless practices. I did not buy those securitized notes with subprime loans. I did not do all of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the biggest financial companies in this country did. They were like hogs in a corn crib, buying and selling, making lots of money, everybody is wading in cash. Now they are up to their necks in trouble, and the Treasury Secretary says if we do not bail them out, the whole economy is going to collapse. So this bailout occurs without any conditions at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Did anybody say, with these hundreds of billions of dollars--and by the way, it is not really hundreds of billions. If you take a look at what Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board have done, it is somewhere between $2 and $3 trillion that has been pledged to those big firms. Not many people know that. And you cannot get all of the details. But the Federal Reserve Board opened up its window, first time in history, to say: We will do direct lending with investment banks whose assets are not insured  by the Federal Government. First time in history. So we have around $2 to $3 trillion out there extended on behalf of the American people with some of these companies that were engaged in unbelievably reckless practices and behavior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The issue, it seems to me, is what did the Treasury Secretary require of these companies that got this massive amount of money? What did the Federal Reserve Board require of these companies? The answer is nothing. No restrictions. No restrictions on bonuses. We now read that somewhere around $20 to $30 billion of bonuses will be paid in the next month or two. Any restrictions on parking the corporate jets? No. Any restrictions on income at all? No. No restrictions at all. No strings attached.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there is a great discussion here on the floor of the Senate and in this town about bailing out the automobile industry. That proposal is $25 billion, about 4 percent of the $700 billion. As far as I am concerned, the automobile industry has plenty to answer for. But if we are talking about a potential loss of 3 to 5 million additional jobs if that industry goes belly up, at a time when this economy is in such desperate condition, putting 3 to 5 million additional people out of work would,  I think, be devastating to this economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that is a very important consideration. But I am not about to propose bailing out anybody unless there are tough restrictions and conditions. I know those executives from Detroit got a pretty tough time, and should have, yesterday. They flew here in their private jets, making about $20 million a year, saying: We need help from the American taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Look, if we are going to lose 3 to 5 million jobs, I want to help for a couple of reasons. No. 1, I don't want millions more people out of work that would further jeopardize this economy. No. 2, I want to retain a strong manufacturing base. Part of that is the automobile industry. You don't long remain a strong world economic power unless you have a strong manufacturing base. But I am not about to support a bailout for anybody unless there are strong, tough, and rigorous conditions. Park those  corporate jets, 24 roundtrip flights from Detroit to Washington, DC, and they flew in corporate jets, making $20 million a year, saying: Give us a little help. Where is the self-sacrifice?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not just talking on the part of that industry. They were singled out yesterday, and I am not excusing them. They got what they deserved in the House hearing. But did anybody ask the question, when the Treasury Secretary was ladling money around by the hundreds of billions of dollars or the Federal Reserve Board was ladling money around to the point of $2 to $3 trillion, did anybody say to those biggest financial firms: By the way, here are some restrictions. Maybe you ought to park your  airplanes. Maybe you ought to be concerned about these unbelievable incomes. Talk about $20 million a year for people running an automobile company, we are not talking about $20 million when we talk about some of these hedge funds. We are talking about an average of the top 25 hedge funds, somewhere around $700</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those restrictions ought to be rigorous and tough. There must be independent oversight on anything that is given to that industry, or other industries for that matter. They ought to agree to a prohibition on dividend payments so that money going to those companies isn't going to go out in dividends. That would make no sense. There ought to be prohibited golden parachutes for executives as well as executive bonuses during the duration of  the loan. Again,  I say park those corporate jets. How about announcing that you are willing to take $1 a year for the sake of trying to repair what is wrong with your company and trying to put that company back on track?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand it wasn't their fault that sales dropped 30 percent. They are victims, as are all Americans, of this economic crisis. It is not their fault that sales dropped 30 percent. So if they need some help to save 3 to 5 million jobs, I think most Americans would say: Let's save those jobs. But most Americans would also ask the question: Where is the self-sacrifice on the part of those folks who are running these companies? Let's see a little and let's hear a little self-sacrifice from people  who say: I will own up to this. I will put something significant on the table in terms of trying to turn this economy and these companies we run around.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me finally say, there are a whole lot of folks across the country who are doing business the right way, Main Street businesses, community banks. They come to work in the morning. They turn the key. They open the lock on that door. They are at risk. They are just trying to make a living. Yet they, too, are victims, not because they got engaged in the kind of behavior in which some of the biggest companies in this country were engaged. Some of the biggest financial companies were engaged in  reckless behavior. When the Financial Modernization Act passed the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate nine years ago, an act that was a devastating piece of legislation that led us down this path to a financial collapse, I said back then when I voted</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We knew you shouldn't do that. We learned it in the Great Depression. It caused the closure of massive numbers of banks. Some of my colleagues brought a bill to the Congress and got almost everybody to agree to it that said: These lessons are old-fashioned. Let's let these financial institutions merge and fuse together risky things with banking, securities, and real estate. What an unbelievably ignorant thing to do. We had learned that lesson before and forgot it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Guess what. From that day on we began to see the kind of inherent risk established in financial enterprises that someday most of us believed would create the house of cards that would collapse. And it has. Now the question is, how do we put this back together?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say this: If I didn't have great hope for the future of this country, I would hardly be able to get up and go to work, but I think this is a resilient, wonderful place. We have made very big mistakes. A lot of people have made very big mistakes, perhaps all of us. But this country is a great place. Think about what America has been through: the Civil War, the Great Depression, beating back the forces of fascism and nazism. We have done so much in this country to prevail. This generation  of Americans is not about to lose. This generation of Americans, too, will prevail. But it is going to require all of the effort of every one of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This isn't about politics. It is certainly not about Republicans and Democrats. It is about creating good public policy that gives the American people confidence and hope in the future. That is what will get us out of this rut. Those who caused the financial wreckage, who drove this economy into the ditch, are not going to get us out. It is good public policy by thoughtful people that will begin mirroring what happens on Main Streets and community banks all across the country, doing business  the right way. When that happens, we will put this country back on track. I hope that is sooner rather than later. I hope the American people do not lose hope because we believe, all of us believe, in the great promise of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is true that we face great challenges, but we are turning a page. We will have a new Congress. We will have a new President and a new determination to try to fix what is wrong and put this country on a better path.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
