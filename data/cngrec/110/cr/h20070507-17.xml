    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1595">H.R. 1595</bill>, the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act; and I thank Chairman Nick Rahall and Ranking Member Don Young for their leadership on this issue and their assistance in bringing this bill to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Chairman John Conyers of the House Committee on the Judiciary for their support of this bill and for their assistance in expediting its consideration today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1595">H.R. 1595</bill> implements the recommendations of the Guam War Claims Review Commission, which was authorized by Public Law 107-333 to review the war claims program for Guam, which Congress provided for following the occupation of Guam from December 8, 1941 to July 21, 1944. The review commission, appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, Gale Norton, in September of 2003, was mandated to determine whether there was parity of war claims paid to the residents of Guam under the Guam Meritorious Claims  Act as compared with awards made to similarly affected United States citizens or nationals in territory occupied by the Imperial Japanese military forces during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, the review commission was mandated to advise on any additional compensation that may be necessary to compensate the people of Guam for death, personal injury, forced labor, forced march and internment. In accomplishing its task, the review commission held two days of hearings on Guam in December of 2003 to receive testimony from survivors of the occupation of Guam. The review commission also held hearings here in Washington, D.C. and consulted with a panel of experts in this field of  law. The review commission completed its work and reported to Congress its findings and recommendations on June 9, 2004. The review commission found that there was a lack of parity between the war claims program authorized for Guam versus the programs authorized for all other Americans similarly affected and recommended that Congress remedy this injustice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to quote the first finding of the review commission's report for the benefit of all of my colleagues: "The review commission finds that there is a moral obligation on the part of our national government to pay compensation for war damages in order to ensure to the extent possible that no single individual or group of individuals bears more than a just part of the overall burden of war."</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Today, Mr. Speaker, we consider a bill that would fulfill this moral obligation on the part of our National Government to a group of citizens, the people of Guam, most of whom were indigenous Chamorros, who bore the burden of a brutal occupation. The people of Guam were brutalized through public executions, beheadings, rape and severe injury, forced labor, forced march and internment in concentration camps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1595">H.R. 1595</bill> is called the Loyalty Recognition Act because the loyalty of the people of Guam to the United States during this 32-month enemy occupation should be honored. It is a tragic injustice of history that, following liberation, Congress did not provide for war  claims for the people of Guam in the same manner and with the same opportunities that were afforded to other Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people who carried a disproportionate burden of the war were given less than other Americans when it came time to make our Nation whole, and those who gave more in blood got less in recognition. Over and over at the hearings on Guam, people said, "We just want to be recognized. We just want to be treated with respect. We just want to receive the same restitution that other Americans received."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to acknowledge the excellent work of the Guam War Claims Review Commission chaired by Mauricio Tamargo, with Members Robert Lagomarsino, a former Member of Congress; Ms. Ruth Van Cleve, Director of the Office of Territories in the Department of Interior; former Chief Justice Ben Benjamin J. Cruz of the Guam Supreme Court; and Senator Antonio Unpingco of the Guam legislature. Their report provided the basis for today's bill, and their contributions are greatly appreciated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to acknowledge the efforts of my predecessors to bring the war claims issue to the attention of Congress, beginning with our very first Delegate to Congress, the late Mr. Antonio B. Won Pat, followed by the efforts of our second Delegate to Congress, retired Marine Brigadier General Ben Blaz, who is here with us today on the floor to witness this discussion, and my immediate predecessor, Congressman Robert A. Underwood, whose legislation in the 107th Congress created the review commission.  Our work today, and the historic progress of the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act, is possible only because of the foundation that each of these contributed to this bipartisan effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The issue of Guam war claims has been studied and examined by this body over the past 24 years. Several hearings have been held, and the record is replete with testimony from survivors, legal experts, historians and scholars. Committee staff members have played a valuable role in this process by ensuring the right questions were asked, that Members were briefed, and that the issue was thoroughly examined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Jim Zoia, Staff Director of the Natural Resources Committee, and Tony Babauta, Staff Director of the Insular Affairs Subcommittee. Tony is a Chamorro from Guam, whose insights have been invaluable. I also acknowledge the counsels to the committee, Jeff Petrich, Brian Modeste, Lisa Pittman and Rich Stanton, who have worked very hard on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This afternoon, we stand on the brink of a historic moment for the people of Guam. I regret, Mr. Speaker, that many survivors of the occupation of Guam did not live to see this day, and I fear that some will pass away before this bill completes its legislative journey. But we have this moment to recall why we fight this fight, on whose behalf we are speaking today and why it is so vitally important to our Nation that we recognize the incredible sacrifices of the people of Guam during World War  II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I very much doubt that any foreign power will ever again occupy American soil and place American citizens under subjugation. The story of the people of Guam will thus be a unique story, less known than the bombing of Pearl Harbor and other heroic stories of World War II. It is a story of faith in our Nation, of hope in our God and of love for our families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I could vote, Mr. Speaker, on final passage of this bill, it would be my greatest honor to recognize the people of Guam by voting to pass this bill. But since I cannot vote as a Delegate, I offer all of my colleagues the honor of recognizing their fellow Americans and passing this bill today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless Guam. God bless the United States of America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1595">H.R. 1595</bill>, the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act. I commend my good friend and colleague, the gentlelady from Guam, for introducing this legislation designed to address the lack of parity in the war claims paid to the residents of the people of Guam as compared to other U.S. citizens or nationals who were similarly affected during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, every Guam Delegate to Congress has spoken about the deficiencies in making Guam whole after World War II. Our former colleagues Antonio Won Pat, General Ben Blaz, and former Congressman Robert Underwood had raised the issue throughout their service in the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the efforts of Congressman Robert Underwood, a commission was established in the 107th Congress to review the historical record of addressing Guam's war claims. After completing its work, the Guam War Claims Review Commission found that a lack of parity existed in the case of war claims for the people of Guam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These were some of the key findings of the commission:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That the U.S. has a moral obligation to pay proper compensation for war damages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That there is a lack of parity in war claims for Guam when compared to other war claims programs established by the U.S. Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That Guam was erroneously excluded from coverage under Title II of the War Claims Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is vitally important because it addresses these long-standing inequities against the people of Guam by implementing the recommendations of the Guam War Claims Review Commission. It recognizes the sacrifices made by the people of Guam and their steadfast loyalty to the United States in the face of this adversity. It allows claims for death, personal injury, forced labor, forced marches and internment. It allows compensation to certain survivors of the deceased from the war; and  it authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to award grants in support of activities to remember Guam's occupation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I submit to my colleagues, our Nation committed a grave injustice some 60 years ago against the people of Guam. For some unknown and mysterious reason, Mr. Speaker, the native Guamanians, who are U.S. Nationals, U.S. Nationals, meaning owing permanent allegiance to the United States, were not evacuated along with U.S. citizens at the time that they were living in Guam before the arrival of the Japanese forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, these patriotic Americans were left to fend for themselves, to contend with the Japanese takeover of the territory of Guam, and for nearly 3 years, the people of Guam were interned and were subjected to extreme tortures, even executions by public, beatings, rapes, forced labor, forced marches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A good example is right here in our midst, Mr. Speaker, my good friend and former Member of Congress representing the territory of Guam, retired Brigadier General Ben Blaz, at that time was a youth and was part of this forced evacuation. He personally witnessed some of the atrocities that were committed against his people by Japanese military forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our former colleague, Congressman Bob Underwood, also reiterated to our colleagues that some of his close relatives were beheaded in the presence of other people of Guam when this took place for some 3 years, some 3 years. And I can never forget the words echoed by my good friend, the general from Guam, when he said this, "we are equal in war but not in peace."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why, for the life of me, Mr. Speaker, it has taken all these years in simply trying to make this inequity fair and just for the benefit of the people of Guam I do not understand. It is as if these people were aliens or not members of the American family. We have had Guam for how many years? It was a territory of the United States, and this is what we did against these good people of Guam at the time of the war. Why we never evacuated them along with other U.S. citizens to this day is still a  question. Why the Navy never  took them out of there before the arrival of the Japanese.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appeal to my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, that we pass this bill. It is long overdue. For the sake of justice, pass this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank the good lady from Guam for her leadership and sponsorship of this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it has been said among some of the critics of this legislation, saying that the people of Guam were properly compensated already. I am sure the gentlelady has the correct information so that we can inform our colleagues this is not true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The way the whole thing has been presented, the procedures that were followed and the war claims that were made for the U.S. citizens left out the people of Guam. For some reason or another, I think our colleagues need to understand this a little more clearly.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have a point of order.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman will state his point of order.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, did the gentlelady just not state that she had no more speakers?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is correct. The gentlewoman from Guam nevertheless had time remaining and did not yield it back.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>That was my understanding at the time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I understood that she had not yielded her time. With 7 minutes remaining, I requested that there be a colloquy between myself and the gentlelady from Guam. Is there anything wrong with that?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentlewoman from Guam has 6 minutes remaining.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, in answer to the questions raised, let me just put it this way: There are several categories in the bill to pay for compensation. One is for living survivors of the occupation; $15,000 for rape or severe personal injury, such as loss of limb, dismemberment or paralysis; $12,000 for forced labor or personal injury that is less severe in nature, such as disfigurement, scaring or burns; $10,000 for forced march, internment or hiding to evade  internment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Category two is for death claims, $25,000 to a spouse or children of a Guamanian who died during the occupation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Category three for descendants of deceased survivors; $7,000 to descendants of injured or interned survivors who have passed away, irrespective of the injury or the harm sustained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The total of this legislation, we are asking $126 million for claims and $5 million for grants for the Department of Interior to promote activities related to the occupation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also another question, if I could answer, why is the U.S. paying for this instead of Japan? The United States inherited the obligation of reparations due to the treaty of peace with Japan which ended hostilities with Japan. It is the standard practice that citizens make claims to their own government arising from hostilities. It is the responsibility of the United States to make the people of Guam whole. Guamanians were U.S. nationals at the time of the occupation by Japan.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>I ask the gentlelady, were there any provisions where it required the Japanese Government to restore or to provide some form of compensation as part of this treaty arrangement?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Not to my knowledge. The U.S. inherited this.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>So the Japanese Government just simply said, well, don't ask us; ask the United States Government to provide this.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Due to the treaty of peace.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>So there was never any compensation or any support even from the Japanese Government to make whole what they did against the people, the residents of Guam?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>That is correct. It is the United States responsibility to make Guam whole.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400001" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support legislation that has been introduced by my colleague, Congresswoman BORDALLO. <bill type="h" number="1595">H.R. 1595</bill>, the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act, would honor the residents of Guam for their loyalty and compensate them for the atrocities they suffered during the Japanese occupation of Guam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During World War II, Guam was invaded, seized and occupied by Imperial Japanese forces for nearly three years. The war destroyed much of Guam, including housing, public buildings, utilities and infrastructure. In addition, the people of Guam suffered many deaths and an untold number of acts of brutality. This ruthless brutality has left a lasting impact on the survivors of the war and the descendants of victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1947, the Secretary of the Navy commissioned a civilian committee on the Naval Administration of Guam and American Samoa to prepare a report with specific recommendations. The report became known as the Hopkins Report and was submitted to the Secretary of the Navy in 1947. Among other things, the report addressed deficiencies in the war claims process for Guam immediately after the war ended. In the cover letter submitted with the report, the committee stated, "Only so can justice be done  to a valiant group of Americans who at great cost to themselves remained steadfastly loyal during the war ..... in so special a case this government could well be very generous in method of distributing its relief as well as generous in amount awarded. It has been neither."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many decades later, the 107th Congress authorized the Guam War Claims Review Commission to determine if the people of Guam received parity in claims as compared to other Americans who experienced losses and damages during the war. In 2004, the Commission submitted their final report to Congress and found that Guam's residents were inequitably treated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been legislation to address this inequitable treatment in every Congress since 1985. Two hearings have been held, one in the 108th Congress and one on in the 109th Congress. It is time to follow the recommendations made by both the Hopkins report and the Guam War Claims Review Commission by providing adequate reparations for the people of Guam. It is time to honor them for their sacrifices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman BORDALLO has done a fantastic job over the years to create the most fair and equitable legislation that Congress can pass. I hope the people of Guam know that this issue is being addressed and the people have not been forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the people of Guam and vote for final passage.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise this today in strong support of the passage of <bill type="h" number="1595">H.R. 1595</bill>--the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act. I also commend the gentlelady from Guam for her leadership on this issue. This legislation has bipartisan support and is being considered today because of her determination to seek justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are here this afternoon, taking a significant step forward to close a very painful chapter in Guam's history. From the time that Guam had been granted a delegate to Congress in the 1970's, throughout the service of our former colleagues--Mr. Won Pat, Mr. Blaz, and Mr. Underwood--this House has been made aware and constantly reminded that Guam and her people suffered unimaginable atrocities during its occupation by Japan during World War II. For nearly three years, the idyllic paradise became  a land of panic, horror, suffering, and death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The personal testimonies of survivors of Guam's occupation has a strong history with the Committee on Natural Resources. They are emotional, sad, and graphic. Many of those survivors who appeared before the Committee to re-tell and, in essence, re-live the pain of occupation have since passed on. There are very few of the estimated 22,000 Guamanians alive today who survived this era, and it is my hope that we can give them closure before none remain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There now have been two federally appointed Commissions that have reviewed the implementation and the parity treatment of Guam's experience--the Hopkins Commission in 1947, and the Review Commission in 2004. Both concluded that the people of Guam were either misinformed or mistreated. Either way, their recommendations to Congress--be it in 1947 or in 2004--are that something needs to be done to make this right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The weight of history now falls on the shoulders of this House, nearly sixty-three years  after Guam's liberation. We have the opportunity by passing <bill type="h" number="1595">H.R. 1595</bill> to correct a great injustice for those patriotic Americans who withstood brutal occupation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The issue has been studied to exhaustion and the recommendations have remained the same. We should never forget their sacrifice for our country, nor should we allow for this inequity to continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the passage of <bill type="h" number="1595">H.R. 1595</bill>--the Guam World War II Loyalty Act.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1595">H.R. 1595</bill>, the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act and urge my colleagues to support its passage. I want to begin by commending my colleague and friend from Guam, the Honorable Madeleine Bordallo, for her steadfast and dedicated efforts towards enactment of this bill. Congresswoman Bordallo has been singularly focused--since arriving in the House--on the enactment of legislation to provide compensation for those  of her constituents who suffered unspeakable acts of horror during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the people of Guam who were subject to public executions by beheading, personal injury, forced labor, forced march, rape and internment at the hands of the Japanese, have waited much too long for just compensation. The Guam War Claims Review Commission found that Guam's residents were inequitably treated under the Guam Meritorious Claims Act and subsequent Federal laws meant to address WWII personal injury claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Commission, which was established pursuant to legislation sponored by our former colleague from Guam, Robert Underwood, recommended that Congress enact legislation providing for additional compensation to Guam's residents. Thus the bill we are discussing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The struggle for fair compensation for the people of Guam has been on-going for more than 60 years now. Sadly many of the Chamorros who suffered these atrocities have passed away but we must not let their suffering, largely due to the steadfast loyalty to the United States, be in vain. Passage of <bill type="h" number="1595">H.R. 1595</bill> is long overdue and by doing so today, we will honor their memories and provide compensation to these brave Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of <bill type="h" number="1595">H.R. 1595</bill>.</paragraph>
