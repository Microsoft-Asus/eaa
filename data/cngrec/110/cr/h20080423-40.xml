    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I join with Representative Chet Edwards and his fellow colleagues from the State of Texas in considering <bill type="h" number="3721">H.R. 3721</bill>, which renames the postal facility in Lorena, Texas, after Marine Gunnery Sergeant John D. Fry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As stated, the measure at hand was first introduced by Congressman Chet Edwards on October 2, 2007, and is cosponsored by all members of the Texas congressional delegation. The measure was referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, where it was passed by voice vote on December 12, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3721">H.R. 3721</bill> would help to remember the life, service and legacy of Marine Gunnery Sergeant John D. Fry by renaming the Lorena Post Office on Lorena Road in his honor. Assigned to the 8th Engineer Support Battalion, 2nd Marine Logistics Group from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, Marine Gunnery Sergeant Fry was working to disarm an improvised explosive device in the Anbar Province of Iraq when he was killed at the young age of 28.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A graduate of Waco Christian Academy, Sergeant Fry will always be remembered by his family, friends, fellow marines, and, of course, by his country, for his bravery and unselfish service in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask that we pay tribute to the sacrifice made by this great American hero and pass <bill type="h" number="3721">H.R. 3721</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Marine Gunnery Sergeant John D. Fry was a proud and loyal American who served his country in fighting the war on terror. He made the ultimate sacrifice defending freedom when he lost his life on March 8, 2006, in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only 7 days before returning home to his family, Sergeant Fry volunteered for a mission to defuse bombs along a road in Al Anbar. After successfully defusing three bombs, a fourth, hidden under the third bomb, exploded, ultimately resulting in his death. Sergeant Fry was aware of this incredibly risky procedure, but with his dedication to making a difference in life, he felt it was his duty to undertake this mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was remarkably generous and had a passion for helping others in Iraq, not just fellow marines, but Iraqi citizens as well. Throughout his deployment overseas he disarmed 73 explosives, including one of the biggest car bombs in Fallujah, and saved the life of an Iraqi boy who had been beaten and chained to the wall with explosives strapped to his chest. In this and many other instances, Sergeant Fry proved that he truly could make a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only was Sergeant Fry a hero to his country, but he was a husband, a father and a son. He was proud to serve his Nation, and with gratitude and bravery for his sacrifice, I ask all Members to support <bill type="h" number="3721">H.R. 3721</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure now to yield such time as he may consume to the sponsor of this resolution, the distinguished gentleman from Texas, Representative Chet Edwards.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400118" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking Mr. Davis of Illinois and Mr. Davis of Virginia for their very eloquent comments in respect to a great American who gave his all for the American family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3721">H.R. 3721</bill>, which salutes the service and sacrifice of Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry by naming a Post Office in my district in Lorena, Texas, in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For generations to come, Mr. Speaker, citizens in his hometown of Lorena will be reminded that Sergeant Fry gave, in the words of Lincoln, his "last full measure of devotion" to country. In doing so, Sergeant Fry joined the heroes who, throughout our Nation's history, have given their lives to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John David Fry was born in Lorena, Texas, in 1977. He joined the Marines in 1995 and became an explosive ordnance disposal technician, EOD. As an EOD, he was stationed in Japan from 2002 to 2005 and was deployed to Iraq in September of 2005 with the 8th Engineer Support Battalion, 2nd Marine Logistics Group, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force out of Camp Lejeune.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While in Iraq, Sergeant Fry saved countless lives by rendering safe hundreds of bombs, including one of the largest car bombs found in Fallujah. He once went into a home, as Mr. Davis of Virginia mentioned, to find a bomb strapped to a mentally retarded young Iraqi boy who had been beaten and chained to a wall. Sergeant Fry disarmed the bomb and saved that child's life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Fry turned down a Bronze Star and a ticket out of Iraq after a serious wound. Why did this great American do it? He said because he just wanted to do what he was supposed to do. He was proud to be a marine and proud to be serving his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, sometimes I wonder where we Americans find such magnificent citizens with such spirit and soul.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seven short days before this 28-year-old marine with a wife and young children was to be sent back home, he volunteered, he volunteered when he didn't have to, to defuse one more explosive device, this time in Al Anbar province. Sergeant Fry found three bombs that night and defused all of them. But the insurgents had hidden a fourth bomb under that third bomb. It blew up and killed him. This brave Marine, who had saved hundreds of lives, finally gave his own life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He leaves behind his mother, Beth, his wife Malia, and their three young children, Kathryn, Gideon, and C.L. As the father of two young sons, Mr. Speaker, I would like to say to the Sergeant Fry children that when my two young sons, who are now 10 and 12, grow up some day, if they had a right to be one-tenth of proud as me as these  children have a right to be proud of their father, this great American, I would consider my life a success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Fry earned the Purple Heart and many other decorations for his outstanding military service. With full military honors, he was buried at Rosemound Cemetery in Waco, Texas, on March 23, 2006. I want to thank President Bush for coming to the Veterans Day ceremony this past year in Waco, Texas, to honor the Fry family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Sergeant Fry's final resting place may be in a cemetery in Waco, I have faith that his spirit will touch the lives of others who will be inspired by this young man's devotion to country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John David Fry is an American hero who gave his life defending our country in Iraq. We humbly recognize that we can never fully repay this citizen or his family for their deep loss, but I hope and pray that honoring him in this way here in Congress and at the post office back in his hometown of Lorena will celebrate his dedicated service and always preserve his memory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, with honor and respect to the life of John David Fry, I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="3721">H.R. 3721</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend Representative Edwards for the introduction of this resolution and for his eloquent, passionate statement. I am pleased to join with him in urging passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
