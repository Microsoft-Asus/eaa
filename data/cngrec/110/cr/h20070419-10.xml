  <speaking speaker="412201" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, under Democrat leadership, the year 1993 witnessed the greatest tax increase in American history, until recently. Just 3 months into this new Congress, the Democrats have shown their vision for America with a more than $400 billion budget increase, an increase which can only be paid for through a colossal scale of taxation that will reach nearly every American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government has created a monster. Today, our Tax Code and regulations bulge at over 60,000 pages. I have yet to meet anyone who has read all of them. Americans pay billions of dollars to accountants and financial advisers just to comply with this labyrinth of rules. More than 50 percent of all taxpayers pay someone else to prepare their tax returns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Planning for the future is challenging enough without the added headache of complex taxes and confusing deductions, not to mention the uncertainty of how taxes may change from one year to the next. Congress has the moral responsibility to remove the obstacles it has created that punish Americans who are simply working hard to achieve their dreams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues in Congress to overhaul our cumbersome tax system.</paragraph>
