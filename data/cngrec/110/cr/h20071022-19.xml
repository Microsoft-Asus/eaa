    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="830">H.R. 830</bill> was introduced by the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young). The legislation would authorize an exchange of easements on land along the Alaska Railroad track inside the Denali National Park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The exchange would make it possible for the railroad to build a turnaround track near the Denali Park station, helping to accommodate the increasing popularity of rail travel in the park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is an exchange of easements only. No park land will change hands. The railroad has an existing easement along its entire track, granted as a result of the 1982 Alaska Railroad Transfer Act. But the easement will not accommodate the turnaround.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="830">H.R. 830</bill> would allow the Secretary of the Interior to grant a new easement for the turnaround. In exchange, the railroad will relinquish its existing easement on an approximate equal number of acres elsewhere along the current track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we support <bill type="h" number="830">H.R. 830</bill>, as amended, and recommend its adoption by the House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400440" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the full committee and the chairman of the subcommittee for allowing this legislation to come to the floor of the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a sponsor of <bill type="h" number="830">H.R. 830</bill> and of the Alaska Railroad Transfer Act of 1982, I am pleased we are considering this legislation today. Although it is small, the land exchange provided by <bill type="h" number="830">H.R. 830</bill> will improve the ability of the Alaska Railroad Corporation to serve its customers who wish to visit Denali National Park. The construction of a turnaround track will increase scheduling frequency and flexibility. This not only reduces overcrowding of Denali at any one time, it makes the Park Service's job  of managing visitation much smoother.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a noncontroversial bill and enjoys the support of the National Park Service, the State of Alaska which owns the railroad, and the National Parks Conservation Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For anyone who has not traveled on the Alaska Railroad, it is a journey you should not miss. For those who have had an opportunity to enjoy the splendor of Alaska's scenery aboard the train, I am sure you will agree it is a first-class experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You may not know, but Alaska Railroad was once owned by the Federal Government; but Congress in its wisdom passed bipartisan legislation in 1982 to transfer the railroad to the State of Alaska. As Congress faces immense backlogs in caring for Federal assets, perhaps there is a lesson to be learned here. We might consider transferring more of these assets to the States. Alaska has proven it can take a Federal asset like the Alaska Railroad and manage it for the benefit of everyone who uses it.  I believe this is a fine piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair>The title was amended so as to read: "A bill to authorize the exchange of certain interests in land in Denali National Park in the State of Alaska.".</chair>
