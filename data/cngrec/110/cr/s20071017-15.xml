    <paragraph>Mr. Presdient, I actually came here to talk about a different subject, and that is the fracas that is now engulfing the National Democratic Party with regard to the selection of its Presidential nominees. Florida is right in the middle of this because an order was set up under the rules of the Democratic National Committee that allowed four States to go before any other State, and those four States, they set out an order and said it would be first a caucus in Iowa, then  a caucus in Nevada, then an election, a primary election in New Hampshire, and then a primary  election in South Carolina. Those were going to be representative of the country and all of those four had to occur before any other State could start its primary or caucus in the selection of the Presidential nominees and that the date they could start was February 5 of next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the objection of Democratic State legislators in the Florida legislature--indeed, with the Democratic leader of the Florida Senate offering an amendment to keep Florida's election from violating the Democratic National Committee rules and, therefore, to be on February 5, over his and others' objections--the Florida legislature changed the date of the Florida Presidential primary from March to January 29. The Florida legislature is basically two-thirds Republican, one-third Democrat, in both  Houses of the legislature. Governor Crist, a Republican, signed the legislation, setting the Florida primary date as January 29, and signed it into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democratic National Committee took great umbrage at this and under its rules said it was going to strip Florida of half its delegates. That is what the Democratic National Committee rules provide. In the Democratic National Committee Rules Committee's deliberations, they went further. Unlike the Republican National Committee, which said they would take away half of Florida's delegates for the Presidential nominee, the DNC said: We are going to punish Florida completely by taking away all  their delegates to the convention. What is more, we are going to enforce a part of the DNC rules that say, unless Florida backs up and ignores that election, makes it a "beauty contest" that has no meaning and selects their delegates sometime from February 5 or later, Florida was going to receive additional punishment, which</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is as violative of the constitutional right of freedom of speech as anything I have ever heard. It conjures up that you can't come to Florida so Florida Democratic voters can interact with Presidential candidates unless you pay a fee at the door in order to gain entrance because it is a fundraiser. Doesn't that remind you of something that was held unconstitutional called a poll tax?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was because of this kind of punishment that was inflicted on the 4.25 million registered Florida Democrats that this Senator, with a heavy heart, joined with his colleague, Congressman ALCEE HASTINGS, also with a heavy heart, and filed suit in Federal District Court in Tallahassee, the seat of government of our State, against Howard Dean, the chairman of the DNC, and the Democratic National Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A defendant was also named, Kurt Browning, the secretary of state of Florida, purely for functionary purposes since he is the one authorized under Florida law to conduct the election. As a result, that suit had been filed 2 weeks ago alleging the violations of the Constitution in the 1st, 5th, and 14th amendments, as well as violations of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Federal court will ultimately determine that issue of whether the party has the right to prohibit people, in a duly called, State-run, State-sanctioned by State law election, whether that national party can take away those constitutional rights of people to see and hear and interact with the Presidential candidates, as well as taking away all of their ability to be heard at the national convention by stripping away all of the elements. That is the issue in front of the court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It should not have come to this. For the last 6 months, I and others, like Congressman Hastings, have offered compromises on three different occasions, three different compromises on how we could get out of this box. It would be a win-win situation, but the DNC and its rules committee said "nyet," they are going to sanction Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why am I making this speech this day, Mr. President, when the suit was filed 2 weeks ago? Because there is a news article in this morning's papers saying that the Iowa Republican Party has announced that it is bumping up its caucus, not where it was previously prescribed--somewhere in the middle of January of next year--but instead moving it up to January 3. And South Carolina Republicans, some time ago, had a joint press conference with the secretary of state of New Hampshire, who under New  Hampshire law is the sole authority to determine what date New Hampshire's primary, both Democratic and Republican, will be held, and the South Carolina Republicans announced that they were moving their primary up some 10 days earlier--it might have been 8 or 9 days, but it was earlier than the prescribed time of January 29--to which the New Hampshire secretary of state said he would move New Hampshire's primary up early.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the question that is begged today, Wednesday, the middle of October, is, if all of these parties are jumping early and the order that the Democratic National Committee wanted to preserve is being thwarted, does the DNC intend only to punish Florida Democrats or will, in fact, they punish the Democratic parties in New Hampshire and Iowa if they, in fact, jump forward from what the DNC rules had prescribed?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I bring to the floor of the Senate something that involves only a few States. Yet it has enormous implications for the entire country because this is the process by which we select the Presidential candidates of the two major parties, one of which is likely to be the next President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of all this fracas and I think just the news of today that indicates the Iowa parties are jumping much earlier, we will probably now see all of the others start to jump, and as a result there will be increased turmoil. It is certainly my hope that reason will prevail and the Democratic National Committee, which has taken out its frustration on Florida, will suddenly realize there is no reason to continue that frustration on Florida because, at the end of the day, if everybody else is  doing it, why just try to punish Florida? And because of this fracas, this turmoil, will reason prevail that there is a better way to do this? It is regional primaries spaced out in a logical order over one in March, two in April, two in May, and one in June, that would give the candidates plenty</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's bring order out of this chaos in the way we select the next President of the United States in both of these great political parties that participate in American politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is none of my business, but I say to the Senator from Florida that I tend to agree with him. Maybe it is a regional thing. I wish him good luck in his effort to have Florida assume its rightful place.</paragraph>
