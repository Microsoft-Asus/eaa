    <paragraph>Mr. President, last week I attended a ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda to commemorate the 2007 Holocaust Days of Remembrance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fred Zeidman and Joel Geiderman, Chairman and Vice Chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council, spoke eloquently about the horror and courage, the unspeakable tragedy and unimaginable heroism that even 62 years later we cannot begin to comprehend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sara Bloomfield, Director of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, as well as my colleague, Senator JOE LIEBERMAN, added their own powerful words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was privileged to sit beside Steven Schwarz. As we sat together, Steven listened silently, tears streaming down his face. Afterward, he told me his story.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Poland, Steven lost both parents and a brother in the Holocaust. Forged with sheer willpower and blessings from God, he, his late wife Tina, and his brother Henryk managed to survive by hiding out in Poland. In 1953, they came to the United States and were welcomed with open arms. In the years that followed, Steven and his brother rose to become prominent and successful businessmen, overcoming great suffering to live the American dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Steven Schwarz embodies the grace and fortitude of all those who wrested triumph from despair. I am honored to have shared that day of remembrance with him and pleased to now pay tribute to his life story in the Record of the U.S. Congress as a powerful and poignant example of the unbreakable human spirit.</paragraph>
