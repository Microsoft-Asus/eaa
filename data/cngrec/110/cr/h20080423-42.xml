    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="5712">H.R. 5712</bill>) to require disclosure by Federal contractors of certain violations relating to the award or performance of Federal contracts, as amended.</paragraph>

    <bill type="h" number="5712">H.R. 5712</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1.

REVISION OF THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION.</narrative>
  <narrative>  The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall be amended within 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act pursuant to FAR Case 2007-006 (as published at 72 Fed Reg. 64019, November 14, 2007) or any follow-on FAR case to include provisions that require timely notification by Federal contractors of violations of Federal criminal law or overpayments in connection with the award or performance of covered contracts or subcontracts, including those performed outside the United States and those  for commercial items.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3. DEFINITION.</narrative>
  <narrative> In this Act, the term "covered contract" means any contract in an amount greater than $5,000,000 and more than 120 days in duration.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5712">H.R. 5712</bill>, the Close the Contractor Fraud Loophole Act, is a commonsense solution to a problem that we never should have had in the first place. When the administration wrote a new rule requiring Federal contractors to report fraud and over billing on government contracts, for some reason contracts performed overseas and commercial item contracts were exempted from that requirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That didn't make sense to my colleague on the Subcommittee on Government Management, Congressman Welch, because so much contract fraud and waste has been seen on contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan. He introduced this bill which will close these loopholes, and I salute him for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Justice Department believes the new rule is necessary because few government contractors voluntarily disclose suspected instances of fraud. But the exemptions in the rule as written would leave out contractors like those in Iraq and Afghanistan, where we have spent billions on reconstruction contracts over the past 5 years. Over that period, the Justice Department has uncovered at least $14 million in contract bribes in those two countries alone. Contractors must be held to the same standards  no matter where they perform their work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since Congressman Welch brought attention to this loophole, introduced this bill, and called for the hearing our subcommittee held last week, the administration has said it is leaning toward including overseas and commercial item contracts in the final fraud reporting rule. I am happy to hear that, but we cannot get them to guarantee that these loopholes would be closed. That is why Mr. Welch's bill is necessary, to make sure that loopholes are closed for good. Another way to  put it, this legislation will help them deal with a problem that should not have occurred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Congressman Welch for bringing this problem to the attention of the subcommittee. I would also like to thank the chairman of our full committee, Congressman Waxman, and also thank the ranking member of the full committee, Congressman Davis. And I would like to thank the ranking member of the subcommittee, Congressman Bilbray, for helping us bring this bill to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at a time when our national security is of paramount concern, criminals who cheat the government must be identified, stopped and punished. <bill type="h" number="5712">H.R. 5712</bill> will help make sure that taxpayer dollars are used for their intended purpose, and not to line the pockets of corrupt individuals or companies. So I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5712">H.R. 5712</bill>, the Close the Contractor Fraud Loophole Act. This bill would create a mandatory requirement for Federal contractors to disclose violations of Federal criminal law or significant overcharges discovered with relationship to a Federal contract. It would replace our current system of voluntary disclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moving to mandatory disclosure has been recommended by the Justice Department for good reason, the voluntary disclosure system is simply not working. In fiscal year 2007, only three contractors participated in the Defense Department's voluntary disclosure program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Congressman Welch introduced this bill after the administration exempted contracts performed in Iraq and Afghanistan from a proposal to make fraud reporting mandatory. This exemption made no sense. As this committee's oversight has shown, fraud and over-billing are widespread in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration testified at a hearing before the Government Management Subcommittee that these exemptions were included inadvertently, and they said they made a mistake. This is a mistake that needs to be corrected, and that's why I commend Congressman Welch for pressing this issue and introducing this legislation. If we pass this bill, the real winners will be the Federal taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to our committee markup on the bill, we worked with Ranking Member Davis to address certain concerns he raised with the way the bill was originally drafted. And I want to thank Mr. Davis for working with us in a constructive manner to ensure passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us, <bill type="h" number="5712">H.R. 5712</bill>, as amended, would preserve Representative Welch's original intent while at the same time preserving the legitimate role of the regulatory process. The bill requires that the Federal Acquisition Regulation be amended within 180 days to require disclosure of fraud for both domestic and overseas contracts, and for commercial item contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge Members to support <bill type="h" number="5712">H.R. 5712</bill>, as amended. It has been approved by a bipartisan vote in our committee, and it ought to be overwhelmingly approved in the House as well.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Mr. DAVIS of Virginia asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I had serious concerns about this legislation when it was originally introduced. The original version would have required a Federal contractor to self-report to the agency's IG if the contractor had reasonable grounds to suspect a violation of criminal law or if a significant overpayment occurred on a contract held by the contractor. A knowing failure to make such a report would have been a cause for debarment or a suspension for all firms, including those  holding contracts performed overseas and contracts for commercial items.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This original version, in my judgment, was an ill-considered attempt to strengthen an ethics compliance program that's currently being developed by the administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The concept of mandatory self-reporting by contractors of possible criminal violations, based on reasonable grounds, would have been unprecedented and obviously controversial. The rule proposed in the Federal Register was the subject of more than 70 comments. As expected, many of the firms subject to the rule expressed serious legitimate concerns about the proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In actuality, the bill as introduced didn't make as significant change as intended to the substance of the proposed revisions. The problem was the bill leapfrogged the statutorily designated process for writing acquisition regulations, and would have encased in statute draft language establishing a new reporting scheme yet to be thoroughly vetted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The subcommittee received testimony that the so-called loophole which was alleged to have been snuck in at the 11th hour, was really an inadvertent administrative error made by an overworked acquisition policy staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>None of the agencies providing testimony to the subcommittee, including the Department of Justice, nor the contractor community, supported this bill as it was introduced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I will say this to the author of the legislation and the subcommittee chairman, we ended up working together, and the language before us today was offered in his amendment at mark-up by Chairman Waxman and myself. This will ensure that the Federal acquisition regulation is revised to include a requirement that Federal contractors notify the government of violations of Federal, criminal law or overpayments in connection with the award or performance of contracts or subcontracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In doing so, it will ensure the regulation is applicable to all contracts, including those performed overseas and those for commercial items.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The stated purpose was ultimately accomplished by this language but accomplished through a more appropriate statutory acquisition rulemaking process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, as with the other contractor bills we're considering today, I think that we would be better served if we would address some of the underlying problems in the acquisition system, and that is getting in good acquisition officials; whether they're contract managers, contracting officers, contracting officers technical representatives, trying to get more into government, educating them, training them and making sure they have the tools appropriate to get the best value for the tax dollars.  That's where the real waste of government lies with having good acquisition officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this version of the bill today is an adequate solution. I want to thank again Chairman Waxman and Mr. Welch for working with us to revise the language. I urge its adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we rise to take up <bill type="h" number="5712">H.R. 5712</bill>, the Close the Contractor Fraud Loophole Act. This legislation would revise an administration-proposed contractor ethics and reporting program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had serious concerns about this legislation as it was originally introduced. The original version of the bill would have required a Federal contractor to self-report to the agency's Inspector General if the contractor had "reasonable grounds" to suspect a violation of criminal law or if a significant overpayment occurred on a contract held by the contractor. A knowing failure to make such a report would have been a cause for debarment or suspension for all firms, including those holding contracts  performed overseas and contracts for commercial items.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This original version of the legislation was an ill-considered attempt to "strengthen" an ethics compliance program currently under development by the administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The concept of mandatory self-reporting by contractors of possible criminal violations based on "reasonable grounds" is unprecedented and controversial. The rule proposed in the Federal Register was the subject of more than 70 comments. As expected, many of the firms subject to the rule expressed serious and legitimate concerns about the proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In actuality, the bill as introduced did not make as significant a change as intended to the substance of the proposed revisions to the acquisition regulations. The problem was the bill leapfrogged the statutorily designated process for writing acquisition regulations and would have encased in statute draft language establishing a new reporting scheme yet to be thoroughly vetted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Subcommittee on Government Management, Organization and Procurement received testimony that the so-called "loophole"--which was alleged to have been "snuck in at the eleventh hour"--was really an inadvertent administrative error made by an overworked acquisition policy workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>None of the agencies providing testimony to the Subcommittee, including the Department of Justice, nor the contractor community, supported <bill type="h" number="5712">H.R. 5712</bill> as introduced. Instead, the stakeholders suggested the well-established regulatory drafting process should be allowed to continue to completion. They favored this rulemaking approach because it would allow all interested parties the opportunity to submit comments and have those comments considered in the deliberative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevertheless, the Committee moved forward with the legislation. Fortunately, Chairman Waxman, the bill's sponsor and I were able to work out language which addressed some of the concerns raised at the one hearing on the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language before us today, offered as an amendment at markup by Chairman Waxman and me, would ensure the Federal Acquisition Regulation is revised to include a requirement that Federal contractors notify the Government of violations of Federal criminal law or overpayments in connection with the award or performance of contracts or subcontracts. In doing so, it would ensure the regulation is applicable to all contracts, including those performed overseas and those for commercial items.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The stated purposes of the introduced version of <bill type="h" number="5712">H.R. 5712</bill> are ultimately accomplished by this language, but accomplished through the more appropriate statutory acquisition rulemaking process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, as with the other so-called "contractor bills" we are considering today, I continue to believe all would be better served if we had spent our time trying to improve the operation of our acquisition system--in order to better acquire the best value goods and services our Government so desperately needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in this case, I am certain we would have been be better off had we allowed the regulatory process to go forward without any interference at all from us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nonetheless, under the circumstances, I believe this version of the bill we are considering today is an adequate solution, and I thank Chairman Waxman and Mr. Welch for working with me on the revised language.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 5 minutes to the author of this legislation, a person that has worked real hard and has done a magnificent job, the gentleman from Vermont, Congressman Welch.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, one of the fundamental responsibilities that this Congress has is to protect taxpayer dollars. That has become an enormous challenge, as many of the taxpayer dollars that are appropriated are paid to private contractors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The growth in contracting in the past 6 or 7 years has exploded. Procurement spending in 2000 was $213 billion. Procurement spending is when we enter into a contract with a private company to deliver goods or services. That amount exploded last year to $412 billion. Much of that is going to Iraq and Afghanistan. Much of this is being subject to waste, fraud and abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Oversight Committee under Mr. Waxman and Mr. Davis has done vigorous oversight and identified in 2006 that there were 118 contracts valued at $745 billion that were found by government auditors to include a significant component of fraud, abuse and mismanagement. And, in fact, it got worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2008, that report identified 187 contracts valued at $1.1 trillion, where they were plagued by waste, fraud and abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is, will we, as a Congress, Republicans and Democrats, be vigilant in protecting taxpayer dollars? We have to do that, especially when there is documented evidence of rip-offs, wicked rip-offs that have occurred with taxpayer dollars in Afghanistan and in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's two goals that we have. The first that we widely share is that every taxpayer dollar will be accounted for, and that the taxpayers who were working hard to support this government and our troops will see that their money is spent on proper things that are in the contract. We have to protect the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second is we've got to protect the troops. If we are spending money in Iraq and Afghanistan for the intended purpose of bringing our troops home and improving our national security, any dollar that's wasted that results in any additional injury, or one day prolonged in the conflicts, is a dollar that is improperly wasted. We cannot do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I believe that this loophole, however it got there, by mistake or by sleight of hand, however it got there, it's got to be closed. Obviously, if you have a regulation, as it was written, that says we will report fraud when it is a rip-off on a domestic contract, but we won't when it's on a foreign contract, we're sending a very unambiguous message. There's a green light to rip off taxpayers if the money is being spent abroad. That's not a defensible position. And that's why we're closing this  loophole to make it absolutely clear that's unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now I think it does make sense. What Congressman Davis proposed as a new way of proceeding is fine with me. And here's why. The bottom line is protecting the taxpayers and protecting our troops. And if we can accomplish that better by finding a way that has bipartisan support, we can all have more confidence that we'll be successful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I'm glad to work with Chairman Davis in order to have this get done in a bipartisan way. I want to thank very much Chairman Waxman and the great work of my chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Towns, for bringing this forward so quickly and so effectively.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, let me thank my friend for calling me Chairman Davis. It's with nostalgia that I use the terminology, but I guess once a chairman, always a chairman. But I now recognize Mr. Waxman as my chairman and a counterpart in a number of these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I again enjoyed working with you on this legislation to bring it. I would urge its adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400409" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Waxman; I want to thank Ranking Member Davis; and, of course, Ranking Member Bilbray for his work; and, of course, Congressman Welch. This legislation is really needed, and I was happy that we were able to move it to the floor very quickly, because any time we can save money, and I think that this is what this does, it saves the taxpayers money, and I just think we need to salute Congressman Welch for  his insight in being able to do just that.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="5712">H.R. 5712</bill>, the "Close the Contractor Fraud Loophole Act."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The name of this bill really says it all. Today, as I speak, there is a loophole in Government procurement regulations that allows some contractors to avoid reporting violations of Federal law or overpayments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The privilege--and, yes, it's a privilege--of earning Federal dollars carries with it certain responsibilities. One of those responsibilities is to do your utmost to avoid fraud, violations of law, and overpayments. Now, I understand that many large contractors have thousands of employees, and sometimes there can be a bad apple. But when a contractor learns of such a bad apple, it is its responsibility to report what it learns to the Government, and to make the Government whole for any loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, most contractors working in the United States are required by regulation to do just this. But contractors working overseas, and a few here in the U.S., fall outside this simple, commonsense reporting requirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not right--contractors accepting Federal dollars should be treated the same, whether they are performing the work in the United States or overseas, and regardless of whether they are selling "commercial items."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend Mr. Welch and Chairman Waxman for recognizing this problem, and for doing something about it. Now that they have acted, the administration says that this loophole was a "bureaucratic mistake" and should be closed. Yet, before Congress moved, the administration was curiously slow to do anything to address this "mistake."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My committee has devoted a lot of time and energy to examining the Department of Homeland Security's contracting practices. What we have found is not always pretty. The Department is young, and has made some poor contracting decisions. But poor decisionmaking and the occasional inexperienced contracting officer is not a license for abuse, and it is incumbent on any contractor who discovers such abuse to report it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the administration makes good on its word and closes this loophole, but I'm mindful that it took congressional oversight and action to stir them into action. This is oversight at it best, and make no mistake, our oversight--of both the Government and the contractors themselves--will continue. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
