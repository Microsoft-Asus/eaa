  <narrative>IOWA CITY COMMUNITY EDUCATION -- (Senate - September 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9020">S9020</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in Iowa and across the United States, a new school year has begun. As you know, Iowa public schools have an excellent reputation nationwide, and Iowa students' test scores are among the highest in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take just a few minutes, today, to salute the dedicated teachers, administrators, and school board members in the Iowa City Community School District, and to report on their participation in a unique Federal partnership to repair and modernize school facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This fall marks the 10th year of the Iowa Demonstration Construction Grant Program. That is its formal name, but it is better known among educators in Iowa as the program of Harkin grants for Iowa public schools. Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 million for the State government in Iowa, which selects worthy school districts to receive these grants for a range of renovation and repair efforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new schools or renovating  existing facilities. In many cases, this Federal funding is used to leverage public and/or private local funding, so it often has a tremendous multiplier effect in a local school district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Iowa City Community School District received a 2002 Harkin grant totaling $1 million which it used to help build Tate Alternative High School. The district also received a 2004 construction grant for $500,000 to build an addition at Kirkwood Elementary School which includes a gymnasium and three kindergarten classrooms and to build an addition at Grant Wood Elementary School which includes a gymnasium, a family resource center and a prekindergarten classroom. These schools are the modern,  state-of-the-art facilities that befit the educational ambitions and excellence of this school district. Indeed, they are the kind of schools that every child in America deserves. The district also received a $250,000 fire safety grant to make improvements at City High School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. They are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a tremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned citizens. I salute the entire staff, administration, and governance in the Iowa City Community School District. In particular, I would like to recognize the leadership of the board of education--Toni Cilek, Liz Crooks, Mike Cooper, Patti Fields, Jan Leff, Gayle Klouda, Tim Krumm and Michael Shaw  and former board members Pete Wallace, Matt Goodlaxson, Lauren Reece, Don Jackson, David Franker and Aletia Morgan as well as superintendent Lane Plugge and physical plant director Paul Schultz.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Iowa City Community School District passed a $39 million bond issue to modernize facilities throughout the district including the three projects discussed earlier. I would like to recognize Charlie Funk and Sarah Swisher for their leadership on Yes for Kids Committee and the cities of Iowa City and Coralville for their partnerships with the district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we mark the 10th anniversary of the Harkin school grant program in Iowa, I am obliged to point out that many thousands of school buildings and facilities across the United States are in dire need of renovation or replacement. In my State of Iowa alone, according to a recent study, some 79 percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. The harsh reality is that the average age of school buildings in the United States is nearly 50 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too often, our children visit ultramodern shopping malls and gleaming sports arenas on weekends, but during the week go to school in rundown or antiquated facilities. This sends exactly the wrong message to our young people about our priorities. We have to do better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am deeply grateful to the professionals and parents in the Iowa City Community School District. There is no question that a quality public education for every child is a top priority in that community. I salute them, and wish them a very successful new school year.</paragraph>
