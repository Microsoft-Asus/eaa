  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="BOYER VALLEY COMMUNITY EDUCATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in Iowa and across the United States, a new school year has begun. As you know, Iowa public schools have an excellent reputation nationwide, and Iowa students' test scores are among the highest in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take just a few minutes today to salute the dedicated teachers, administrators, and school board members in the Boyer Valley Community School District, and to report on their participation in a unique Federal partnership to repair and modernize school facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This fall marks the 10th year of the Iowa Demonstration Construction Grant Program. That is its formal name, but it is better known among educators in Iowa as the program of Harkin grants for Iowa public schools. Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 million for the State government in Iowa, which selects worthy school districts to receive these grants for a range of renovation and repair efforts everything from updating fire safety systems to building new schools or renovating  existing facilities. In many cases, this Federal funding is used to leverage public and/or private local funding, so it often has a tremendous multiplier effect in a local school district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Boyer Valley Community School District received a 2002 Harkin grant totaling $1 million which it used to help build an addition to the school in Dow City to provide a multipurpose room that could be used by the community as well as the school. The district collaborated with the City of Dunlap to build an addition to the middle/high school to house the community/school library. This school is a modern, state-of-the-art facility that befits the educational ambitions and excellence of this school  district. Indeed, it is the kind of school facility that every child in America deserves. The district also received a $25,000 fire safety grant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. They are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a tremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned citizens. I salute the entire staff, administration, and governance in the Boyer Valley Community School District. In particular, I would like to recognize the leadership of the board of education--Ken Dunham, Pat Putnam, Julie Wood, Steve Puck, Paul Klein, Mark McAllister, and Randy Mitchell, and  former board members Roger Waderich, Theresa McAllister, Ruth Sherwood, Sam Cogdill, Sam Head, and Jane Davie as well as superintendent Thomas Vint and former superintendent Debra Johnsen. I would also like to recognize the city of Dow City and mayor Ace Ettleman, the city of Dunlap and treasurer Dwaine Hack and the late mayor Giles Lacey and the committee that worked to pass the bond referendum for the new schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we mark the 10th anniversary of the Harkin school grant program in Iowa, I am obliged to point out that many thousands of school buildings and facilities across the United States are in dire need of renovation or replacement. In my State of Iowa alone, according to a recent study, some 79 percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. The harsh reality is that the average age of school buildings in the United States is nearly 50 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too often, our children visit ultramodern shopping malls and gleaming sports arenas on weekends, but during the week go to school in rundown or antiquated facilities. This sends exactly the wrong message to our young people about our priorities. We have to do better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am deeply grateful to the professionals and parents in the Boyer Valley Community School District. There is no question that a quality public education for every child is a top priority in that community. I salute them, and wish them a very successful new school year.</paragraph>
