  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the failure of Congress to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act is a breach of faith to more than 600 forested counties and 4,400 school districts across our great country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are more than 400 miles of paved road in Morrow County, Oregon, where every county road leads to a national forest. Loss of this program and funds means no portion of any paved road will be replaced and basic maintenance will stop. One of the most expensive roads for the county to maintain runs through the Umatilla National Forest and is a designated scenic byway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without county payments, people won't be able to safely access their public lands, and the hope of a new outdoor recreation economy to replace the lost timber jobs goes unfulfilled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>County Public Works Director Burke O'Brien says: "We are not the ones who stopped our sustainable Federal timber harvest. However, now we are being forced to lose even the funds promised to replace the lost forest revenues."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues, Congress must keep the Federal Government's word and its promise to the timbered communities. It is time to get a hearing and a markup and to pass <bill type="h" number="17">H.R. 17</bill>. Time is running out for forested timber communities.</paragraph>
