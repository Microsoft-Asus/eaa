    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, during a routine traffic stop, an illegal immigrant named Juan Leonardo Quintero-Perez shot Houston Police Officer Rodney Johnson in the back of the head and killed him. This case highlights the illegal immigrant epidemic in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems, however, that Juan Quintero-Perez had already been deported before from the United States. In 1998, Quintero was arrested and convicted of indecency with a child in Texas and then was deported back to Mexico. But Perez was able to return to the United States a few months later because his employer, Robert Camp, sent money to Mexico to hire a smuggler that snuck Perez back to Houston.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Camp knew that Quintero-Perez was an illegal immigrant and a criminal, but Camp hired him again anyway. Camp even rented a home for Quintero-Perez, and then Perez murdered Officer Johnson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who knowingly hire and house illegal immigrants, all in the name of making a little money, should go to jail. Rodney Johnson's blood is on the hands of the employer who brought the illegal outlaw back to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
