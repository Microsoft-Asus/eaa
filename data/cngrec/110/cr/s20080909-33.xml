    <paragraph>Mr. President, on August 20, America lost one of her bravest heroes, and I am honored to say he was an Idahoan. Ed "Too Tall" W. Freeman, U.S. Army, retired, was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for actions undertaken during the battle of Ia Drang in Vietnam in November, 1965. Recounted in the book by Joseph Galloway, "We Were Soldiers Once ..... And Young," Ed's bravery became legend. American forces were heavily engaged with North Vietnamese soldiers and the medical  evacuation helicopters refused to fly into the battle zone to retrieve soldiers--it was deemed too dangerous. The infantry commander asked for volunteers, and young Captain Freeman, followed by LTC Bruce Crandall, stepped forward and offered to fly, unarmed, to the battlefield to bring supplies and carry out the wounded. Ed flew 14 separate missions and his actions, literally under fire, saved life and limb of 30 soldiers--all in a landing zone</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he retired from the Army in 1966, Ed continued flying helicopters, this time for the U.S. Department of the Interior, conducting animal censes, herding horses and fighting fires. In 2001, Ed was presented the Congressional Medal of Honor by President George W. Bush for his actions during the Battle of Ia Drang.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ed was laid to rest in the Idaho State Veteran's Cemetery, a beautiful place that overlooks a vista bounded to the south by the Snake River Valley and distant mountains, to the east and west by a vast expanse of open sky, and behind to the north, by foothills rising to meet their less-weathered relatives. The wind blows with reassuring regularity, and it seems that in this western meeting place of land and sky, at once comfortingly familiar and awe-inspiring, it is indeed an appropriate place  for Ed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a tribute written upon Ed's death, author, former war correspondent and friend Joseph Galloway said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too Tall Ed was 80 years old when he died in a hospital in Boise, Idaho, after long being ill with Parkinson's disease. He turned down a full dress hero's funeral in Arlington National Cemetery in favor of a hometown service and burial ..... close to the rivers he loved to fish and the mountains he flew through in his second career flying for the U.S. Forest Service ..... Now Too Tall Ed Freeman, a much larger than life-size hero ..... and a much better friend than we deserved, is gone, and we  are left with too large a hole in our hearts and in our dwindling ranks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Ed spoke to a reporter in Idaho back in 2000, he recounted those 14 harrowing hours. He said, "That Huey helicopter was my tool, and I was trained to use it. It was capable of flying into that hell hole, and I was capable of making it do that." When asked if he was afraid he said he ate "franks and beans" and chain-smoked. "God knows how many I smoked. Till I had a blister on my tongue." When asked about why he volunteered for this dangerous duty, he said: "You don't think, `I'm going  to go out and win the Medal of Honor.' You're going to win a body bag if you're not real lucky."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, in a testament to Ed's humble nature, his comment on his heroism was simply: "I did think I possibly did a little more than was required of me. But again, I had a job to do."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a tremendous honor for me to pay tribute to Ed W. Freeman, and my condolences go to his wife Barbara, his sons, and their families at this difficult time.</paragraph>
