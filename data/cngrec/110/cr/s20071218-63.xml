    <paragraph>Mr. President, with the holiday season upon us, I rise today to recognize a Maine small business that operates with a philosophy of giving back to those in need. Simply Divine Brownies of Brunswick is a baker and distributor of gourmet brownies and assorted gift packages that recently received well-deserved attention for finishing second in Forbes magazine's Boost Your Business contest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded in November 2004 as a home business by Trina Beaulier, Simply Divine Brownies is a true treat for the taste buds. In just 3 years, the company has grown to 20 employees, including Trina's daughter Meggen, and now operates in Brunswick's historic Fort Andross Mill. Its gourmet brownies range from the chocolate and nut-filled brownies to the more eclectic cappuccino or peppermint frosted brownies. Seizing the opportunity to bring a creative twist to the epicurean world, Simply Divine produces  brownies with a unique Maine accent. The Need'him is a chocolate and coconut brownie based on the needham, a traditional Maine cookie. And the Singin' the Blues consists of a chocolate brownie that is covered with blueberry buttercream frosting and topped with wild Maine blueberries. Simply Divine's brownies also</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What makes the company so special--aside from its delicious baked goods--is what Trina and Meggen do to help the less fortunate. Seeking to use their skills to help others, they developed the Divine Intervention Brownie Collection. These specialty brownies come in the shape of hearts and stars, and after each purchase of one of these sets, Simply Divine donates a portion of the proceeds to Volunteers for America, a national nonprofit group that assists people of all ages in rebuilding their lives.  Whether it be helping the homeless find safe and affordable housing, or aiding at-risk teens and those with mental illnesses, Volunteers for America helps over 2 million people in over 400 communities, a task that it has successfully performed since 1896.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all their hard work and success, the Beauliers have been celebrated in various capacities over the past several years. Their brownies have been cited as the Snack of the Day on the "Rachel Ray Show" and have also been featured on NBC's "Today's Show." Most recently, and perhaps most prominently, Simply Divine came in second in online voting for a Forbes magazine contest to receive a financial assistance package to grow its business. They beat out nearly 1,000 other small companies to  place in the final round. Having to create a forward-looking business plan for the contest has been of tremendous benefit to the Beauliers, who say that their newfound knowledge, combined with increased sales and peaked interest in the company, has allowed them to forge ahead with their planned expansion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past 3 years, Simply Divine Brownies has made a name for itself. As a family-owned small business that has flourished and continues to receive accolades of the highest accord, Simply Divine's growth certainly has not gone unnoticed. Yet, through it all, the Beauliers and the employees at Simply Divine have found the will and desire to make a difference, and they are to be commended for their insatiable appetite to brighten the lives of others. I wish Trina and Meggen Beaulier and everyone  at Simply Divine Brownies a happy holiday season, and continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
