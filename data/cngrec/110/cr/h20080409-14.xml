    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, hopefully in the very near future Congress will be ready to vote on a new farm bill, one that would help our farmers and our agricultural community continue to do what they do so very well, feed America and help feed the entire world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We recognize and we encourage the very hard work and the ongoing negotiations between the House, the Senate and the administration as we face the expiration of the current farm bill on April 18. But planting season is here, and our farmers are faced with difficult decisions about what crops to plant and how much without knowing what direction the Federal Government is moving, and yet we look to our farmers to provide us with a stable food supply. There are many issues affecting the development  of every farmer's business plan this year and into the next, certainly the rising prices of fuel and other costs as well, but the uncertainty of the national farm program needs to be resolved as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working together with our House and our Senate leaders and the administration on a successful piece of legislation that will serve our farmers and all Americans fairly and well.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
