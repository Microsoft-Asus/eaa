    <paragraph>Thank you, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I'm delighted to have Father Ronald Calkins here today to offer our opening prayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Father Calkins, a constituent from my district, is the pastor of Mary Queen of Peace Catholic Church in Mandeville, Louisiana. Appointed in July 1995, Father Calkins has led Mary Queen of Peace through a period of rapid growth and overseen the opening of Mary Queen of Peace Catholic School, which turned 10 years old this past August.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are honored to have Father Calkins with us here today. He has shown remarkable leadership, especially as his parish and as our State has struggled through and is recovering from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. I thank him for his dedication, his service to his parish, and to the residents of southeast Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We welcome Father Calkins as well as the students and their chaperones from Mary Queen of Peace Catholic Church and School.</paragraph>
