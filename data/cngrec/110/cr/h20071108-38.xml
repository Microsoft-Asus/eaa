  <chair>Amendment No. 12 Offered by Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite of Florida:</chair>

  <chair> (3) PRICE GOUGING.--The term "price gouging" means the providing of any consumer good or service by a supplier related to repair or restoration of property damaged from a catastrophe for a price that the supplier knows or has reason to know is greater, by at least the percentage set forth in a State law or regulation prohibiting such act (not withstanding any real cost increase due to any attendant business risk and other reasonable expenses that result from the major catastrophe involved),  than the price charged by the supplier for such consumer good or service immediately before the disaster.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Page 24, line 4, redesignate paragraph (3) as paragraph (4).&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Page 24, line 8, redesignate paragraph (4) as paragraph (5).</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, for too long, Congress has taken a reserved and reactionary approach to helping victims of disasters. For too long, Members have fallen back on a naive notion that a national plan would only put taxpayers at risk. We have refused to admit that in the event of a natural disaster, we either pay now or we pay later, and paying later is a whole lot more expensive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please consider this: in 2005 the insurance industry, not the taxpayers, paid out $61.2 billion for the 24 disasters that occurred that year; $40 billion of that went to the insured losses of Hurricane Katrina. That same year, Congress, using taxpayer dollars, awarded over $89 billion in post-disaster assistance, $89 billion that will never be recouped, that came from hardworking constituents from Illinois, for example, from my colleague who offered the amendment before, from West Virginia, from  the State of the lady who is handling the bill on this side. Unless these constituents were directly affected by these events, they will never see a return of those dollars that the Federal Government provided. What is the lesson here? When Congress pays later, it's with taxpayer money that's never paid back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the first time, this bill and the manager's amendment provide a national plan to protect against losses. <bill type="h" number="3355">H.R. 3355</bill> provides incentives to States to join a national consortium to issue catastrophic bonds. These bonds act as an alternative to costly reinsurance. It also provides some loans to the States that take the time to plan for their insured needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment that we have at the desk today also relates to when a natural disaster strikes. How many natural disasters have we heard about, whether it's a tremendous snowstorm in the Northeast, whether it's a hurricane, whether it's an earthquake in California, where price gouging takes effect?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment says, in order to qualify for the loans and Federal catastrophe fund under the bill, the various States would have to establish anti-price gouging laws for post-event materials, that's goods and materials that people need after a catastrophe. The amendment defines price-gouging as a supplier charging a price he knows is greater post-event than he charged pre-event, notwithstanding any reasonable business increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly, this kind of an amendment would help stem the double-whammy of a natural disaster. You might, for example, have your home damaged, and then when someone comes in to put a blue tarp on the roof, the price is outrageous, or even the delivery of goods and services after such a disaster. We need to protect homeowners from people who would rip them off, people who are simply trying to rebuild their lives after such an event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the Members to support the anti-price gouging amendment that is before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I would like to thank the gentlelady from Florida on this work on price-gouging. She and I served in the legislature in Florida and worked together with many others on price-gouging legislation. I don't think anybody can condone any kind of price-gouging in a natural disaster or at any other time, but certainly in a time of a natural disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the amendment to the amendment does is it provides some flexible language in the implementation of this. It certainly is something that we want to encourage States to move forward on as part of their eligibility, but recognizing we also want to make sure we're not creating impediments in terms of many States getting involved in the natural disaster consortium as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am in full support of this flexibility language, and that's exactly what the amendment does.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The gentleman from Florida, with whom I have worked so closely on this issue, and I obviously disagree. We disagree because I would like to have this as absolutely a mandatory part of participation, and he would prefer to have it as a suggestion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I still believe that we need to make this mandatory. It's like, you know, somebody once said, the Ten Commandments are now a suggestion, they're not commandments. I don't want to just suggest it; I want to make sure that the price-gouging language is strong so that we do protect people at that time of a natural disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most States do have good price-gouging laws already on the books. I'm not very happy with the term "encourage." I think we need to mandate this as part of the process.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I appreciate the work the gentlelady from Florida has done on helping us do this bill. And I agree with her that I am also concerned, and we are concerned in this legislation about price-gouging.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, the issue is what's the role of the Federal Government with regard to this legislation? And the problem that we have with her amendment is that what she is proposing is to define for each State the definition of price-gouging. And while we accept and support the idea of encouraging legislation, the problem is when you take the next step and you start defining what price-gouging is, it's a relative standard that may or may not fit the circumstance; and, so, therefore, it may  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H13359]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>

  <chair> Page 14, line 9, strike "and".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Page 14, line 14, after the semicolon insert "; and".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Page 14, after line 14, insert the following new subparagraph:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) the State or regional reinsurance program enters into an agreement with the Secretary, as the Secretary shall require, that the State will not use Federal funds of any kind or from any Federal source (including any disaster or other financial assistance, loan proceeds, and any other assistance or subsidy) to repay the loan;</chair>
  <chair> Page 20, line 12, after the period insert the following: "The Secretary may not accept any repayment of any loan made under this title that does not comply with the agreement for such loan entered into in accordance with section 202(b)(1)(C).".&lt;p&gt;</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400328" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it's good to be here joining my Florida colleagues on an issue of such great importance not only to the State of Florida, but to the whole country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we discussed during committee, I believe there is a role for a public-private partnership in managing risk. Whether it's a hurricane on the gulf coast, an earthquake or wildfire in California, tornadoes across the central plains, the truth of the matter is any catastrophe is a terrible experience for a State, a business, or certainly a family to endure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we're not here to just talk about any catastrophe. We're here to talk about mega-catastrophes, or mega-disasters, the kind of the scale and the scope that displace entire towns, entire regions for months, if not years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment, in my view, offers a commonsense protection for the taxpayers who are not affected by that particular disaster in holding participating States accountable for any liquidity or catastrophic loans that they may be eligible to receive should they experience this type of disaster that the private marketplace cannot cover, in which case they may seek this temporary financial assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment says that as a condition for a State to receive a loan, it is required to agree not to repay with Federal funds, and the Secretary of the Treasury has to enforce that agreement. If a State qualifies for a loan and then proceeds to get a liquidity or a catastrophic loan, they have to pay it back with State funds. They can't transfer Federal disaster money and then use that as a way of repaying what the Feds have given them. That is, essentially, double dipping.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I believe this amendment goes a long way to ensure that a State uses caution when entering into a loan for which that State is solely responsible for repayment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me state clearly that this legislation we are debating is not meant to, nor should it ever, alleviate a State of its fiduciary responsibilities, nor should it replace the private marketplace. Rather, it is meant to assist in those times of extreme damage and ruin when a State or the private market cannot meet the State's or region's capacity. I encourage any State that decides to participate in the consortium or has a qualified reinsurance program to work beyond the bill's scope and promote  greater mitigation, actuarially sound rates, and fiscal responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize that some of my colleagues have concerns about this, but I believe we are all trying to find the right balance. I believe that the sponsors of this have done their very best to find that right balance and move this public policy forward to the House floor, and I appreciate that. One of the things that make our country great is the way we all rise to the occasion in solidarity with our fellow citizens who are suffering when a major disaster strikes. Rather than expect the Federal Government  to save a State from all such liability, we should be encouraging those located in, high-risk, catastrophic areas to be better prepared for the inevitable. This legislation takes an important step forward toward that, and instead of expecting the Federal Government to take on that entire responsibility, we are working towards that partnership that allows for States to voluntarily participate in the program and finally bring them to the table as a true stakeholder.</paragraph>

SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the "Commission on Natural Catastrophe Risk Management and Insurance Act of 2007".</chair>
  <chair> (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act is as follows:&lt;p&gt;</chair>
  <chair>Sec..1..Short title; table of contents.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..2..Findings.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..3..Establishment.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..4..Membership.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..5..Duties of the Commission.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..6..Timing.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..7..Powers of the Commission.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..8..Commission personnel matters.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..9..Termination.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..10..Authorization of appropriations.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  The Congress finds that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) catastrophic hazards, including tornadoes, earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides, tsunamis, flooding, and hurricanes, directly affect hundreds of millions of people each year;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) during the 1990s, 2,800 natural disasters killed more than 500,000 people and directly affected 1,300,000,000 people worldwide;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) property damage from natural catastrophes has dramatically increased in recent decades, roughly doubling every seven years--a 14-fold increase over the past 40 years;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) risk costs have particularly soared in coastal areas, where hurricane frequency and severity has significantly increased, along with home values and building costs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) increased risk costs are being reflected in increased catastrophe insurance and reinsurance costs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) an inefficient legal and regulatory environment in some States has further exacerbated insurance cost increases, including through ineffective price controls, restrictions on capital movement, sub-optimal solvency regulation, and duplicative or unnecessary regulation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) consumers further suffer from temporary rate and availability volatility after  major catastrophes while the marketplace adjusts to the losses;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) government catastrophe mitigation requirements have been sub-optimal, sometimes ineffective, and uncoordinated;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) some State efforts to reduce insurance prices in catastrophe-prone areas have sometimes reduced long-term availability and competitive affordability of coverage, as well as subsidized excessive development in environmentally sensitive areas at the expense of taxpayers;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) several proposals have been introduced in the Congress to address the affordability of natural catastrophe insurance, but there is little consensus on the appropriate role of the Federal Government in facilitating the private insurance marketplace while avoiding cross-subsidies; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) therefore, an efficient and effective approach to assessing natural catastrophe risk management and insurance is to establish a nonpartisan commission to study the management of natural catastrophe risk, and to require such commission to report to the Congress on its findings before the next hurricane season begins.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There is established a nonpartisan Commission on Natural Catastrophe Risk Management and Insurance (in this Act referred to as the "Commission").&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 4.

DUTIES OF THE COMMISSION.</chair>
  <chair>  The Commission shall examine and report to the Congress on the natural catastrophe insurance marketplace, including the extent to which insurance costs and availability are affected by the factors described in section 2, which factors the Federal Government can and should address to increase catastrophe insurance availability and competitiveness, and which actions the Federal Government can undertake to achieve this goal without requiring a long-term cross-subsidy from the taxpayers. In developing  its report, the Commission shall consider--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) the current condition of, as well as the outlook for, the availability and affordability of insurance and reinsurance for natural catastrophes in all regions of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) the current ability of States, communities, and individuals to mitigate their natural catastrophe risks, including the affordability and feasibility of such activities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) the impact of Federal and State laws, regulations, and policies (including rate regulation, market access requirements, reinsurance regulations, accounting and tax policies, State residual markets, and State catastrophe funds) on--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) the affordability and availability of catastrophe insurance;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) the ability of the private insurance market to cover losses inflicted by natural catastrophes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) the commercial and residential development of high-risk areas; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) the costs of natural catastrophes to Federal and State taxpayers;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) the benefits and costs of--</chair>
  <chair> (A) a national, regional, or other pooling mechanism designed to provide adequate insurance coverage and increased underwriting capacity to insurers and reinsurers, including private-public partnerships to increase insurance capacity in constrained markets, including proposed Federal natural catastrophe insurance programs (specifically addressing the costs to taxpayers, tax equity considerations, and the record of other government insurance programs, particularly with regard to charging actuarially  sound prices);&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) improving Federal and State tax policy to allow insurers or individuals to set aside catastrophe reserves;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) directing existing Federal agencies to begin selling catastrophe insurance to individuals;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) creating a consortium of Federal and State officials to facilitate state catastrophe bonds and reinsurance purchasing as well as providing temporary Federal disaster loans to the States for insurance purposes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) expanding the Liability Risk Retention Act of 1986 to allow businesses to pool together to buy insurance and set up their own insurance funds;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (F) providing temporary Federal assistance to low-income individual homeowners whose catastrophe insurance rates have increased beyond a certain level after a major disaster, with the possibility that the assistance would be repaid upon sale of the underlying home;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (H) providing for limited Federal development and oversight of the sale of catastrophe insurance in high-risk areas during periods of relative unavailability; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (I) facilitating further growth of the catastrophe bond marketplace and other competitive alternatives to the traditional insurance and reinsurance marketplace;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) the present and long-term financial condition of State residual markets and catastrophe funds in high-risk regions, including the likelihood of insolvency following a natural catastrophe, the concentration of risks within such funds, the reliance on post-event assessments and State funding, the adequacy of rates, and the degree to which such entities have been actuarially solvent in comparison to comparably sized private insurers;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) the need for strengthened land use regulations and building codes in States at high risk for natural catastrophes, and methods to strengthen the risk assessment and enforcement of structural mitigation and vulnerability reduction measures, such as zoning and building code compliance;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) the ability of the private insurance market in the United States--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) to cover insured losses caused by natural catastrophes, including an estimate of the maximum amount of insured losses that could be sustained during a single year and the probability of natural catastrophes occurring in a single year that would inflict more insured losses than the United States insurance and reinsurance markets could sustain; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) to recover after covering substantial insured losses caused by natural catastrophes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) the impact that demographic trends could have on the amount of insured losses inflicted by future natural catastrophes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) the appropriate role, if any, for the Federal Government in stabilizing the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance markets; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) the role of the Federal, State, and local governments in providing incentives for feasible risk mitigation efforts.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 6.

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment would strike the text of the bill in favor of creating a blue ribbon commission to develop a full array of policy options that Congress could pursue to address the concerns of insurance affordability and availability in disaster-prone areas of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I introduced this language as a freestanding bill on a bipartisan basis with my colleague from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer). It would bring together 16 of the country's leading experts on catastrophe-related issues who would be tasked with studying the issue in depth, gathering information from a host of constituencies affected by natural disasters and then reporting back to Congress with specific and detailed recommendations for legislative, regulatory, administrative or other actions to  improve the natural catastrophe insurance marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The idea of this commission was originated by the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, the senior Senator from Connecticut, Senator Christopher Dodd. Just before the August recess, Senate Banking Committee reported a bill out of committee unanimously creating the Commission, and I hope it will be considered on the Senate floor soon. I would like to highlight a few of the duties we will task the committee with examining. The full list of duties is found on page 7 of my amendment  in section 5.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will ask the Commission to consider the current condition of, as well as the outlook for, the availability and affordability of insurance and reinsurance for natural catastrophes in all regions of the United States not just in some; the current ability of States, communities and individuals to mitigate their natural catastrophe risks, including the affordability and feasibility of such activities; the benefits and costs of a national, regional or other pooling mechanism designed to provide  adequate insurance coverage and increase the underwriting capacity to insurers and reinsurers; the need for strengthening land use regulations and building codes in States at high risk for natural catastrophes; and the appropriate role, if any, for the Federal Government in stabilizing the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance markets and the role of the Federal, State and local governments in providing incentives for feasibility risk mitigation efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard a host of arguments already today on the merits and drawbacks of the underlying bill proposed by my colleague from Florida. I happen to believe the underlying bill is an overreach that could potentially expose taxpayers to massive liabilities. I am mostly concerned about encouraging States to create qualifying State insurance funds which are likely to further crowd out the private marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems to me there exists a happy medium between those who have total confidence in the private marketplace to correct problems in the insurance market and those who believe the Federal Government must intervene to set the market right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should not underestimate the weight of our decisions to move forward with the underlying bill. Inserting the Government's hand into the insurance marketplace threatens to disrupt the interrelationship of risk mitigation; threatens to disrupt population growth and economic development in vulnerable regions; threatens to disrupt private insurance and reinsurance markets for catastrophic risk management; threatens to disrupt insurance rate regulation, and threatens to disrupt the role of State-run  catastrophic insurance mechanisms which are only beginning to be systematically examined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than rushing to vote on the underlying bill, I believe Congress should tap the growing body of knowledge and expertise that is now just coming together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is there are several proposals that have merit, and each would benefit from the kind of rigorous objective study that an impartial commission of experts could provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this amendment is a measured approach, an approach supported by the Senate, at least the committee, and urge my colleagues to support the creation of a commission on natural catastrophic risk management and insurance in lieu of the current proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to point out that the existing bill, besides likely not being supported by the Senate, has a veto threat  by the President because of the massive liabilities and the incredible disruption that this legislation may cause the insurance marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412197" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Connecticut for his amendment. I just want to make a couple of comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a problem that has been afflicting Americans now for over a decade. This Congress has looked at this problem for over a decade. For over a decade, this Congress has failed to do anything. And right now, as we are sitting here in the comfort of this great Chamber, there is a grandmother in Okeechobee, Florida, who has to sit down and write a check tonight to pay her mortgage, her insurance, and her property taxes. Let me just say this for all of the people, the millions of people right  now who are afraid that they cannot make that payment. The idea after a decade of do nothing to continue to recommend to do nothing is unconscionable. It is also unconscionable that when Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana and Mississippi, of the $110 billion bailout, that the people in the State of Connecticut coughed up $1.39 billion to pay off a disaster. This has to stop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the gentleman from Connecticut is trying to do is he is trying to kill this legislation with this amendment. He is trying to hurt the people in Okeechobee right now who are suffering, trying to figure out how to pay their bills. I would urge people to defeat this amendment because this is not the people's business. What we need to do is we need to act responsibly. We need to take care of people who should be able to live in their homes and afford their homes. Having a home and home ownership  is the American Dream. It is important that we protect it. The time has long passed, over a decade, the time has long passed for study. Today, this House has the opportunity to take action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would encourage my colleagues to vote "no" on this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am very fond of the gentleman from Connecticut, and I know his heart is in the right place. He has been very supportive of many of the things that are proposed in this Chamber, and on many, many issues we agree; however, this is an issue that we do not agree on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Study, study, study. Let's just study it again. That is what Congress has done for so many issues for so many years. Another colleague of ours, Jo Ann Emerson, came to Congress a little over 10 years ago taking her husband's place in Congress. He had passed away. The reason I mention this is her husband chaired a study group on this very subject in 1995 or 1996. How much longer do people have to believe that Congress is going to do nothing other than create another bound study that is  going to sit on somebody's bookshelf someplace and not accomplish one darn thing? This isn't just about Florida. It is about every State that faces natural catastrophes. It is about finally having a solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from Connecticut was elected to serve in the House. Quite honestly, there are many times when, on this very floor, we all say, I don't care what the Senate is going to do. Well, it just so happens that a bill recently was introduced, very similar to this bill, by Senator Nelson and a neighbor of the gentleman from Connecticut, Mrs. Clinton, Senator Clinton, so there is a companion bill over in the other House. While that companion bill is not bipartisan,  it is some movement. It is acknowledgement to the people out there who are paying outrageous insurance rates that Congress is finally stepping up and doing something and not just creating another study killing who knows how many trees. I know the gentleman from Connecticut is an environmentalist. I would think he would want to save a few trees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I disagree with the gentleman's amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to vote against it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412198" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, what has just been expressed by our colleagues from around the country is that this is a time for action on an issue that is well overdue. There have been many parts of the country that have been hit by this insurance problem for a long time. But I can tell you that whether you are in the State legislature, like I was in the past, or in the Congress, or in any local government, or even a lot of businesses, a lot of times when you want to study something and  you want to put it on the shelf and collect dust, it is not going anywhere. This particular provision, this particular idea sounds nice. It says, oh, we are going to study this and we're going to study that and have qualified people come together. Well, do you know something? That is what we have been doing. We have been bringing together qualified people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have spent a lot of time, bipartisan, a lot of experts in the field, consumer groups and experts on Wall Street and people in the industry to really figure out what is the right way to do this. Is this perfect? I don't know. But we have certainly tried to do what we think is common sense and we are moving in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The notion of studying it and coming back, and this particular provision says coming back on June 1 of 2008 with a report which will then be presented to the Financial Services Committee, which will then hold hearings and more hearings and more hearings, and then it will end up in the Senate, we are talking about 2015 before they even bring a bill up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, we have something here today that is a bill. It is an idea, a set of ideas that have been developed, and we are ready to move on it. And the people back home are ready for us to move it. They want action. They want relief from their insurance bills. They want to know as taxpayers there is a better way of doing this than the Federal Government writing a check every time. That is what this bill does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with all due respect to those folks who say, let's study it more, it hasn't been studied enough, yes, it has. It has been studied enough. And we will continue to study it when it goes over to the Senate. But we are looking to make a bill, finalize a bill here in the House today. Let the Senate take it up over the next couple of months and let's get some relief to the homeowners of the United States when it comes to their homeowners insurance.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say to my colleagues from Florida that I would probably be saying the same things they are if I was from Florida. And I would say them with all the sincerity that you are saying them and I would attack any proposals that took a different position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, we are capable in this Chamber of acting quickly. I do agree with my colleagues that it has been a number of years that we have done nothing. I don't agree that we have had the kind of study that we need and the kind of study that you would see in my proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what I would also say, for whatever it's worth, not that it's going to change votes, but I want to go on record that if such a study is ultimately passed because of the Senate, even if this Chamber doesn't pass my amendment, that I will go out of my way to fight for a bill to deal with this issue next year. That is just a commitment I want to put on the record because I don't think we can continue to wait.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What concerns me is I feel like in an effort to deal with the very real problem of Florida, we are going to screw things up for 49 other States, or 40, or 35, and that we are going to do something that a lot of Members don't want  to do and that is create huge liabilities for the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not suggesting that this is a perfect solution. My problem is I think the bill that is being promulgated by the Florida delegation is fatally flawed. I think if there was a study, we would come back with a proposal that would have similarities to this legislation, but not so negatively impacting the rest of the country and not providing the kind of potential liabilities to the tax payers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do respect what my colleagues from Florida are saying. I think they are fighting for their constituencies. But I think those of us who aren't in Florida have an obligation to step up and voice the kind of reservations that exist elsewhere throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, if this amendment fails and this bill passes as it is and is sent to the Senate and dies, or passes both Chambers and the President vetoes it so nothing happens, I will be on your side of the issue working with my Florida colleagues to deal with the issue next year.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I stand here before you as a Member of Congress not from Florida; in fact, from California. But I support this bill. If a tsunami were to hit Honolulu, there is not enough insurance base in the entire State for all the types of insurance there could possibly be to cover the effects of that kind of disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come from California, which is not a small State. It is in fact the largest State. But we have earthquakes. After the Northridge earthquake, you could not buy earthquake insurance pretty much from anywhere at any price in the entire State of California after that earthquake. So even in a large State like California you can have problems getting disaster insurance for various disasters, even today; and it has been a number of years since we have had any significant number of earthquakes in California.  The earthquake insurance, currently there's a State program to cover earthquake insurance and it vacillates between not providing very much coverage and being not actuarially sound.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I support this bill because we do need to look at tsunamis in Hawaii, earthquakes in California, hurricanes in Florida and tornadoes in Kansas, and ways that we can pool those risks. Now, if a disaster of any type hits any one of those States, as I mentioned, that earthquake or that hurricane or that tornado will not discriminate between single families' homes and apartment buildings or commercial property. The amendment that I offer today, Mr. Chairman, would add commercial property to this  bill because, as I said, the disasters don't discriminate. But also, when you think about it, if a hurricane hits, and I know the sponsors of this bill are very familiar with that, or an earthquake hits and an apartment building goes down, the people living in that apartment building need that apartment building rebuilt every bit as much as the people in the single family home need their single family home rebuilt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If jobs and economic activity are to be restored in the region hit by the disaster, then the businesses that were destroyed or severely damaged in that disaster also need to be rebuilt. So what this bill would do is it would not compel any State to include commercial property in their State program. But if a State chooses to include commercial property in their State program, then it could be included in the risk pools that will be set up as a result of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank the gentleman from California. Although we are from different parts of the country and sort of the extreme points of the country, we share, along with many people in other quarters of the country, the same problem; and it is a problem with dealing with these large-scale natural disasters which are difficult to predict and, at the higher end, difficult to insure. Whether it is mud slides or wildfires or earthquakes or tornadoes or major  floods or hurricanes or blizzards or any number of other things which cause very large-scale damage, we need to find a way to come together and resolve this, which is what, of course, this plan is trying to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the gentleman has proposed, and is something I think we should all recognize, is the fact that earthquakes don't distinguish between a house and an office building, or a house and an apartment building, or any other number of commercial or private structures. I think the notion here of trying to, again, pool interests is something that deserves a lot of attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to pose a notion to the gentleman. I know the Chair of Financial Services has mentioned that he would like to hold a hearing, because as we developed this, we were pretty close to certain this would work with the residential property community, and even put something in the bill at the gentleman's request about the multi-family properties as well, because I think that is a big issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As it relates to the broader issue, I think we want to continue to investigate this, to understand from the Congressional Budget Office's point of view, making sure that, as this does meet PAYGO, we want to make sure this continues to meet PAYGO; and I think if we were to adopt this amendment, I think there would be some question about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the gentleman would respond as to whether he would withdraw the amendment now, with the commitment, I think from chairman of the Financial Services Committee, to, number one, hold a hearing and bring all the necessary information together and continue to work on this, whether it is in this piece of legislation as it moves to the Senate, or we all work together on another piece of legislation to deal with the same issue.</paragraph>

  <chair>The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair> Under the rule, the Committee rises.</chair>
  <chair>Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Serrano) having assumed the chair, Mr. Cardoza, Acting Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (<bill type="h" number="3355">H.R. 3355</bill>) to ensure the availability and affordability of homeowners' insurance coverage for catastrophic events, pursuant to House Resolution 802, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted by  the Committee of the Whole.</chair>
  <chair> Under the rule, the previous question is ordered.</chair>
  <chair>Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amendment.</chair>

  <chair> The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.</chair>
  <chair>The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time.</chair>

  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative> Mrs. Capito moves to recommit the bill <bill type="h" number="3355">H.R. 3355</bill> to the Committee on Financial Services with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendments:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Redesignate sections 402, 403, and 404 as sections 403, 404, and 405, respectively.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; After section 401, insert the following new section:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 402. PROHIBITING CROSS-SUBSIDIZATION FROM MIDDLE AMERICA.</narrative>
  <narrative> Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a program shall not be considered to be a qualified reinsurance program for purposes of this Act unless the Secretary certifies that the program is not cross-subsidizing any geographic region, including by subsidizing coastal homeowners and developers at the cost of other taxpayers or policyholders.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> The gentlewoman from West Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400061" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MRS.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, valid questions have been asked about this, and this bill could make West Virginians and other taxpayers across America liable for what the bill says itself, hundreds of billions of dollars in loans and subsidized insurance to State insurance companies that are displacing the private sector and charging inadequate rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unclear how much this bill will actually cost the taxpayers. The Congressional Budget Office has said at least tens of millions of dollars if fully implemented, and it could have been higher by several magnitudes if they thought that States would actually use the provisions of the bill with any meaningful frequency. Now the manager's amendment has added up to 200 billion more dollars in taxpayer exposures that would not be repaid. There is no sunset on this bill, and this is a permanent  liability for the taxpayers. The hard facts are that the bill itself recognizes that taxpayers could be asked to cough up enormous sums of taxpayer dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another consideration is the environment. The National Wildlife Foundation and the Florida Coalition for Preservation oppose this bill because they say it "would result in continued encouragement of risky development in our Nation's coastal areas and floodplains. With more development in these environmentally sensitive areas, this bill could lead to more loss of life, property, and of wildlife habitat. The safety of our citizens should be the number one priority of any government program dealing  with natural disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration says that <bill type="h" number="3355">H.R. 3355</bill> would "displace the private market," "clearly result in a subsidy for insurers, State insurance programs, and their policyholders," "undermine economic incentives to mitigate risks," "be fiscally irresponsible as the Federal Government could expect to face steep losses in certain years," and that "financing these losses would require Federal taxpayers to subsidize insurance rates for the benefit of those living in high-risk areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this amendment simply says, if we are going to put taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars in loans Treasury will be forced to give under this bill, then we should also make a commitment that homeowners who do not live on the coast will not have to pay for this subsidy in the form of increased insurance rates. One group of taxpayers should not be compelled to cover the inherent costs of risky, high-priced coastal development for developers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without this amendment, homeowners, who are taxpayers too, would be hit twice. First, they would essentially guarantee these loans in the event States default, and according to Treasury, "it is more than likely that there will be significant pressures to forgive outstanding debt in the case of a huge catastrophe" and that "taxpayers nationwide subsidize insurance rates in high-risk areas, which would be both costly and unfair."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the extension of these loans will implicitly subsidize high-risk areas at the expense of other homeowners. When a State repays these loans, it could assess a fee or tax on all homeowners in the State, including those who don't receive the benefit of this subsidy. Also, the State insurance companies that stand to gain from this bill squeeze out private insurers, meaning less competition for consumers, higher prices, and fewer choices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>On October 10, a Wall Street Journal editorial put it this way: Congress is volunteering "middle-class taxpayers nationwide as the financial backstop for beachfront properties."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill does nothing to address the development and zoning that could be encouraged with these new programs. We can add mitigation and other requirements. The fact is, if the Federal Government is making something cheaper, you're probably going to buy more of it and do more of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, with this bill, we are giving a gift to coastal development and dysfunctional State agencies at the expense of Middle America. Homeowners all over the country have been hit hard lately; and for the millions of taxpayers who do not live in these areas, this bill would be another blow. My amendment simply ensures that we will be mindful of the vast majority of homeowners and taxpayers who, like West Virginians, do not stand to benefit from this bill at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MRS.">
    <paragraph>I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MRS.">
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown-Waite).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400051" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MRS.">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very much opposed to the motion to recommit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>States have comprehensive plans controlling development. What States don't want is the Federal Government telling them what to do. There are excellent new building requirements, new building codes that are in place to ensure that anything that has been built since 1990 is built to much stronger standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the insurance costs: let's face it, ladies and gentlemen, if this bill doesn't pass and a catastrophe happens, the first thing that will be the bill du jour is to bail out California if there is an earthquake, Florida if there is a hurricane, or any other State where tornadoes hit down. If you voted for TRIA because it was the right thing to do to stabilize the reinsurance market for terrorism insurance, then you should vote for the bill and against the motion to recommit. This is an attempt  to stabilize the insurance market; it is not an attempt to take over the insurance market.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MRS.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, first my friend from West Virginia said, well, we would be displacing the private insurance market. We have fellow citizens represented here who are trying desperately to find that private insurance market. This is hardly a case of our intruding in a perfectly functioning market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then the amendment bans cross-subsidies; it bans cross-subsidies that do not exist. The CBO report: "Assuming the appropriation of the specified amount CBO estimated in implementing this provision would cost $75 million over the next 5 years." That's the total on one provision. On the other provision: "CBO estimates that loans made under the bill would have an insignificant cost over the next 5 years. Enacting <bill type="h" number="3355">H.R. 3355</bill> would not affect direct spending or revenue." So there is no taxpayer  expenditure; so there is no subsidy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then as to cross-subsidy, it is very carefully worded. It says: "No cross-subsidizing in any geographic region." It doesn't say across State lines because that could not happen. No State is in this program unless it volunteers to get in. So now, apparently, the worry is that north Florida will subsidize south Florida. I think we leave that to Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One last point. Many of my colleagues have had this button, article I. This does not attempt to change the program substantively. It does not try to deal with the subsidies because they're nonexistent. It says: "The Secretary of the Treasury has to certify." It is a very disturbing provision. It gives to a Secretary of the Treasury, who might be ideologically opposed to this, the power to kill the program voted by both Houses of Congress. If it said the Secretary could make a report and we  would consider it, that would be one thing. But there is no taxpayer subsidy, according to CBO. There is no interstate involvement unless the States have volunteered to get in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then it says that these nonexistent hazards will stop the program. And it doesn't say, by the way, that the Secretary stops it if he certifies it's causing a problem. He has to certify the negative. He has to certify that it's not causing the problem. To give that kind of power to the Secretary on a carefully drafted bill that already says no subsidy, that bans any interstate involvement unless the States want to, is just a way to kill the bill. I do not think that it's fair to our colleagues  from Florida on both sides of the aisle who have brought this forward and colleagues from other States who may want to join.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The worst thing about this is the title: "Prohibiting Cross-Subsidization from Middle America." Well, the gentlewoman left out apple pie and the flag, but all of them are irrelevant to this bill. If Middle America doesn't want to be in this bill, it simply stays out of it. There is nothing here that would coerce any State to be involved. So Members can safely vote against this recommittal and know that Middle America will sleep soundly tonight without having to subsidize the State of Florida.</paragraph>
