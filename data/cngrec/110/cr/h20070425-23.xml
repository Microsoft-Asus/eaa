    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to cosponsor <bill type="h" number="1912">H.R. 1912</bill>, the Medicare Hearing Enhancement and Auditory Rehabilitation, HEAR, Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1912">H.R. 1912</bill> will provide for Medicare coverage of hearing aids and auditory rehabilitation services. Medicare is currently specifically prohibited from paying for hearing aids. The HEAR Act repeals this prohibition and directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to determine the most appropriate manner for Medicare to provide this benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hearing problems can make it difficult to understand and follow a doctor's advice, respond to warnings and hear doorbells and alarms. Hearing problems can also make it hard to enjoy talking with friends and family. All of this can be frustrating, embarrassing and even dangerous. It makes good sense to help these people better afford devices, treatments and other services that will improve their quality of life and increase their safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to cosponsor <bill type="h" number="1912">H.R. 1912</bill>.</paragraph>
