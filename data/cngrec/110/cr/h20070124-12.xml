  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I will reintroduce the National Right to Work Act. This bill seeks to end compulsory union dues and return to American workers their unalienable freedom of choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As ranking member of the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, this is an issue with which I am actively involved. No American should be forced to pay union dues to get or keep a job. Ironically, even proponents of compulsory unionism acknowledge that coercion is the central pillar of our current Federal labor law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By simply repealing certain provisions of the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor Act, we can abolish forced union dues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to introduce this bill with 51 of our colleagues, and I urge you to join us in increasing the freedom and prosperity of American workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
