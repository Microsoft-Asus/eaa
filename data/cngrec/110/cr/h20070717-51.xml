  <chair>The text of the amendment is as follows:</chair>
  <chair>Amendment No. 35 offered by Mr. Hensarling:</chair>
  <chair>At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following:</chair>
  <chair>None of the funds in this Act may be used for the South Carolina HBCU Science and Technology initiative (SC).</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this particular amendment would save the taxpayers $1.5 billion. This would  strike the funding for the South Carolina HBCU Science and Technology initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say at the outset that I have no doubt that good use could be made of these funds by this institution in South Carolina. Let me also stipulate I have no doubt that the gentleman from South Carolina, who has offered this earmark, knows far more about the good work they do at this institution than do I.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I do believe that it is critical that every single penny of Federal spending be put in the context of its impact, not only on the taxpayer, but of future generations. I think if you are going to lead, you have to lead by example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I wish we had the opportunity to come to the floor each and every day and debate what will happen to future generations if we don't alter the spending patterns that we presently have in Congress today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, the chairman of the Federal Reserve has recently spoken, "Without early and meaningful action to address the rapid growth of entitlements, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened with future generations bearing much of the cost."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A report from the Government Accountability Office, the rising cost of government entitlements are a fiscal cancer that threatens catastrophic consequences for our country and could bankrupt America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that principally our spending patterns are driven by entitlement spending. But as the late Everett Dirksen once said, $1 billion here, $1 billion, we are starting to talk about real money. By one estimation, we already have 10,000 Federal programs spread across 600 agencies, and it seems like week in, week out, we just add, add to those particular programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question I have here today again is when we look at this one expenditure, and, yes, earmarks are a small part of Federal spending, but I believe that they are a large portion of the culture of Federal spending. I am not religiously opposed to earmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, maybe good things can be done with this money. But looking at the fact that the Federal budget is going way beyond the ability of the family budget to pay for it, at what point do we say that maybe, maybe the Federal taxpayer shouldn't be asked to spend money that goes to, I believe in this case, a private college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, as I understand it, the funding would be used for math and science research at the respective institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, we have got some of these institutions in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. I am sure they could use the money at Eastfield College. I am sure they could use the money at Trinity Valley Community College. I am sure my alma mater, Texas A&amp;M University, which is not in my district, could use this money as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But out of the hundreds of thousands of institutions of higher learning, why are we deciding that the taxpayer is supposed to fund this one? Is there any good purpose, any good program, any good project in America that shouldn't receive a Federal subsidy? That's kind of the question that we have here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I see a group of earmarks that are going to institutions in Members' districts, and I reflect upon the fact that we are now on a collision course to either double taxes on the next generation, or, for all intents and purposes, have no Federal Government, save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, we have got to start saving the pennies. When we start saving the pennies, eventually, the dollars will take care of themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment and claim the time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would be happy to yield time to my colleague, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400075" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my chairman for giving me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fiscal year 2003, while I was a member of the Energy and Water Subcommittee, I requested an analysis of the Department of Energy funding, which had been historically received by historically black colleges and universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I met with the subcommittee staff to go over these numbers, I think it is fair to say that we were all shocked. At that time, Mr. Hobson was chair of this subcommittee, and he summoned me to his office, and we sat down to discuss these numbers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we found was that over the prior 5 years funding to these institutions by the Department of Energy had been somewhere around 6.8 percent of all of their funding to colleges and universities across the country. In that 5-year period, that number had dropped to 2.8 percent, and we decided that it would be good to take a look at whether or not this could be reversed. I want you to just think about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Less than 3 percent of the funding by the Department of Energy was going to these institutions, yet over 25 percent of all black students in higher education were attending these institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, my congressional district has seven, I would say to the gentleman from Texas, seven historical black colleges and universities, and he seemed to be discussing this amendment as if it were one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also say to the gentleman that in my congressional district, you will find the University of South Carolina, The Citadel, the College of Charleston, Columbia College, Francis Marion University. And I would say that as far as the University of South Carolina is concerned, in this same subcommittee, you will see some earmarks, if you please, I call it targeted funding, to that institution. Yet I would ask the gentleman why has he singled out the HBCUs with no attention given to the University  of South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would suggest to the gentleman from Texas that this funding, $10.5 million, is a very small investment for these students. I applaud the gentleman's desire to be a good steward of the taxpayers' money. But our suggestion is that his focus is misguided. This small investment will pay huge dividends to the constituents I represent, and I rise in the strongest objection to this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would just add, there is a number of amendments I have, not just simply those in the gentleman's district, I suppose I could be here all day speaking about them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might also add that I am pleased to have a historically black college in my district, Jarvis Christian College in Wood County, Texas. Last I looked they don't have any money in this particular bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the question again is, if we are going to help people with education, doubling taxes on the American families, which the budget resolution has done, which this bill is a part of, is no way to help an education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge adoption of this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400180" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me say this: as the gentleman spoke, this came about when I was chairman of the committee. We relooked at what we were doing for HBCU. I happen to have two in my district. These institutions are generally underfunded and generally don't have the ability to put the emphasis on science and technologies that many of us believe these students should have. This is an effort by the committee to direct that money so we can increase taxes and can increase funding to the Federal Government  and to other agencies by getting these people involved in science and technology. So I wholeheartedly support the committee's recommendation and would urge to vote down the amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to continue on somewhat with some of the themes that were touched upon in the last amendment. But before I do, I do want to say a few words about the overall bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to say that I think a lot of good work was done by the committee, by the chairman, by our ranking member. It is my understanding that the dollar value of the earmarks has declined substantially from the last bill. I am going to say that I view that as progress. But I also want to say that when we are approaching as a Nation a very nasty fiscal fork in the road, and in this institution unfortunately there is a nasty habit of just kicking that can down the road as I mix my metaphors;  but, again, don't take my word for it, look at the analysis of the Congressional Budget Office, look at the analysis of the General Accountability Office, look at the Office of Management and Budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just dealing with the government that we have today, if Congress just disappeared and created no new government, we are going to reach this fiscal fork in the road in the next generation, where we are either going to have to double taxes on our children and grandchildren, or for all intents and purposes there will be no Federal Government save Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not my analysis. Look at the analysis of these other bodies. And so I believe again that, unfortunately, although earmarks today are a small portion of the Federal budget, they are a large portion of the culture of Federal spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another reservation I have is my fear that too often they teach people and teach institutions to become dependent upon the Federal Government. I come from Dallas, Texas, and a part of the Fifth Congressional District takes in the eastern part of the City of Dallas. I was dealing not long ago, taking a tour with one of the very revered and esteemed medical institutions within the City of Dallas that said that for years and years and years they were always happy to competitively bid through the  NIH process or other processes for their research grant money. But they have awakened to the dawn of a new day now to where so many of their other competing medical education, medical research institutions were receiving their Federal funding via the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I believe that that is a bad thing, again, to try to somehow move away from what should be a more competitive process into one that does something else. Now, again, I think there is a lot of wonderful earmarks here. I have no doubt about it. But, unfortunately, more often than not we see earmarks representing a victory of the special interests over the national interests, a victory of seniority over merit, and too often a victory of secrecy over transparency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am glad that the Democrat leadership recently reversed themselves to allow the transparency that we see today, and I believe that that is a good thing. But two things we have to remember as we hand out money to one specific educational institution, and in this particular case the Environmental Science Center at the University of Dubuque. Maybe good things can be done with that money, but how about the good things that the taxpayers who fund this, how about the good things they could have done?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recently received some correspondence from a lady in my district, Joyce of Tennessee Colony, Texas: "Dear Congressman, please do what you can to stop the wasteful spending. I am retired; I am disabled. I am raising three grandchildren and now one great grandchild. I sometimes cannot afford my own medicine. It takes everything I have to get us from month to month. Gas has become a problem. I can't go to church at the end of the month because I don't have gas to get to town."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So here we are, Mr. Chairman, in an energy and water bill, and we are harming the energy program of American families to put energy earmarks in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Indiana is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400417" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would simply make the observation that for collectively the decisions made for congressional changes in the administration's request represent about 1 percent of the total funding for the Department of Energy in this bill, and they were very thoughtfully made. And whether they be, in this instance, in Dubuque, Iowa, or any other community around the United States, it is certainly the committee's position and belief that those investments are urged for the greater  good of everyone living in this country, and that is certainly to the advantage of every taxpayer in the United States of America.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to oppose the amendment by the gentleman from Texas, which would prohibit funding in the Energy and Water Appropriations bill for the new Environmental Science Center at the University of Dubuque in Iowa. When opened, this Center will provide State, regional, and national benefit through educating undergraduate and graduate level students in the environmental sciences, and helping to create the next generation of science professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The need for greater science education has received a lot of attention in recent years, and is an integral component of ensuring America's global competitiveness. As a Member of the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math Caucus, I believe strongly in the need for investment in science education, and I recognize the direct role that the Environmental Science Center plays in keeping America competitive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Dubuque has offered an interdisciplinary major in Environmental Science since 1980, with many graduates currently working in scientific fields. The environmental science program at the university is unique because of its hands-on focus and strict scientific training. In nearly every course, a field laboratory provides direct, applied experiences for all types of students. Furthermore, University of Dubuque's tri-state location affords students the opportunity to work with three  State natural resource agencies--Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Even as an undergraduate, students are able to receive a regionally based scientific education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new Environmental Science Center will allow the university to expand on its proven record of educating national scientific leaders. The Center will specialize in hands-on, applied learning for current science teachers, environmental agency personnel, undergraduate environmental science majors, and education majors to teach the next generation of American scientists. A failure to fund the Environmental Science Center would be a step backward for America's scientific proficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This funding is consistent with the President's goal to, "encourage innovation throughout our economy and to give our Nation's children a firm grounding in math and science." [President George W. Bush, State of the Union Address, February 1, 2006] America needs facilities like the University of Dubuque's Environmental Science Center to provide a grounding in science, and help move America forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly oppose the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas, because it will set America back in terms of global competitiveness and will endanger programs that will educate the next generation and allow them to  compete with the likes of China, Europe, Japan, and Asia.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).</chair>
  <chair>The amendment was rejected.</chair>
  <chair> The Clerk will designate the amendment.</chair>
  <chair>The text of the amendment is as follows:</chair>
  <chair>Amendment No. 37 offered by Mr. Hensarling:</chair>
  <chair>At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following:</chair>
  <chair>None of the funds in this Act may be used for the Emmanuel College Center for Science Partnership, MA.</chair>
  <chair> Pursuant to the order of the House of today, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, in specific, this amendment would strike the earmark that would fund the computer and science equipment at Emmanuel College Center for Science Partnership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, following up on some of the debate in the earlier amendments, I simply question why, at a time when our Nation continues to face great fiscal challenges in the future, that although these individual earmarks may be small amounts, I almost feel like the story of the three bears, whether the porridge is too hot or too cold. You come to debate spending on the floor, and sometimes people will tell you, well, that program is so big it is a sacred cow, you can't touch it. And then other times,  Mr. Chairman, you hear, well, we are dealing with a very small amount of money here, so why are we bothering with that? You almost believe it is part of the NIMBY syndrome, the "Not in My Back Yard."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, again, I will say I am sure the sponsor of this earmark knows far more about it than I do, knows far more about the educational institutional, and I have no doubt that good things could be done with that money. But that is not really the relevant question. The relevant question ought to be, number one, is this something the Federal Government ought to be doing in the first place, given all the other challenges and needs that we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second of all, is this a priority? Is this a priority? Because we know now that as, recently, Congress voted to increase the debt ceiling, continues to raid the Social Security fund. Is it worth taking money out of the Social Security trust fund to fund this particular earmark or any other particular earmark? And that is what Members have to decide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And although I am sure the sponsor of the earmark can make a very good defense and tell us all the wonderful good ways that this money will be used, and I am sure he will tell us that he knows his district better than anybody else, I stipulate that. I stipulate that. But, Mr. Chairman, I think I know my district, the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, better than anybody else in this institution; and I am fearful that every time the people of the Fifth Congressional District are called upon  to fund somebody else's earmark somewhere else across the Nation, because, again, as we are trying to fund Federal energy and water programs, we are taking away from family energy and water programs, including in many of those in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, I heard from Ken of Mabank, Texas. He was concerned about this single largest tax increase in the history that was passed as part of the Democrat budget. And as you spend more money, you have to tax more money. And so we know that the average American family in the next 5 years is going to be faced with an extra tax burden of about $3,000 a year, and part of it pays for earmarks like these. I heard from Ken in Mabank, and he said: "Dear Congressman, any increase in taxes will hurt  my family budget and cause us to cut back in other key areas. The rising gas prices have already made us cut back on spending. Why does the Federal Government continue to have an open checkbook based on the backs of the taxpayer, me?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I get letters like these every day, Mr. Chairman. And, again, we have to be cognizant as these so-called investments are made in Washington, we are taking away the ability of families including those in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas to make their investments in energy, their investments in water. And, again, I have no doubt that the sponsor of this amendment believes that good things can be done with the money, but is every good thing in America due to receive a Federal subsidy?  Shall we start to subsidize Girl Scout cookies? How about cut flowers in everybody's home? My children, who are age 3 and 5, are just now learning to swim. Maybe we should subsidize swimming pools in every community across America. Where does it all end? Where does the madness stop?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This kind of spending fuels the single largest tax increase in history and threatens, threatens, to double taxes on our children. I urge adoption of the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400063" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, several questions I guess I heard. Number one, about earmarks in general. I respect that. That is a legitimate debate to have. I personally thought I wasn't elected just to rubber-stamp the President's desires or his administration's; I was elected to also exercise judgment, judgment on behalf of my constituents and judgment on behalf of the people of America. One of the things I think is important is to educate the children of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This particular earmark goes to a private college that has entered into a private, private partnership with Merck to build a new science lab, to educate the children from, I would dare say, some of them might be from the Fifth District of Texas. This is a private university run by nuns. And, by the way, if Sister Janet ever called you and asked you for a favor, you would do it, too, if you had any brains, because I wouldn't say no to Sister Janet. So I don't know exactly what the debate is. This  particular one is to educate our own children in an merging field of biotechnology and other sciences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I know that some of the people that don't like this amendment also don't want us to bring people from overseas for those jobs. I question, where would they come from? Who will we hire? If we don't want people coming from overseas, which is a fair comment, and we don't want to educate our own children, where is the next generation of scientists coming from if we don't help?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is just another ploy to get some kind of philosophical opportunity to make marks. It doesn't help the country, it doesn't address the specific item at hand, it is just a way to make some television time; and I urge this amendment be defeated.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, now, I have never met Sister Janet, but I have heard from Melanie in Chandler, who said: "If I have to pay more taxes, then I can't afford to go to school." I have heard from Rose in Garland who says: "I am a divorced mother with a child in college. An increase in taxes would wipe out hope of the first college graduate in the family."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fueling earmarks like these take away from family education programs, Mr. Chairman. And that is why I urge adoption of the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I understand that people don't like to pay taxes. Neither do I, unless those taxes are used for wise and important purposes. And if the gentleman is so concerned about every taxpayer that doesn't want to pay taxes, then why are we still in Iraq?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amounts of money you are concerned with you said is a very small  amount of money. And it is, to you. It is not to Sister Janet and to the students at Emmanuel College. And if you are that concerned with it, all you have to do is just shut down Iraq for less than 30 seconds and you would have this money available to us. So I don't believe that the real concern is tax money, because if it were, we wouldn't be having this debate. We would be having  a debate on another matter that is much more financially irresponsible.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment would strike the earmark used to fund the equipping of two laboratories, creating 48 state-of-the-art work stations at Roosevelt University Biology Laboratory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, Mr. Chairman, there are so many great colleges, so many great universities across our Nation. How do we get into the business of subsidizing some and not subsidizing others?</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Again, there are many worthy colleges in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, Jarvis Christian College, Eastfield College, Trinity Valley Community College, and a much greater list beyond that. And so somehow, the students who attend those colleges in the Fifth District of Texas, either they or their peers are being asked to take money that would be destined for their education programs and send them somewhere else, in this case Illinois, to fund somebody else's education, somebody else's  research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I again stipulate that I have no doubt that good things could be done with this money. I don't know what. I'm sure the gentleman who sponsored the earmark would be happy to let us know the good things that can be done with this money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But too often, Mr. Chairman, we seem to forget whose money it is in the first place. And so that's why I bring these letters, this correspondence from people from the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, because we should never ever forget that as we're plussing up some Federal program, be it in energy or water or education, you're taking away from some family's program where they're trying to fund their energy, their water, their education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And again, Mr. Chairman, I just don't know how people can be aware of the fact that this Nation is on a collision course for a fiscal calamity. Just the government we have today threatens to double taxes on the American people. Now, a lot of those people today can't vote. Some of those people aren't even born yet. But we know it's going to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Go to the Congressional Budget Office. Go to the Office of Management and Budget. Listen to the Federal Reserve Chairman. Let me quote from some other sources. I quoted earlier from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, that without early and meaningful action, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened, with future generations bearing much of the cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CBO, either a substantial reduction in the growth of spending, a significant increase in tax revenues relative to the size of the economy, or some combination will be necessary to promote the Nation's long-term fiscal stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A famous economist, Robert Samuelson, the rising cost of government retirement programs, mainly Social Security and Medicare, increase taxes or budget deficits so much that they could reduce economic growth and this could trigger an economic and political death spiral.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so what I hear from too many of my colleagues is, well, this is just a few dollars in my particular district. Well, the challenge is great. The challenge is great. We must lead by example, and by leading by example, we shouldn't be bringing a bill to the floor, number one, that has a 4.3 percent increase over last year, 3.7 percent over the administration's request, and quite often they request too much, that I believe contains 5.6 billion in earmarks. Where does it all stop?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is this truly a Federal priority? Or should the priority be to assure that we leave the next generation with greater freedom and greater opportunity?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That fight starts today. I know too often the focus in the Nation's capital is on the next election and not the next generation. We ought to put it on the next generation because if we don't there'll be no money for them to fund their education programs. There'll be no money at all. And so we need to start today, and in this area of earmarking funds to these private educational institutions is a good start.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Indiana for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've listened rather intently all afternoon to the gentleman from Texas and his amendments. I've tried to find some logic. I've tried to find some validity. I've tried to find some argument. And, you know, for the sake of me, I have not been able to find any.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You can talk to any educators in America, and they will talk about the great need that exists for science teachers. You can talk to any medical schools, anybody really interested in health care, and they will talk about the need for scientists. You can talk to researchers. You can talk to people who try and keep us competitive with other nations, and they will talk about the great need that exists. You can talk to school districts who are importing science teachers from other countries because  we don't have an adequate supply here in the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then I hear the gentleman say, let's not fund these institutions. Let's not give the Roosevelt University, named for one of our great Presidents, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which provides opportunities for young people who would never, ever get the chance to go to college, to learn science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I can tell you that I still have not been able to find the logic of the gentleman's argument, other than to say let's not have earmarks. I'm sure that Jarvis Christian could use whatever resources that it could get, and of course it would have them if its Representative had requested and tried to get what they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I strongly oppose the gentleman's amendment, urge that it be voted down, down, down, as far down as it can get, and that we provide the opportunity for young people in America to fulfill the dream of a college education, a chance to earn a living, raise their families, make America the Nation that it has not been.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the $700,000 from the Department of Energy--Science account for biology laboratory equipment for Roosevelt University in Chicago, IL. Roosevelt University seeks equipment assistance for its biology laboratory which supports student and faculty work in cell and molecular biology. These subjects are integral to majors in the sciences, pre-health career programs, and science education. This request would equip 2 laboratories, creating 48 state-of-the-art workstations  and provide equipment for institutions advancing science and science education. The total cost of the project is  $6,000,000. Roosevelt University has partnered with the State of Illinois and local university funds are available for this project. This laboratory also supports the summer career pathways biotechnology program with Chicago Public Schools.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I'm not sure we're having a debate over how much money we're going to spend over education. We are certainly having a debate over who should do that particular spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm sorry that the gentleman from Illinois doesn't see the logic of American families who are working hard trying to save money, trying to put their children through college, and yet he has an earmark that is helping being funded by the largest tax increase in American history.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the amendment from the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).</chair>
  <chair>The amendment was rejected.</chair>
  <chair> The Clerk will designate the amendment.</chair>
  <chair>The text of the amendment is as follows:</chair>
  <chair>Amendment No. 39 offered by Mr. Hensarling:</chair>
  <chair>At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following:</chair>
  <chair>None of the funds in this Act may be used for Nanosys, Inc.</chair>
  <chair> Pursuant to the order of the House of today, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this particular amendment would strike the earmark for Nanosys, Inc. The funding would have been used to develop a fuel cell membrane electrode assembly to enable the production of lightweight fuel cells suitable for automotive applications and portable electronic devices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I have no doubt that that is a very worthy expenditure of funds. I, myself, prior to coming to Congress, used to be an officer in what most typically know is a green energy company.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The issues surrounding fuel cells, the issues surrounding making energy more environmentally friendly, making America more energy independent are very, very important issues. But I wonder, I wonder about the wisdom, about earmarking funds to a specific, which I assume to be, for profit company, a private company. Otherwise why are they called Nanosys, Inc.?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of companies across America, all trying to do good things, trying to feed our people, educate our people, clothe our people, heat their homes in the winter, cool them in the summer, help them with transportation. What isn't a priority here?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so now we give all the indication that, instead of having a company come and compete in some process, some kind of competitive bidding process, instead we have an earmark to a private company. Why is their fuel cell technology so superior to somebody else's?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back when I was affiliated with Green Mountain Energy of Austin, Texas, they were doing a lot of good things to produce power from wind energy and solar energy and biomass. Perhaps I should encourage some of my former colleagues of that particular private company to, instead of competing in the halls and competing in the marketplace, to come compete in the halls of Congress for an earmark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, again, this Nation desperately needs advances in fuel cell technology, but to start handing money, through earmarks, to individual companies, Mr. Chairman, I do not believe is the way to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And furthermore, once again we face such fiscal challenges. Our energy challenge, our educational challenge are not the only challenges we face. We face a great fiscal challenge. To paraphrase the Controller General Walker, he has said, we are on the verge, in America, of being the first generation in our Nation's history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>It has never been done in the history of America. And we will do that if we don't stop the ways that we spend the people's money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, again, I am faced with a bill here that spends 4.3 percent more than last year. I am faced with an earmark that is part of that process. I am looking at a Democrat budget plan, Mr. Chairman, that will be $21 billion over the President's request. I am looking at a Democrat budget resolution that is going to impose the single largest tax increase in America's history not only on the good people of the Fifth Congressional District of Texas but everybody. So, again, the relevant question is not  can good things be done with the money. I am sure Nanosys can do a lot of good things with the earmark that they will mostly likely receive. But it is coming out of American families. It is coming out of their energy budget. It is coming out of their education budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I urge adoption of this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400124" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for the very good work that he has done, all the members of the committee, because I know that you have to make difficult choices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to speak on the floor today about this investment in new technologies. As so many Members of the House know, I have the privilege of representing a congressional district that is the home of innovation and technology, high technology, biotechnology in our Nation. So perhaps the gentleman from Texas should come to visit because he would quickly come to respect what our country has come to rely on as well as our national economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that this is a small but very important investment, and it will make vehicles more fuel efficient. I think this is not only a value of the people of my congressional district but of the entire Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our country today is paying too high a price for not being fuel efficient, not being energy efficient; and to add insult to injury, we are depending upon our opponents and in some cases our enemies to supply us. That is a policy that I believe is on its head, and so I was pleased to request of the committee that we make an investment in this technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, what does it do? It develops a new type of cost-effective, energy-efficient fuel cell for automobiles. Now, fuel cells, we know that they can dramatically improve mileage per gallon, but the downside is that they require platinum, and platinum is expensive and it is in short supply. But it is needed because it is the catalyst for these fuel cells.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This particular investment actually will go a long way to dramatically increase the surface area of the platinum in a fuel cell. In other words, it will bring down the price. In fact, this project that I have requested funding for promises to produce a one-third cut in the overall cost of the fuel cell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we are respected around the world for the investments that we have made collectively, public and private, in new technologies. It seems to me that this is cutting edge, that it is smart, and that it is wise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to make two broader observations. Number one, when I listen to the gentleman from Texas, he registers the complaints from his constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know what? You don't have a corner on the market of constituents that care about how we spend money. Of course these things should be scrutinized. I welcome it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when there is an overall public good here where all of the American people win, not just my constituents from the 14th District in California or the gentleman's district in Texas but all Americans, that is a good investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number two, my constituents pay taxes, just like yours. And guess what? Californians don't get back everything that they send here. So are some things appropriate, good investments? We have to scrutinize that. But mine pay a fair share just as everyone else's do. As a matter of fact, California sends more than it gets back, which includes my constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would like to add a final point, and my mother used to say this, and now her words, I think, are truer than ever: "There are some that know the cost of everything but value nothing."</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I have listened intently to the gentlewoman's debate. I would simply say that it sounds too good to be true. If the company is on the cusp of making such wonderful breakthroughs, I just wonder, then, why taxpayer funds are needed. It would seem like investors would be knocking on the door to have a part of this great technology that this company is about to produce. I would love to sometime be able to visit California, visit this particular company, although I am  not sure how practical it is. And I would encourage the gentlewoman to come to the Fifth District of Texas and speak to the people who are having to pay for this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This particular amendment would eliminate all the earmarks in the bill, all 800 of them, all $1.1 billion of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I have two confessions to make about this amendment before I proceed  here. Confession number one is that the amendment is rather inartfully drafted. And the way it is drafted, it may actually catch some things, some elements of spending, that were not technically part of the 800 earmarks in the bill. But the reason for that is that the 800 earmarks are not actually in the bill. Something I would like to address later. But the amendment is drafted  the only way it can be drafted under the current situation, under the current process, to eliminate all of these 800 earmarks and $1.1 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second confession I would like to make is that one of those 800 earmarks that is in the bill is one I requested. Now, I believe a couple other Members requested it as well, but it is definitely one that I requested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So you may be asking why would I be proposing an amendment to eliminate an earmark that I requested. Do I suddenly believe that the earmark that I requested is somehow not valid or somehow not appropriate? No. Had I believed it was not valid or not appropriate when I requested it some months ago, I would not have requested it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the fact is, Mr. Chairman, that the process by which these earmarks happen stinks. And I believe that this process is terrible and that until we reform this process, we should eliminate all earmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that, Mr. Chairman, is why I offer this amendment to you today. It is not because I think that necessarily all 800 earmarks, including my own, in this bill are inappropriate. I do think $1.1 billion is more money than I would like to see relative to this or any earmarks. But it is because until we reform this process and have a process that works, I don't think we should do any earmarks at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The earmark process has, I believe, actually hurt not just Republicans and Democrats and not just taxpayers, but I believe it has hurt this institution. And I believe that is why Chairman Obey, the gentleman from Wisconsin, has expressed his own distaste for earmarks and the earmark process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let me make a few suggestions, 10 of them precisely, if I may, as to how this process might be reformed, how we might get it right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, put the earmarks in the bill. The reason we have had to draft this amendment so oddly is because the earmarks are not actually written in the text of the bill. If we are going to spend the taxpayers' money as Members of Congress on specific things, those specific things we are spending it on should be in the language of the bill that appropriates those expenditures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, let's have full disclosure of all the earmarks in the bill and let's have it at least a week before the vote. I think we got the list of these earmarks last, I think it was, Thursday or Friday, and here we are debating these today. There are 800 earmarks in this bill. It is a little tough for us or anyone else to go through 800 earmarks in just a couple of days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, let's have full disclosure of all earmark requests. Every earmark in this bill in theory has a certification from the Member who requested it claiming what they have requested and why and also claiming that they have no financial interest in that earmark. Let's make those public. Those were turned in, I can't remember exactly whether it was February or March. I think it was March. Why should those be under some secrecy? Why should all those earmark requests not be available to the public?  And when we have full disclosure of earmarks, let's have real disclosure of earmarks. The disclosure that we got last week was one list that has the earmark amount and the project and another list that has the project and the Member requesting. So if you want to take the Member requesting and match it up with the amount, you have to match up the two lists somehow. Now, if there are only 10 earmarks, you could do that. But with 800 it is really hard</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Obey has suggested that Members often feel like they are ATMs. That is what this earmark process does. It diminishes, I think, the value of all of us that serve in this institution. We are here to make public policy. We are not ATMs. I was stunned when, in my first few months as a Member of this House, 70 different people came into my office not asking for a certain element of public policy, not encouraging me to support this or that or the other, but asking for money, asking for  earmarks, because they saw Members of Congress as an ATM.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number four, we should not have any earmarks for programs that are not authorized; otherwise, why do we bother to authorize programs? If we are not going to go through the process of authorizing a program, then earmarks can come in and be about anything. I think that is what you have seen in some of Mr. Hensarling's and Mr. Flake's objections is that earmarks have become about almost anything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number five, we should not have earmarks that do not serve a Federal interest and have a Federal nexus. This is Federal taxpayers' money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>There are many great needs out there in cities, counties and States, but cities and counties and States have sources of revenue. It's not like we don't have enough to do here. It's not like we don't have other things that we could spend the money on. God forbid we might give it actually back to the taxpayers. But even if we weren't going to do that, there are obviously plenty of truly Federal priorities that we should not be fixing sewers and other things like that, which are clearly local priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six, we should not be including earmarks that are requested outside of the State of a Member of Congress. Now, the point of these earmarks is to direct funds for things that our constituencies need. Why would we ever be wanting to direct funds for things that some other constituency needs? We know why. It's because some lobbyist or something somewhere requested it. So let's not be requesting or honoring earmarks that are outside of one's State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seven, we shouldn't be giving earmarks to private entities without some kind of a competitive bidding process. You know, if other elements of the Federal Government were to award contracts for millions of dollars to private entities without some kind of bidding process, we would complain about it here. And we do complain about it when we see it, and we should complain about it when we see it. But yet under this earmark process, many earmarks are given directly to private entities without any  competitive bidding process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eight, conference reports should never increase an earmark. Now, everything we could do here in the House to disclose and provide sunshine for earmarks could be null and void if you simply can drop earmarks into a conference report that were not in either the House or the Senate version of the bill. So we should never have earmarks coming back to this floor that are more than the amount that was in either the House or the Senate version of that bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nine, earmarks should be available for discussion at a hearing. We're spending the public's money. It should be exposed, what we're doing; it should be clear to people what we're doing; and we should talk about it and be willing to stand up and defend it, or not do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ten, when we eliminate earmarks, the money we save should go into debt reduction. It should save the taxpayers' money. It should go to reduce the Federal deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now unfortunately, if this amendment were to pass, I would love to tell you that the $1.1 billion to the taxpayers would be saved, but the way the rules are, it would take another amendment, a subsequent amendment to then save that money for the taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Culberson of Texas offered an amendment in the Appropriations Committee to change that rule so that if we do strike and/or eliminate any number of earmarks, that that money saved is actually saved, that it goes to debt reduction. But that amendment was defeated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Chairman, those are 10 things that could put sunshine on this earmark process. But we are a long ways  from that sunshine. We are a long ways from that accountability. We are a long, long ways from all these earmarks being visible, justifiable and, in fact, justified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So until then, I have made and will continue to make proposals to eliminate all the earmarks in any bill regardless of whose they are, myself included, or others, until we reform the process.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would like to thank my chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have put together, I think, a very good bill. This bill is $31.6 billion. The earmarks and the directed spending in this supplemental we're talking about today is about 3 percent of the bill, it's $1.09 billion. There are 777 projects. This includes the plus-ups to the administration's request. In some cases the administration asked for some money, we decided it wasn't quite enough to finish off something, so we added money to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me talk a little bit about the Corps. The administration requested $4.08 billion for 837 projects. The House adds $777 million for 466 projects. There are no new authorizations or new starts. And sometimes the President asks for new starts, Members ask for new starts; we don't have enough money to do new starts, so we stopped new starts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The earmarks are 14 percent of the total Corps' budget. I might add, when we started with the Corps of Engineers, the Corps didn't have a 5-year development plan, they had no vision of where it really wanted to go. It didn't come from the administration to change that, it came with the chairman and myself working together. We changed that in the Corps. That didn't come out of the administration, those nameless people down there who somehow figure out how they're going to spend the money. At least  here we know who's spending the money and we know the projects that we're looking at.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title II. The administration requested $551 million for 146 projects. The House added $72 million for 47 projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In DOE, in title III, the House adds $246.5 million for 263 projects. This represents less than 1 percent of the total DOE budget, which is $32 billion. This is a 50 percent cut to the fiscal year 2006 level. And I might say on the Republican side, it is now a 40 percent split versus the 60 percent as the majority changed. I think we've done a good job at looking at people's needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me give an example. In my State, ODOT is the big highway people, and they always want to do these big projects. And when I want to do something in my town that really impacts people within my city, they don't have time to do it. And even when I do an earmark, they fight me on the earmark because they want to do the big deals. They want to do the big projects that cost a lot of money. And they take care of people, too. But at the local community, I think sometimes we are better off at what  we want to do versus what the large agencies want to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to thank the chairman, and frankly, the staff, who has looked through all these projects. We've looked through all these projects. We've vetted these projects. And we've done as good a job as I think we can in looking at them. And we're not the technical people, but the staff is more technical. We've gone back on the Corps projects and talked to Corps of Engineers and said, do these projects make sense? Are they executable? Can we get them done? And they've come back and said yes. So  we have had a review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this is a well done bill. I think the earmarks are essential to Congress doing its oversight. I wish, frankly, we could work better with the administration on their earmarks. We don't know what they're going to do. They don't come and talk to us. Even in the hearings, we have no idea where they're going to spend all their money on the projects they want.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it would be a better process if we could all work together and have more transparency, and did more things at the local level. And we could take out a lot of the bureaucracy that exists in those huge bureaucracies that we tend to fund without anybody ever questioning how much money they're spending there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I don't want to pay more taxes either. I think the projects here that we do help the quality of life within the communities where we live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the bill. I'm opposed to this amendment. And I would request that Members oppose this amendment.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for this wonderful amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today out of a concern for what earmarks are doing to this body. Those of us on the Republican side understand very well the perils of unfettered earmarks. It's part of the reason we're squarely in the minority today. But there are greater concerns than which party is in the majority. I hope that each of us, Republicans and Democrats, would recognize this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Proponents of earmarking defend the practice by noting that Article I of the Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse, and that earmarking is consistent with that responsibility. It is true that Congress has the power of the purse. But the contemporary practice of earmarking circumvents, rather than enhances, the careful execution of our responsibility as stewards of the public purse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Take the Labor-HHS bill that will be coming up later today; it contains 1,300 earmarks. Are we to assume that each of these 1,300 has been properly vetted and scrubbed? No way. I suspect that, just as the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee noted a couple of weeks ago, there is no way to adequately screen these earmarks given the tight appropriations schedule. The question needs to be asked, why are we so bent on moving forward with 1,300 earmarks?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I should note that last year there were no House earmarks in the Labor-HHS bill. The world didn't come crashing to a halt. The year before there were no House earmarks in the Labor-H bill. The planets are still in order today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why are we so bent on moving forward when we can't adequately vet these earmarks?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps the most frequent justification for the contemporary practice of earmarking is that "Members of Congress know their districts better than some faceless bureaucrat in Washington." Now, I'm not here to defend faceless bureaucrats. They waste a lot of money in my district, as well as others. Faceless bureaucrats in Federal agencies waste so much money that somebody needs to be constantly looking over their shoulder and providing oversight. That's why we're here. But let's face it, when  we approve congressional earmarking for indoor rain forests in Iowa or teapot museums in North Carolina, we make the most spendthrift faceless bureaucrats look frugal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Excess by Federal agencies does not excuse congressional excess. If Federal agencies don't follow the procedures requiring competitive bidding or other processes, then we should cut their funding and/or mandate that they change their practice. We shouldn't try to one-up them with equally suspect appropriations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as an aside, we saw just a couple of weeks ago that the majority of this Chamber chose to deny funding for one particular earmark. Now, for the Record, it was my amendment to cut funding for the "Perfect Christmas Tree Project." There was no Federal nexus, and I didn't think it was a wise use of Federal dollars. But it was no less worthy than hundreds of projects funded by the same legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The distribution of earmarks is based on politics, not policy. Most appropriation bills award 60 percent of the earmarks to the majority party and 40 percent to the minority party. Is there a policy reason for this allocation that has reversed with every legislation? Are well-positioned Members who award themselves with more earmarks than rank-and-file Members more deserving? Are their districts more  needy? In some appropriation bills, each member of  the committee is given an equal share. Are we to assume here that these districts have exactly the same needs?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth is, we can try all we want to to conjure up some noble pedigree for the contemporary practice of earmarking, but we are just drinking our own bath water if we think the public is buying it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems that over the past few years we've tried to increase the number of earmarks enough so that the plaudits we hear from earmark recipients will drown out the voices of taxpayers who have had enough. It hasn't worked, thank goodness. For every group that directly benefits from earmarks, there are hundreds who see it as a transparent gimmick to assure our own reelection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, our constituents deserve better. This institution deserves better than we're giving it. Let's return to the time-honored process of authorization, appropriation and oversight that has served us well for so long.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would reserve the balance of my time, understanding I have the right to close, and I will be the final speaker on our side.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, Mr. Flake said it very well. This House can do better than this earmark process. We can do better than what is going on. Their earmarks have led to some of our colleagues who are now in jail. It has led to other problems with other colleagues. Let's reform it or get rid of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is the beginning of that process. And Mr. Chairman, I would urge Members, even if they have earmarks in this bill, to support the beginning of reform or elimination of what has hurt this institution and has hurt taxpayers so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400417" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the time and will begin my remarks in opposition, first of all, by again thanking my friend and colleague from Ohio (Mr. Hobson), all of the members of the subcommittee, and the staff, who have done a very good job on this bill and improved the circumstances for people's safety, health, security and employment opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to make a couple of points. The first is, we've heard a lot about the expenditures that are enumerated in this legislation, and that certainly is worthy of debate. What has been lost today, but was covered earlier this year when the bill originally was on the floor, is the fact that there are significant cuts that have been made in this bill to programs that we felt could be either eliminated or reduced because they did not have the same value and merit as those contained in the  legislation we're considering today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would note that there were 37 different DOE weapons programs that were cut. There were an additional 20 programs, two in the Army Corps of Engineers, two in the Bureau of Reclamation, three within the independent agencies, and 13 others in the Department of Energy that were reduced because we did not feel that they cut mustard and did not make the same significant contribution to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>As far as our infrastructure, and I would want to focus on that for a few minutes, the investment in our water infrastructure, for example, in this legislation represents a little bit less than 20 percent of the overall spending. But I would note that in 2005, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimated that nearly 50 percent of the Corps of Engineers-maintained locks are functionally obsolete using a design life of 50 years. Many of our communities do not enjoy the benefit of adequate  flood protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We think of moving the commerce of this country. We think of people's safety. We are woefully behind. There are numerous channels and harbors throughout our Nation, across this country, that are not maintained at usable depths, much less at the authorized levels. Again, for every ship that uses a channel or a harbor not at depth, they are coming in and they are leaving lighter. That is less efficient as far as the economy of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Corps of Engineers' backlog is $50 billion. One thing that I would note for the membership here is that during the last several years under Mr. Hobson's leadership as chairman, one of the things that we have tried to do is, if you would, to focus funds on some programs to meet that backlog, to make sure that some projects ultimately are completed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also point out that the committee is mindful of the responsibility that we all have in Congress regarding ensuring that Federal funds are spent in a responsible manner. This committee has been at the forefront of changes to the fiscal management of the Corps of Engineers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In light of the challenges involved in modernizing this Nation's water resources infrastructure, we have required, again, over the last several years, a more disciplined and rigorous approach to fiscal and contract management by the corps. This bill continues financial management contracting reforms to ensure that the corps manages its budget in the best interests of the taxpayers. The recommendations include directing that the corps continue to take action in considering additional factors as  they proceed in the planning of projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Outside of water infrastructure, we do have the Department of Energy that encompasses obviously more than three-quarters of the spending in this bill. As was noted when we brought the bill to the House floor, regrettably, as a citizen, as a public official, I would note that since 1990, the Department of Energy has been on the high-risk list of the GAO for project management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is all of our money. One of the things that we have, again, attempted to do in this bill is to begin to force the issue with the Department so these major construction projects are brought in on time and on budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned, and I will close on this note, in my remarks at the beginning of the debate, we started today, the money spent in this bill, whether they were enumerated originally by the administration or by the Congress, are investments, investments in our national security and in the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons. They are investments in our energy security, which is now in economic crisis, a national security crisis and an environmental crisis. We have increased funding for  biofuels. We have increased funding for vehicle technology. We have increased funding for renewable energy research. I am proud of the subcommittee's work in those areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have made investments in the health of our people, in that if you have clean water to drink, you are going to enjoy good health. If you do not, you are going to become very sick. We have also looked at the health of those citizens around our country who live in and around former weapons sites and the nuclear cleanup that is going to unfortunately still take decades to accomplish. These are investments in the safety of our citizens. Think about those dams in this country. Think about one of  those locks failing. Think about the gentleman in Highland, Indiana, who lost his life when the Little Calumet River flooded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are investments to create a climate and to build the infrastructure of our Nation that encourages the development of new, well-paying jobs. To the extent we have made changes in the administration's priorities, whether they be by earmarks or changes in programs, those changes have been to enhance the effectiveness of the programs in this bill and to complement them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, for all of these reasons, I certainly am opposed to the gentleman's amendment, I would ask my colleagues to oppose it, and I would ask for my colleagues' support of the underlying legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell).</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400180" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400180" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette) for such time as he may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400235" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank the distinguished ranking member for yielding, and I want to thank the body for its indulgence as we wrap up this important debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to describe and discuss an amendment I was going to offer but did not and some of the reasons for it. Contained in this bill is a $2 million earmark for the Parker Hannifin Company of Cleveland, Ohio, for the hybrid drivetrain program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not going to offer the amendment for three very important reasons. One is the earmark was requested by my good friend and neighbor, Congressman Tim Ryan; two, in doing research on the hybrid drivetrain program, it is a good one, and three, Parker Hannifin is a great company that I am going to talking about in a minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But my amendment would have redirected the $2 million from the hybrid drivetrain program to their plant in Eastlake. Parker Hannifin has announced their intention in the near future to close a plant in Eastlake, Ohio, and cause the loss of 177 jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of the folks that work there have been working there for a number of years and are members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. But I want to talk a little bit about Parker Hannifin and why I am not offering the amendment and then have a request at the end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Parker Hannifin Company was started in 1918 by a guy named Arthur Parker. Just to show you how some of our entrepreneurs have had tough experiences, in 1919 there was a truck accident that wiped out the entire inventory of the company, and he had to go back to another job. He started again; and at the height the Depression, he bought an auto plant in 1935 in the City of Cleveland, and then during the height of World War II, employed 5,000 people in Cleveland, Ohio, supplying the war effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The war ended. Mr. Parker died. Again, the defense contracts dried up. It looked like there wasn't going to be any progress for the company. His widow said no, and they continued to reinvest in northeastern Ohio and northeastern Ohio continued to reinvest in them and they rewarded them as well. Today, they are a $10 billion company employing 50,000 people worldwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My simple request is, I am not going to ask to redirect this money to the plant in Eastlake, Ohio, but as this bill moves forward, I would hope that we can continue to talk to the folks in Cleveland and Parker Hannifin, because if you think about this $2 million, some of those 177 machinists who potentially will lose their jobs paid into the Federal Treasury some of the money that comprises this $2 million that is going to the hybrid drivetrain project, and I hope that we are able to resolve  this in a way that we not only have the new technology for fuel efficiency that comes from the hybrid drivetrain technology, but given northeastern Ohio's solid commitment to this company since 1918, that they take that into consideration as we move forward and they make tough decisions in this global economy as to whether or not these jobs remain in northeastern Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I very much thank the ranking member and the chairman for their indulgence.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400417" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, if my colleague would yield for a moment, I certainly appreciate the gentleman striking and yielding the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I understand and appreciate the gentleman's concern and his passion about this. Obviously, I cannot make any representations, other than I would want to stay in touch with both gentlemen and see what can be done and to work closely with you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I appreciate again the circumstances you find yourself in and would be happy to try to work with you.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400180" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank both gentlemen for their comments, and I yield back my time.</paragraph>

  <narrative> This Act may be cited as the "Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2008".&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400160" topic="NOT VOTING--9">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleagues, my good friend from Indiana and chair of the subcommittee, Mr. Visclosky, and Chairman Obey, for bringing up this important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the supplemental report on <bill type="h" number="2641">H.R. 2641</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the subcommittee leadership for their inclusion of $18.3 million for the Houston Ship Channel Navigation project, which is $2 million more than the President's budget, and for including $15.442 million in operations and maintenance  for the Houston Ship Channel, which is $1 million over the President's request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I understand the tight fiscal constraints this Congress is under, I hope we increase funding for these projects in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The continued O&amp;M funding would be used to keep the channel at its authorized depth, which is critical to keeping the channel navigable for the tankers that bring in crude oil to our refineries. The navigation funding goes towards important environmental restoration work in the deepening and widening project. We are at the end of that project now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our area relies heavily on Corps of Engineers' funding, since we're not only an energy-producing area but also a low-lying area in the middle of a flood plain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I requested funding through the Army Corps of Engineers for Greens Bayou, Hunting Bayou and Halls Bayou, which were flooded during Tropical Storm Allison in 2001. These authorized projects are located in blue-collar residential areas in my district, where the threat of future flooding is all too real.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful the subcommittee included $588,000 for Greens Bayou, which will help conclude the study portion of the project and now the project is fast approaching its construction phase. The Greens Bayou project has a high 3.7 benefit to cost ratio, and in 2001, over 15,000 homes in this watershed flooded in Tropical Storm Allison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the committee's continued understanding of the pressing flood control needs in our area, but am disappointed only Greens Bayou received funding in this appropriations cycle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hunting Bayou has already started construction and a cut-off of Federal funding threatens to put this project into danger of falling further behind schedule. Fortunately, this is a 211 (f) project which provides the local sponsor--the Harris County Flood Control District--flexibility to continue work on the project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Hunting Bayou project will reduce the number of homes and businesses in the 100-year flood plain by 85 percent, from 7,400 structures to 1,000. Eight thousand homes flooded in this area during Tropical Storm Allison as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also hope Halls Bayou will receive funding in the future; this project is authorized in WRDA 1990 and is included in the pending WRDA legislation to become a Sec. 211(t) project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Greens Bayou, Hunting Bayou, and Halls Bayou are not projects to protect vacation homes or homes in obvious flood hazard areas. Most of these areas were outside the flood plain until upstream development expanded the flood plains.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I want to commend the Chairman, and especially my good friend from Texas, Congressman Chet Edwards, for their hard work on this legislation, and hope they will continue their progress on funding critical needs across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the supplemental report.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400376" topic="NOT VOTING--9">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, in accordance with House earmark reforms, I would like to place into the record a listing of the Congressionally-directed project in my home state of Idaho that is contained within the report to this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The project provides $4 million within the Army Corps of Engineers Section 595 program for rural water infrastructure upgrades in Idaho communities. The funding was authorized in the Water Resources Development Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This funding is critical to assisting rural Idaho communities in upgrading their water and wastewater treatment facilities. In many cases, this funding is required to comply with unfunded mandates passed down by this Congress and federal agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps the most striking example of why the federal government has a responsibility to assist these communities is the burden the EPA's revised arsenic standard is having across America. In addition, these funds help rural communities in Idaho trying to attract new businesses and spur economic development. The vital water funding in this bill will assist rural communities in job creation and affordable housing by offering improved services at lower costs than would otherwise be possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm proud to have obtained this funding for Idaho communities and look forward to working with them in the future to meet their water resource challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the opportunity to provide a list of Congressionally-directed projects in my region and an explanation of my support for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1. Rural Idaho Environmental Infrastructure, $4,000,000.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400031" topic="NOT VOTING--9">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2641">H.R. 2641</bill>, the Energy &amp; Water Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007. I applaud our colleagues on the Energy &amp; Water subcommittee for producing a bill that fully funds some of this nation's most important basic research under the Office of Science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, I commend chairmen Obey and Visclosky, ranking member Hobson, and my fellow Long Island colleague, Mr. Israel, for their tireless support of ground-breaking research conducted at Brookhaven National Laboratory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm proud to represent BNL and the talented scientists who keep our nation at the cutting edge of basic research with projects like the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, which helps scientists unravel the big bang theory to explain the origins of our universe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fully funding this research will avert the same kind of uncertainty that threatened to derail it last year. Preserving BNL's status as a leading research institution will hopefully result in more decisions like yesterday's announcement that BNL will be the permanent home of the NSLS II, which uses intense light for x-ray imaging.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to commend the committee for allocating $7 million for the Fire Island to Montauk Point project, which would protect 83 miles along Long Island's south shore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, fully funding these research and infrastructure priorities are good for this nation and our economy. I am proud to support <bill type="h" number="2641">H.R. 2641</bill> and again commend our colleagues for a good bill and their hard work.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400417" topic="NOT VOTING--9">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise and report the bill back to the House with sundry amendments, with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The motion was agreed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. McNulty) having assumed the chair, Mr. Tierney, Acting Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (<bill type="h" number="2641">H.R. 2641</bill>) making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes, he reported the bill back to the House with sundry amendments,  with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Under House Resolution 481, the previous question is ordered.</chair>
  <chair>Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros.</chair>
  <chair>The amendments were agreed to.</chair>
  <chair> The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.</chair>
  <chair>The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time.</chair>
  <chair> The question is on the passage of the bill.</chair>
  <chair>Under clause 10 of rule XX, the yeas and nays are ordered.</chair>
