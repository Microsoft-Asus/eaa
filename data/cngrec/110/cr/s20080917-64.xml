  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="Introducing S. 3505. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for the coverage of home infusion therapy under the Medicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3505">S. 3505</bill>] Mr. President, today I join my colleague, Senator LINCOLN of Arkansas, to introduce the Medicare Home Infusion Coverage Act, which will help us improve care and reduce costs. Today we know that the average Medicare beneficiary must shoulder nearly half their health care costs. At the same time Medicare faces serious fiscal challenges. Currently, the Part A, hospital, Trust Fund faces insolvency in 2019, when expenditures will exceed projected contributions and require additional  taxpayer support to maintain the care our seniors and so many disabled Americans require.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is another way, and that is to reform care delivery to emphasize high quality, lower cost care. Today the many serious conditions--including some cancers and drug-resistant infections--require the use of infusion therapy. Such treatment involves the administration of medication directly into the bloodstream via a needle or catheter. Specialized equipment, supplies, and professional services (such as sterile drug compounding, care coordination, and patient education and monitoring) are part  of such therapy. The course of infusion treatment often lasts for several hours per day over a six-to-eight week period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The unfortunate fact is that Medicare patients requiring infusion therapy must either bear that cost themselves, or endure hospitalization in order to receive coverage. Though Medicare pays for infusion drugs, it does not pay for the services, equipment, and supplies necessary to safely provide infusion therapy in the home. Not surprisingly, even though home infusion therapy may cost as little as $100 a day, too few seniors can bear that cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The result is that patients are hospitalized needlessly, driving costs of treatment as much as 10-20 times higher than treatment in the home. That is wasteful to Medicare and may even place the patient at risk. That is because unnecessary hospitalization places individuals at risk of acquiring a health care-acquired infection--one which is frequently drug resistant and can be life-threatening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Private health plans have long understood that home infusion therapy is not only less costly, but safer as well. Thus private coverage for home infusion therapy is common. Private plans also recognize that patients benefit from avoiding hospitalization. At home they have familiar, comfortable surroundings, and family conveniently at hand--no small concerns when fighting a serious illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear we must change the status quo, and achieve safer, most cost-effective treatment. By extending coverage of infusion therapy to the home, we will correct this unintended and unnecessary gap in Medicare coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues will join us in support of this legislation so we may further the goals of improving patient safety and reducing our escalating health care costs.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300061" topic="Introducing S. 3508. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Education to make grants to support early college high schools and other dual enrollment programs; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3508">S. 3508</bill>] Mr. President, today I am doing my part to end the growing crisis of high school dropouts. I am introducing the Fast Track to College Act, a bill to increase high school graduation rates and improve access to college through the expansion of dual enrollment programs and early college high schools. Such programs allow young people to earn up to 2 years of college credit, including an associate's degree, while also earning their high school diploma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we work to reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act, we must find solutions to the growing dropout crisis facing our Nation's high schools and provide opportunities for young people to pursue higher education. Recent reports have illustrated the enormous challenge: the national graduation rate is only 70 percent and is significantly lower in many large urban school districts. For example, my home State of Wisconsin has a relatively high graduation rate of 86 percent, but that rate drops to  only 46 percent in the urban schools in Milwaukee. Such an achievement gap cannot continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For America to remain a leader in today's increasingly global economy, we must ensure that all young people obtain not only a high school diploma, but a postsecondary education as well. High dropout rates and low college attendance rates hurt individuals, families, and society. Young people who drop out of high school are at increased risk for unemployment and incarceration, and they are more likely to depend on public assistance for healthcare, housing and other basic needs. Conversely, adults  with a bachelor's degree will earn two thirds more than a high school graduate over the course of their working lives and are much less likely to experience unemployment or rely on social programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to support this bill, which provides competitive grant funding for dual enrollment programs that allow low-income students to earn college credit and a high school diploma at the same time. The Gates Foundation has been funding and evaluating such programs for several years now, and they have found that these programs work. Students can be motivated by a challenging curriculum and the tangible rewards of achievement, including free college credit and exposure  to career opportunities. These programs have shown incredible promise as a tool for increasing attendance, graduation, and college enrollment rates, particularly among low-income high school students. Dual enrollment puts students on the fast track to college and increases the odds that they will not only graduate, but go on to continue their education and secure higher-paying jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, this bill authorizes $100,000,000 for competitive 6-year grants to schools, with priority given to schools that serve low-income students. The funding will help defray the costs of tuition, textbooks, transportation, and other associated costs for students in early college high school and other dual enrollment programs. The bill also includes an evaluation component so we can measure the program's effectiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this investment in our schools will help solve the dropout crisis and secure America's future by ensuring that all young people can compete in today's global economy. Further, I believe that all children, regardless of income or other factors, deserve equal opportunities to fulfill their potential, and it is both morally and fiscally responsible for this Congress to invest in high-quality educational programs that help them reach that potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="Introducing S. 3512. A bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to remove social security account numbers from Medicare identification cards and communications provided to Medicare beneficiaries in order to protect Medicare beneficiaries from identity theft; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3512">S. 3512</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with Senator Bingaman and Senator Kohl to remove Social Security numbers from Medicare identification cards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Government agencies and private businesses have begun to recognize the danger of displaying Social Security numbers. A person's Social Security number can unlock a treasure trove of personal and financial information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If your Social Security number falls into the wrong hands, you are at risk of becoming a victim of identify theft and fraud. In 2006, the Federal Trade Commission reported that more than 8 million Americans were victims of identity theft in the prior year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirty-one states have enacted laws that limit how public and private entities use and display Social Security numbers. Social Security numbers are being removed from driver's licenses, and most private health insurance cards no longer display your Social Security number.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Federal agencies are taking steps to reduce the threat of identify theft. Last year, the Office of Management and Budget called on federal agencies to establish plans to eliminate unnecessary collection and use of Social Security numbers and to explore alternatives to Social Security numbers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Veterans Affairs no longer displays Social Security numbers on new veteran identification cards. And the Office of Personnel Management has directed health insurers participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program to eliminate Social Security numbers from insurance cards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is lagging behind other agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The same Social Security number that the Social Security Administration believes is so sensitive that it should not be carried in your wallet is found on the Medicare cards that 44 million beneficiaries carry with them at all times to access health care services. CMS expressly instructs Medicare beneficiaries to carry their Medicare card in their wallet or purse as proof of insurance, making their Social Security numbers readily available to any thief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, I offered an amendment to the fiscal year 2006 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill to require CMS to report to Congress on what steps would be necessary for them to remove Social Security numbers from Medicare cards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CMS issued the report in 2006, but it has not yet begun to remove Social Security numbers from Medicare cards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, the Inspector General of the Social Security Administration took CMS to task for its inaction. The Inspector General's report confirmed that displaying Social Security numbers on Medicare cards places millions of people at risk for identity theft and concluded that "immediate action is needed to address this significant vulnerability."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that I am introducing today, the Social Security Number Protection Act of 2008, establishes a reasonable timetable for CMS to begin removing Social Security numbers from Medicare cards and a date certain by which CMS would be required to complete the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not later than three years after enactment, CMS would be prohibited from displaying Social Security numbers on newly issued Medicare cards. CMS would be prohibited from displaying the number on existing cards no later than five years after enactment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to Medicare cards, the bill would prohibit CMS from displaying Social Security numbers on all written and electronic communications to Medicare beneficiaries, beginning no later than three years of enactment, except in cases where their display is essential for the operation of the Medicare program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Removing Social Security numbers from Medicare cards and communications to Medicare beneficiaries is long overdue. Medicare beneficiaries should not be placed at greater risk of identity theft than people with private health insurance. If other federal agencies can remove Social Security numbers, so can CMS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that Consumers Union, the Medicare Rights Center, and the Center for Medicare Advocacy have endorsed this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an issue we should all be able to unite behind. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation and work with me to enact it next year. Medicare beneficiaries deserve to be protected from criminals who seek to steal their identities in order to defraud them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
