  <speaking speaker="400052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, later this week, in our Committee on Energy and Commerce's Subcommittee on Health, we will be having a hearing called "Covering the Uninsured Through the Eyes of a Child, Part Two." Now, having sat through part one of this hearing, a hearing dealing with the reauthorization of CHIP funding this year, I really think the title of the hearing should be "Covering the Uninsured Through the Guise of a Child" because if some deception is implied in that title, indeed, I  believe some deception is taking place within the SCHIP program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, most of my colleagues in this body, having heard from medical professionals and hospital groups this past month up here on the Hill, are aware of the need for reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program this year. It is a good program. It has provided needed health insurance to millions of needy children across our country. And both the House and the Senate are discussing funding options. And we are concerned about the rising cost of health care in general but in particular, specifically,  the rising cost for the SCHIP program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourteen States are going to expect budgetary shortfalls in their SCHIP program. For some of those States, they are their own worst enemy. They are the reason for their own problem. They are using children's funding to cover adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fiscal year 2005, the adult enrollment in the SCHIP program exceeded the number of children enrolled in the program in four States: in Arizona we had over 113,000 adults in the program and just over 88,000 children; in the State of Michigan, over 101,000 adults and under 90,000 children; in Minnesota 35,000 adults and just over 5,000 children; in Wisconsin 108,000 adults, just over 57,000 children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, why does this matter? Well, if you look at what it costs to cover a child versus what it costs to cover an adult, for every dollar you spend on the adult, you only need to spend about 60 cents on the child. They are generally healthier. A dollar spent on children's health insurance goes a lot farther because children tend to be a healthier population, and if you provide them a modicum of preventative care, they are going to be healthier still. And after all, if we can attenuate a disease  in its early stages in childhood, we will avoid the larger expenditures of allowing that disease to go on unchecked over years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can think of a number of diseases that would fall into this category. Childhood obesity immediately comes to mind, an area where we need to devote significant time, energy, and resources. But if we are spending the money elsewhere, we are not going to be able to spend it on the children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the real deception, in my mind, is that this is a method of expanding a single-payer government-run health care system through the SCHIP program. And, again, that subverts the entire concept of why this program was created in the first place almost 10 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask my colleagues to remember a dollar spent on a nonpregnant adult is a dollar that is not spent on a needy child. Indeed, States should prioritize spending on needy children and live within their annual allocations instead of looking to other States from which to take their moneys when their programs run a shortfall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To ensure that States are not using children-specific funding for nonpregnant adults, I have introduced <bill type="h" number="1013">H.R. 1013</bill>, the SCHIP Equity Act. There are four principles to the bill:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It prohibits future HHS approval of any State waiver submitted by a State for SCHIP coverage of nonpregnant adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill terminates portions of State waivers that HHS has approved that extend coverage to nonpregnant adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>States must eliminate coverage of nonpregnant adults by January 1, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And if the coverage of a nonpregnant adult was part of a multipurpose waiver, those components not dealing with the coverage of the nonpregnant adult will remain in effect for the duration of the waiver.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SCHIP has been a success story for so many States, for so many children. I am asking you to consider supporting my bill, <bill type="h" number="1013">H.R. 1013</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to remind all Members of Congress that "C" in CHIP stands for "children." Let's keep it that way.</paragraph>
