    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have a managers' package of amendments which have been cleared and which are at the desk. Some are in modified form. Let me go through the list and then ask consent for their approval:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amendment No. 915, as modified, by Senator Grassley; amendment No. 916, as modified, by Senator Grassley; amendment No. 924, as modified, by Senator Obama; amendment No. 926, as modified, by Senator Menendez; amendment No. 944, as modified, by Senator Coleman; amendment No. 950 by Senator Baucus; amendment No. 951  by Senator Baucus; amendment No. 952, as modified, by Senator Baucus;  amendment No. 957, as modified, by Senator Hatch; amendment No. 958 by Senator Dorgan; amendment No. 965, as modified, by Senator Murray; amendment No. 970, as modified, by Senator Feingold; amendment No. 975 by Senator Landrieu; amendment No. 977 by Senator Murray; and amendment No. 980 by Senators ALEXANDER and BINGAMAN.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that these amendments, as modified, if modified, be agreed to and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me use the minute in opposition to the amendment. The Senator from Oklahoma may wish to speak in favor of his amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the amendment to strike the funding and the provisions in the bill for the Advanced Technology Program. In my view, this would be a very bad step for us to take. I know there are some Members who do not believe this is a worthwhile use of taxpayers' dollars. I am not one of those. I believe the Federal Government should partner with industry to assist in the early stages of technology development, and particularly that is important when we compete with other countries that spend heavily  to assist their industrial sectors to compete in world markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, there is no question the ATP program has had some successes. The fact is that over $2.5 billion has gone to Fortune 500 companies over the last 14 years for research they would have done otherwise. This is a program which is outmoded. We have a way to help businesses do research and development. It is called the R&amp;D tax credit. This is not effective. It is a poor way to spend our money.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague Senator CRAPO in offering our Sense of the Senate to express that the Congress and the administration take the necessary steps to sustain the United States' position as the global leader in financial services to <bill type="s" number="761">S. 761</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can all agree that the U.S. is the financial capital of the world. Today, Wall Street is booming, and our Nation's short-term economic outlook is strong. But to maintain our success far into the future we must immediately address a real and growing concern: our global competitive position in the capital markets is being threatened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The evidence is quite clear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>London, certainly our greatest competitor, has been working hard to gain on us in financial services in the last few years. And, although London has not overtaken us, it is no longer a distant second.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While New York is still the dominant global exchange center, we have been losing ground as the leader in capital formation. In 2005, only one out of the top 24 IPOs was registered in the U.S. and four were registered in London.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, the problem is not just IPOs. Our competitive position is being challenged in most businesses that are globally contestable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today London leads in some of the fastest growing and innovative areas in the financial services. They account for 70 percent of the global secondary bond market, 40 percent of the derivatives market, 30 percent of foreign exchange activity, and 30 percent of cross border equities trading.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is this happening? Not because London is more innovative--New York City is and 49 percent of the top CEOs say so. But, what they also say is--given the risks associated with developing innovative financial instruments and the importance of attracting talent in finance--the U.S.'s legal, regulatory and immigration policies are not attractive and it only makes sense to pursue cutting edge activity overseas. To make matters even worse, it is not only London. As technology has virtually eliminated  barriers to the flow of capital, it now freely flows to the most efficient markets, in all corners of the globe. So, in addition to London we're increasingly competing for position against cities like Hong Kong, Tokyo and Bombay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My concern about this issue has been keeping me awake at night. For over a year now I have been racking my brain, trying to understand the causes and fixes needed to keep us No. 1.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well ..... that is precisely what Mayor Bloomberg and I set out to do in  a more formal way when we commissioned McKinsey Consulting to conduct a study to examine the competitive position of New York City's financial services industry, specifically in comparison to London's. The study identified the drivers that might cause New York City to lose its competitive edge, but more importantly provided recommendations and an action plan to correct the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We gathered detailed analyses of market conditions here and abroad. McKinsey interviewed and consulted more than 50 respected leaders from the financial services industry, consumer and labor groups, and other stakeholders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our report which was released in January illustrated the reality of the situation. The U.S., New York in particular, is in grave danger of losing its status as the financial capital of the world without a major change in policy and regulation. If we continue on with the status quo, within the next ten years we will go from being number one, to becoming a marginalized regional market--spelling disaster for New York and the entire country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Financial services comprise 8 percent of the U.S. economy--the third fastest growing sector of the U.S. economy. The industry also plays an important intermediary role in promoting economic activity and creating jobs (savings, investment, borrowing, capital formation, wealth accumulation, transactions). 1 in every 19 jobs in the U.S. is in financial services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This clearly is not just a New York issue. Many of you will be surprised to learn, just as I was--that seven states (Connecticut, Massachusetts, Delaware, Rhode Island, North Carolina, South Dakota), including New York, have more than 10 percent of their State's GDP devoted to financial services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Resolving this issue will require all hands on deck. In New York we already recognize that--the Mayor, the Governor, and I have already joined forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly believe that we are in a good position to act now in order to lessen the damage that could be waiting for us 10 years down the road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cleary, this is an issue that will take some time to work through--taking on our country's regulatory regime, legal system and immigration policies will be no easy undertaking. In recognizing the complexities, our report focused on near term recommendations that are mostly administrative and the longer term recommendations that are legislative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend Secretary Paulson and the Department of Treasury for convening a conference on United States capital markets' competitiveness. I hope this will build more momentum for other financial services regulators and Congress to take action and sends a signal that we are in need of a renewed U.S. focus on competitiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We deed to take action to level the playing field for both domestic and foreign companies doing business in the United States, to address more complex policy, legal, regulatory and other structural issues affecting the U.S. position as the world's leading financial center. We must create a responsive, market-oriented regulatory framework, moving closer towards a fair and predictable legal environment, and provide access to skilled professionals from outside of the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my friend and colleague Senator CRAPO for his commitment and leadership on this issue. I look forward to working with you over the next several months to protect our capital markets--this is not a Democrat or Republican issue, it's an American issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is that we, in New York and in the U.S., literally cannot afford to lose our place as the global leader in financial services and we must examine which factors impede our competitive standing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, we have to be smart, careful, and balanced as we seek to continue to redefine the exquisite balance of innovation and regulation as markets evolve internationally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that addressing these challenges and ensuring that we do so in a way that continues to offer strong protections to consumers and investors will be a huge undertaking. But if all stakeholders--industry, consumer advocates, labor, and government--come together in the name of securing our economic future, we can do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Failing to do so would be dereliction of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must all commit to seeking a shift in national policy in a direction that will ensure that New York and America retain its leadership position in the financial services industry well into the 21st Century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues for joining us in support of this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300030" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in support of this global competitiveness amendment with the senior Senator from New York to <bill type="s" number="761">S. 761</bill> and to call attention to the challenges facing U.S. financial markets. I really appreciate the leadership role the senior Senator from New York has taken in the global capital markets competitiveness debate and I really appreciate our working relationship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first part of the amendment highlights findings that U.S. capital markets are losing their competitive edge in the face of intensifying global competition in initial public offerings, IPOs, over-the-counter, OTC, derivatives, securitization, and traditional lending. The second half of the amendment expresses the sense of the Senate about what steps should be taken to bolster the competitiveness of this essential sector of the U.S. economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Schumer/Bloomberg report entitled Sustaining New York's and the U.S.' Global Financial Services Leadership, "In looking at several of the critical contested investment banking and sales and trading markets--initial public offering, over-the-counter derivatives, and debt--it is clear that the declining position of the U.S. goes beyond this natural market evolution to more controllable, intrinsic issues of U.S. competitiveness. As market effectiveness, liquidity and safety become  more prevalent in the world's financial markets, the competitive arena for financial services is shifting toward a new set of factors--like availability of skilled people and a balanced and effective legal and regulatory environment--where the U.S. is moving in the wrong direction."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very alarming trend because IPOs and OTC derivatives contribute to a robust and dynamic capital market which is a tremendously beneficial force for our economy and an empowerment to our citizens. It is critical to ensuring economic growth, job creation, low costs of capital, innovation, entrepreneurship, and a strong tax base in key areas of the country. The U.S. financial sector acts as a catalyst for all other sectors in the U.S. economy. That is why the decline in global initial  public offerings in the United States, and the fact that London already enjoys clear leadership in the fast growing OTC derivatives market, are such worrying trends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report further states, "The IPO market also offers the most dramatic illustration of the change in capital raising needs around the world, and the U.S. exchanges are rapidly losing ground to foreign rivals. When looking at all IPOs that took place globally in 2006, the share of IPO volume attracted by U.S. exchanges is barely one-third of that captured in 2001. By contrast, the global share of IPO volume captured by European exchanges has expanded by more than 30 percent over the same period,  while non-Japan Asian markets have doubled their equivalent market share since 2001. When one considers mega IPOs--those over $1 billion--U.S. exchanges attracted 57 percent of such transactions in 2001, compared with just 16 percent during the first ten months of 2006."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It further notes: "London already enjoys clear leadership in the fast-growing and innovative over-the-counter derivatives market. This is significant because of the trading flow that surrounds derivatives markets and because of the innovation these markets drive, both of which are key competitive factors for financial centers. Dealers and investors increasing use derivatives and cash markets as interchangeable and are therefore combining trading operations for both products. Indeed, the derivatives  market can be more liquid than the underlying cash markets. Therefore, as London takes the global lead in derivatives, America's competitiveness in both cash and derivatives flow trading is at risk, as its position as a center for financial innovation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the common themes we are seeing in terms of movement of business away from the United States to  London and other capital markets are the regulatory burdens and the regulatory regime that we impose here in the United States. I do not think anybody would say that we should simply take down our regulatory position, because we do have one of the strongest markets in the world. But the question is are we over-regulating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, academics, business leaders, and politicians are working together to study this issue. They have identified several specific problems that hinder the competitiveness of the U.S. capital markets and have issued reports outlining possible solutions:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Interim Report of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, November 2006; Schumer/Bloomberg report entitled: "Sustaining New York's and U.S.' Global Financial Services Leadership, January 2007; Commission on the Regulations of U.S. Capital Markets in the 21st Century, March 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would especially like to commend the senior Senator from New York for his efforts in this project. All three reports add considerably to the understanding of the challenges that American capital markets face and offer solutions that could help American markets, companies, and workers to better compete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, on March 13, 2007, the Department of the Treasury convened a conference on United States capital markets competitiveness where conference delegates discussed ways to keep U.S. capital markets the strongest and most innovative in the world. This problem is well-documented and it is time that we take the necessary steps to restore America's leadership position in the global financial services marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment states it is the sense of the Senate</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(1) Congress, the President, regulators, industry leaders, and other stakeholders should take the necessary steps to reclaim the preeminent position of the United States in the global financial services marketplace;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) the Federal and State financial regulatory agencies should, to the maximum extent possible, coordinate activities on significant policy matters, so as not to impose regulations that may have adverse unintended consequences on innovativeness with respect to financial products, instruments, and services, or that impose regulatory costs that are disproportionate to their benefits, and, at the same time, ensure that the regulatory framework overseeing the United States capital markets continues  to promote and protect the interests of investors in those markets;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(3) given the complexity of the financial services marketplace today, Congress should exercise vigorous oversight over Federal regulatory and statutory requirements affecting the financial services industry and consumers, with the goal of eliminating excessive regulation and problematic implementation of existing laws and regulations, while ensuring that necessary investor protections are not compromised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is supported by the American Bankers Association, the Business Roundtable, United States Chamber of Commerce, Financial Services Forum, Investment Company Institute, International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, NASDAQ, and NYSE.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank my colleagues for joining me in supporting this amendment, and I thank the senior Senator from New York for working with me on this amendment</paragraph>

  <chair> Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate on amendment No. 922, offered by the Senator from Oklahoma.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak against this amendment. This amendment will increase the work of the inspector general because of its mandatory nature, but it will not add any additional results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, it provides that audits be posted on the Web within 60 days without any safeguards for proprietary information that may be gathered as a result of the audit, and it provides no protections under existing information privacy laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then there is the word "conference," which I think is too broad and has implications for existing and future educational activities, which is the major part of the underlying bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I voted against Senator Coburn's amendment, No. 922, because it will place a difficult burden on grant activities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA. The amendment as drafted has disturbing privacy implications. The inspector general's audits must be posted on the Web within 60 days without any safeguards for proprietary information. Further, the amendment is drafted so broadly that some reasonable uses of grant awards would be jeopardized.  Researchers might be restrained from attending peer conferences which are a part of the scientific process. NOAA awards grants throughout Michigan in order to protect and restore the Great Lakes, and I want to ensure that this amendment does not interfere with NOAA's mission</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300100" topic="NANOTECHNOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I would like to thank the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, and the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, for their leadership in crafting the America COMPETES Act and managing it on the Senate floor. I would also like to thank Senator Inouye and Senator Kennedy for their roles in developing and moving this bill. It is a critical piece of legislation that will help ensure our great Nation remains  competitive in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank my distinguished colleague from Oregon, Mr. Smith, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, and the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, Mr.  Pryor, for working with me to draft language to enable high schools and colleges to purchase nanotechnology equipment through grants from the National Science Foundation. And I thank the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez,  for working with us to add some of that language to his important amendment to this fine bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nanotechnology involves the understanding and control of matter at dimensions of roughly 1 to 100 nanometers--as small as a single molecule. At that scale, unique phenomena enable novel applications. The rapidly growing field of nanotechnology is generating scientific and technological breakthroughs that will benefit society by improving the way many things are designed and made. It will continue to be at the heart of innovation in a wide range of sectors for decades to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the inclusion of the language that we proposed, partnerships between low income school districts, colleges and universities, and businesses will be able to secure funds to purchase classroom versions of scanning electron microscopes and other tools that are fundamental to the study of nanotechnology.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="NANOTECHNOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague and the Senators from New Mexico, Tennessee, Massachusetts, Arkansas, and New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nanotechnology will have a significant, positive impact on the security, economic well-being, and health of Americans as fields related to nanotechnology expand. In order to maximize the benefits of nanotechnology to our citizens, the United States must maintain world leadership in the field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the National Science Foundation, foreign students on temporary visas earned 32 percent of all science and engineering doctorates awarded in the United States in 2003, the last year for which data is available. Foreign students earned 55 percent of the engineering doctorates. Many of these students expressed an intent to return to their country of origin after completing their study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To maintain world leadership in nanotechnology, the United States must make a long-term investment in educating U.S. students in high schools and colleges, so that our students are able to conduct nanoscience research and develop and commercialize nanotechnology applications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Preparing students for careers in nanotechnology requires they have access to the necessary scientific tools, including scanning electron microscopes designed for teaching, and involves training to enable teachers and professors to use the tools in classrooms and laboratories.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300100" topic="NANOTECHNOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS">
    <paragraph>I agree with my colleague. It is well documented that America needs to address the science, technology, engineering and math deficit--this entire bill is a reflection of that understanding. This deficit is possibly greatest in the Nation's poorest school districts. Yet these school districts also offer a reservoir of potential--potential, if properly tapped, that could generate hundreds of thousands of scientists and engineers who can help ensure that America can compete in the global  marketplace, and harness the economic promise--and good paying jobs--of emerging fields like nanotechnology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have seen some of the nanotechnology equipment that folks will be able to use these funds to purchase. And honestly, it is exciting stuff. I expect that it will help generate the enthusiasm, as well as the knowledge and understanding, necessary to attract and retain America's future nanotechnologists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would urge the Director of the National Science Foundation, as he is implementing this program, to give special attention to grant proposals that include a nanotechnology element.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="NANOTECHNOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS">
    <paragraph>I agree with my colleague from Oregon and I also hope that the Director will give special attention to grant proposals that include a nanotechnology element. Nanotechnology is not a specific technology, but a descriptive term encompassing a range of fields from biology to computer science, and from medicine to engineering. This legislation will enable high schools and colleges, in partnership with local businesses, to purchase basic tabletop nanotechnology tools for classroom  use--not laboratory use for research, but classroom use for education--to help create the next generation of scientists of all kinds, and to ensure that they will have the skills to apply nanotechnology to whatever specific scientific field they enter.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300100" topic="NANOTECHNOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS">
    <paragraph>I would like to make one last point--the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act will come up for reauthorization next year. As one of the authors of the act, and as one of the cochairmen of the Congressional Nanotechnology Caucus, I am looking forward to hearing my colleagues' thoughts about how the act might be amended to further promote American competitiveness in the vitally important field of nanotechnology.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="AUTHORIZATION FOR DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY BASIC RESEARCH, SECTION 2006">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to commend the managers of the bill for continuing here on the floor the remarkable cooperative effort that characterized the development of this legislation by the three Senate committees. That said, I want to note that I think we need to give further consideration to the funding pattern for basic research within the Department of Energy in Section 2006. We have responded to the Augustine Report's call for increasing our commitment to basic research in the  physical sciences by doubling funding over the next decade, but we need to make sure that those funds are distributed over the years in a manner that will maximize the effectiveness of those programs. I suggest that we need to increase and accelerate funding for these basic research programs. I request that the managers agree to work with me to accomplish that as this bill works its way through conference.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="AUTHORIZATION FOR DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY BASIC RESEARCH, SECTION 2006">
    <paragraph>I share my colleague's concern. We must ensure that the funding increases for the Office of Science at the Department of Energy are sufficient and that they are allocated to specific years so that there is a nexus between the needs of each of the various research programs and the amounts provided for each fiscal year. I will be pleased to work with my colleagues in conference to refine further these authorizations.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="AUTHORIZATION FOR DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY BASIC RESEARCH, SECTION 2006">
    <paragraph>I thank the senior Senator from New Mexico for bringing this matter to our attention. I, too, recognize the significant contributions of the Department of Energy Office of Science to our Nation's commitment to basic research. It is the largest Federal funding source of basic research in the physical sciences. So it is, of course, extremely important that we get the funding right. I will also be pleased to work with my colleagues to make certain we provide optimal support for these  programs.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="AUTHORIZATION FOR DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY BASIC RESEARCH, SECTION 2006">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues for their willingness to work with me on this issue, and I am hopeful that the conference report we ultimately consider will have the best funding scenario we can provide for these basic research programs.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="AUTHORIZATION OF THE ATP PROGRAM">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I had intended to call up amendment No. 969 which sets forth authorization levels for the Advanced Technology Program, ATP, to restore the ATP program to its historic funding levels. The Senate's defeat of the Coburn amendment expresses the will of the Senate to support the ATP program. I am also confident that the chairman and the committee can accomplish in conference what this amendment intended to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, by defeating the Coburn amendment to repeal the authorization for the Advanced Technology Program, ATP, the Senate has again expressed its support for ATP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This body understands the importance of this program. In the past the Senate has, on numerous occasions, supported amendments to the budget resolution to provide for ATP. Every time we have had an appropriations vote on this program we have retained funding for ATP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have lost 3 million manufacturing jobs since January 2001. In the face of these losses and strong global economic competition, we should be doing all we can to promote programs that help create jobs and strengthen the technological innovation of American companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ATP is one of the key Federal programs available to help U.S. manufacturers remain competitive in a global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have spoken with the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee and I am confident he will support strong funding for the ATP program in conference.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="AUTHORIZATION OF THE ATP PROGRAM">
    <paragraph>I will support efforts to authorize this important program which the Senate has so often voted to support, consistent of course with our ability to get a conference report that the Senate can pass.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="AUTHORIZATION OF THE ATP PROGRAM">
    <paragraph>Madam President, if all of the Members are here now, I want to express thanks--I think I speak for the whole Senate--for the work done by Senators Bingaman and Alexander. It is a very important piece of legislation. This is the fifth day we have worked on this piece of legislation; this is only the floor days. We spent hours and hours coming up with the idea, having meetings, meeting with individual Senators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a good piece of legislative work. As we know, legislation is the art of compromise. They have made the compromises which improved the legislation. They were assisted by the chair and ranking member of the HELP Committee, Kennedy and ENZI; Commerce Committee, INOUYE and STEVENS; and, of course, Senator Bingaman's housemate from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, has been on the floor a lot these past few days. It is good to see him up around, back  in his fighting form. He has done very good work as usual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also express my appreciation to Senator McConnell for allowing us to move forward. This is a good bipartisan piece of legislation. I said when this legislation started we were going to do something on a bipartisan basis. Recognizing that although there was a little bit of downtime on a few occasions, I made the decision before we went to this bill there would be no procedural cloture votes filed. I thought it was good to let everybody know we can work through these bills if we have  to with a little cooperation from everyone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me finally say, the House is going to complete the work on the supplemental sometime late tonight. We will get that sometime late tomorrow. We are going to try to have the final passage of this about a quarter to 1 tomorrow. I am assuming it will be final passage: we will have the vote, anyway. Then that will be the last vote for this week.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, let me join my good friend the majority leader, and say this is a good example of the Senate, a broad bipartisan bill of consequence, with spectacular, widespread participation led by Senator Alexander, Senator Domenici, Senator Stevens, and others on this side; Senator Bingaman and others on that side. This is a proud moment for the Senate. I congratulate all of those who spent a couple of years crafting this measure  and putting it together so it can enjoy this large vote it is about to receive.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, let me say very briefly that I very much appreciate Senator Reid's leadership in setting time aside and making this a priority for the Senate, and Senator McConnell as well. And, of course, I acknowledge the great work Senator Alexander has done at every stage in this process. He has done a terrific job, and he has been the persistent impetus for getting this legislation to this point and deserves great credit for it. Senator Domenici  does as well. He took a very strong leadership role in the last Congress and again in this Congress in getting this done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, Senator Ensign and Senator Lieberman have been real leaders on the issue, and Senator Mikulski, Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, Senator Hutchison, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Enzi. All of them have played a major part.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is multicommittee legislation and multi-Senator legislation. It is bipartisan, as was said. It is a good step for the Senate to be taking. I appreciate everyone's cooperation and help.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, out of respect to our colleagues, I am going to defer my remarks until after the vote except to say--all of the thank-yous, except to say one thing: There are a number of issues before this body that are too big for one party to solve. This has been one of them. But after 2 years of work across party lines, we ended up with 63 cosponsors, 208 pages of legislation. We dealt with 40 amendments in the last 3 days without any cloture. I hope this sets an example for  dealing with some of the other large issues we have that are too big for one party to solve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues for working with us in this way. I will be more specific about those thanks to the leaders and the other Senators after the vote.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, fellow Senators, I have been involved in the last 2 years in two major legislative efforts; both of them have been bipartisan, extremely bipartisan. I don't know how far that will carry us, but it certainly is a good feeling. It is different to know that Senators on both sides of the aisle support the effort you are making when you work hard for something like we did for this one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The brain power of our youth is the salvation of our country. It is the source of innovation and the source of our economic power. It is failing because we are not educating our children properly. That is the heart of the recommendation given to us. It is the heart of what they gave us as their recommendations, the great American leaders who volunteered, and we were able to keep most of it regardless of how difficult the committee jurisdictions are. Three major committees getting together to  fix this is pretty good work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank everyone. There are more that I want to thank one on one. I will thank them later. But it has been a great effort. I thoroughly enjoyed it after these many years of being a Senator. The last couple of years have been absolutely terrific when you can get a couple of major bills done with both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I speak today in support of the America Competes Act, ACA, a bill designed to increase math and science opportunities for our Nation's youth, an issue of great importance in our increasingly global economy. I have heard from Wisconsinites at the K-12 education level as well as members of my State's higher education community who have voiced support for the ACA and the boost it provides to math and science programming. I am particularly pleased the Senate accepted  my amendment to improve education privacy protections in the P-16 database component of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For decades, America has dominated the science and technological fields both in the higher education community and the business sector. As the National Academy of Sciences', NAS, report "Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for Brighter Future" outlined, the United States is facing some important challenges that need to be addressed if our country wishes to remain the worldwide economic and scientific leader. The report made clear that the science and technology preeminence  that we have enjoyed for decades should not be taken for granted and deserves serious attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NAS report also highlights the need for supporting basic and applied research as a foundation for America's continued competitive edge. The America COMPETES Act follows through on these suggestions by boosting funding for competitive basic research through the NSF and other agencies. I have long been a strong supporter of competitive research funding, cultivating young researchers, graduate students and professionals, and creating an overall environment that encourages innovation, so I was  glad to see these provisions in the legislation. While this legislation provides a Federal emphasis, this effort is going to have to be a partnership with public and private universities and colleges to be successful. Knowing Wisconsin, I am sure our institutions and higher education and companies will step up to the plate and embrace this partnership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Keeping America competitive globally is particularly relevant as manufacturing and industrial plants have closed in the United States and been rebuilt in other nations where the cost of hiring technical experts like engineers and chemists are often one-fifth or even one-tenth that in the US. While we need to boost education and employment training for these workers, I am concerned that retraining and major investment in the science and technology arena will not be enough to make a long-term difference  without improved trade agreements. I continue to be troubled by the trade agreements into which our country has entered in recent years. Too often, they lack even the most basic labor and environmental standards needed to prevent a race to the bottom, and to ensure that our businesses and workers can compete on an equal footing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While trade policy is an important aspect of our country's competitiveness, maintaining and strengthening America's competitiveness is a multi-disciplinary effort. I am pleased that the ACA includes funding for various important education programs including teacher professional development and summer learning institutes for K-12 teachers, and expanded access to AP and IB courses for students in high-need schools. Providing training and support to America's teachers is an essential component of  strengthening our nation's educational system and ensuring the educational growth of American students. Teacher quality is one of the biggest factors that impacts student achievement and too many students in our nation's most disadvantaged schools are taught by less experienced</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased the Senate adopted my amendment to strengthen the education privacy provisions in the title IV section of the bill which funds alignment of education programs. Under this section, States could apply for grants to improve alignment of the K-12 education standards with the skills that are needed for both the workforce and college. States could also use the grants to create P-16 databases which would compile information on students from kindergarten through college for the purposes  of improving education policy in the States. While I fully support better alignment between the K-12 and higher education systems, I was concerned that the privacy provisions of the underlying bill were not strong enough to protect this important student data. As we have seen recently with the unauthorized uses of the federal National Student Loan Data System, these data systems are not completely secure and are potentially subject to abuse by those who have access to such data systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment adds some commonsense protections that States would have to comply with in order to receive Federal funding to create or improve education databases. States and third parties will only be able to use the data in the P-16 systems to fulfill purposes set out in State and Federal education law and third parties who access the data must sign a data use agreement prohibiting further disclosure or unauthorized uses. States will also have to account for all disclosures of data and make  the accounting available to individuals whose data has been disclosed. Additionally, States must maintain adequate electronic security measures to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of the data. Databases established with these Federal grant dollars would be subject to the protections of the Family Educational and Privacy Rights Act. Finally, the underlying bill requires States to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During consideration of the bill I supported several amendments that would impose greater fiscal responsibility, such as Senator DeMint's amendment opposing earmarks and Senator Coburn's amendment addressing the Advanced Technology Program. I did not support other amendments that, while well-intentioned, could have undermined the principles and purposes of the bill. I opposed Senator Coburn's amendment to sunset the provisions of the ACA and its amendments because of  my concerns that this would nullify positive policy changes made by the ACA. I also opposed his  amendment regarding the grant programs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That amendment would have unduly interfered with grant recipients' ability to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased we were able to work in a bipartisan manner to pass this important legislation. Improving math and science programs for disadvantaged youth and strengthening professional development opportunities for America's teachers are critically important to our Nation's future. The United States has long been known for its leadership in scientific discoveries and achievement, but our country must continue to improve and strengthen our education programs related to math, science, and technology  if the United States wants to remain the world's leader on these issues. I believe the America COMPETES Act moves our country in the right direction towards achieving these important goals.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, passing <bill type="s" number="761">S. 761</bill>, the America COMPETES Act, is an important first step towards maintaining our country's competitive advantage in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation was written with strong bipartisan cooperation and negotiation. Many competing interests and competing views were heard during an open amendment process with Senators free to offer their ideas for improving the legislation. And, in what I hope is a sign of things to come, we were not forced to file cloture to complete action on this bill. Over the past few days, the Senate worked just as it was designed to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We would not have achieved this great bipartisan success were it not for the hard work of Senators Bingaman and Alexander. While many Senators played important roles in passing this bill, Senators Bingaman and Alexander were responsible for raising the awareness of our diminishing ability to compete, and for bringing a much-needed sense of urgency to this issue. I also want to recognize the hard work of a number of my colleagues, Senators Inouye, Stevens,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that we follow through on the commitments and investments we made today in passing the America COMPETES Act. And I am hopeful that we can continue to work together in a bipartisan manner to move this country forward.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, let me speak again about the extraordinary effort that went into this legislation and talk particularly about the staff work that has brought us to this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think everyone involved in this legislation knows this represents many days and many nights of hard work by staff people in our personal offices as well as on committee staff. We have seen a great example of how the staffs of the various committees can come together and produce a good product.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will reiterate the leadership among Senators for this work. Senator Alexander, of course, deserves tremendous credit. Senator Domenici deserves tremendous credit. Senator Lieberman and Senator Ensign have both worked very hard on this legislation and deserve great credit as well. I know Senators Reid and McConnell acknowledged their good work. We also, of course, could not have done this without the leadership of Senator Kennedy  and Senator Enzi on the HELP Committee, and without the leadership of Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, Senator Mikulski, and Senator Hutchison. There are several others I am sure I should have on the list as well because this was a combined effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The three committees that put this legislation together were the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, under the leadership of Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi; of course, the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee under Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens; and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The portion of this legislation that came from the Energy and Natural Resources Committee was reported out when Senator Domenici  was the chairman in the last Congress. I was proud to work with him in doing that. I can recall the effort the three of us made--Senator Alexander, Senator Domenici, and myself--to persuade the President to make this a priority. He did make it a priority. Of course, he deserves credit for that as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also talk for a minute about individual staff members on both sides of the aisle who worked very hard to make this a success--from the Commerce Committee: Jean Toal-Eisen, Jason Mulvihill, Chan Lieu, Beth Bacon, Jeff Bingham, H.J. Derr, Floyd Deschamps, and Christine Kurth; from the HELP Committee: Missy Rohrbach, Lindsay Hunsicker, Michael Yudin; from my staff: Carmel Martin, David Cleary, Anne Clough, Beth Buehlman, Roberto Rodriguez, and Ilyse Schuman; from the Energy Committee: Bob  Simon, staff director Jonathan Epstein, who has been working with me tirelessly on this legislation, Sam Fowler, and, of course, our general counsel, Kathryn Clay, and Melanie Roberts; on Senator Alexander's staff: Matt Sonnesyn and Jack Wells are the two with whom I am most familiar who have worked so hard; from Senator Lieberman's staff:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is legislation which could not have come together without the good work of all of these people whose names I have mentioned. They can be proud of their success in this venture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, this is only one hurdle in the process. It seems, in the legislative process, no matter how many hurdles jumped, there is always another ahead. We now have to find a way to reconcile any differences we have with the House on this set of issues. We hope we can do that successfully in the near future and send the bill to the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I particularly congratulate Senator Alexander and Senator Domenici. I know Senator Alexander has some comments he wants to make.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, let me say to Senator Bingaman, I greatly appreciate working with him. I do not believe there will be a more important piece of legislation to come before Congress this year because it goes right to the heart of something every American understands, which is, How do we keep our jobs? This is the way we do it. We keep our brainpower advantage. We keep our jobs in competition with China and India. There are other factors as well, but what we know is--and  we have a broad consensus in the Senate--that most of our remarkable standard of living, a situation where we have 30 percent of all the money in the world produced in this country for about 5 percent of the people, comes from our brainpower advantage, kindergarten through the twelfth grade, a wonderful higher education system, and our research institutes. That is the importance of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second thing about the legislation is that, to a remarkable degree, we rely on the people we ought to rely on in giving the answer to the question, How do we keep our brainpower advantage? Senator Bingaman and I, with the encouragement and under the leadership of Senator Domenici, who last year was chairman of the Energy Committee, asked the National Academy of Sciences: Please tell us the 10 things we need to do in order to keep our brainpower advantage so we can keep our  jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So they asked Norm Augustine, the former head of Lockheed Martin, to chair a distinguished group of about 21, and they gave up their summer 2 years  ago. They included three Nobel laureates, the former head of MIT, and others of that caliber, and they gave us 20--in priority order--things to do. At about that same time, the Council on Competitiveness had finished its work. Senator Lieberman and Senator Ensign had introduced their bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That legislation, which was the Domenici-Bingaman legislation, after a lot of work with the Bush administration, became the Frist-Reid bill toward the end of last year. Then, when we changed parties in the Senate, the very same bill became the Reid-McConnell bill. So we had worked closely together in a bipartisan way where we were able to overcome differences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not want the 88-to-8 vote to fool anybody. This was not that easy to do. This has been 2 years of work, with lots of different committees, many different ideas. But it has been a successful effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said, briefly, just before the vote, it is a privilege always to be a Senator. It has especially been a privilege this week because the Senate is acting as the Senate should. We are dealing, first, with one of the biggest issues facing our country. Second, we are recognizing it is one of that handful of big issues that cannot be solved by one party alone. The Democrats could have charged up and down the hill all night long, and they could not have done it. The Republicans could have done  the same, and we could not have done it. We could only have done it in the way we did it, and we did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are other issues out there like that. I think of immigration, which the majority leader has said we will be moving to soon. There is the question of affordable health insurance for every American. There is the question of energy independence. I hope this is a model for how we can work together and avoid some of the petty bickering we sometimes fall into. I think the American people would appreciate that, and I hope they will appreciate this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to thank especially the Senators whom Senator Bingaman talked about. He and his staff have been a delight to work with. Senator Domenici, of course, has been terrific to me as a junior member of his committee last year, allowing me to work on this. But when Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye and Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, basically, lent their prestige and sense of urgency to this legislation and stepped back and allowed it to  proceed and participated rather than claim some jurisdictional advantage, that is what really helped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Ensign made a tremendous difference within the Republican caucus, and Senator Hutchison and Senator Bond, and Senator Mikulski on that side. Senator Chambliss and others from the very beginning have worked on this issue. That is why we had 70 Senators on the Domenici-Bingaman bill last year--35 Republicans, 35 Democrats. And that is why we had 63 cosponsors of the Reid-McConnell bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Senator Reid allowed this to come forward, and Senator McConnell worked with him in a way that permitted this environment. It is pretty remarkable. We have had nothing like this in the Senate this year. We had no cloture--not one bit of cloture. We had a very complicated bill. We dealt with 40 amendments, and we got it all done within a week--on one of the most important pieces of legislation. That is a significant achievement. We should not forget the role Senator  Frist played last year in helping to move things along. So I thank my colleagues for the privilege of being a part of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Bingaman read the names, I believe, of all of the Democratic staff and Republican staff. I do not think he left anyone out. I want to especially, therefore, say--I hope this is appropriate to do--to Jonathan Epstein and Senator Bingaman's staff how much we appreciate all of them. They really have been indispensable to this effort. I also thank Matt Sonnesyn, who has been our lead. He has been indispensable, as well, and David Cleary; and Kathryn Clay on Senator Domenici's  staff, who has been crucial to the effort. The staff have spent hundreds of hours, literally, in the last 2 years working carefully through the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might say this, in conclusion--I know Senator Domenici has something to say--I took the legislation home over the weekend and reread it, all 208 pages. It is remarkably coherent, well written, and well organized. Maybe this process would be a good model for other legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House of Representatives is already moving. Congressman Gordon and Congressman Boehlert joined Senator Bingaman and me in asking the National Academies for their recommendations 2 years ago. Those recommendations have been introduced in the House. It is my hope that after our legislation goes there, the House will act soon, and we will be able to send this legislation to the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Domenici took us to the White House last year to talk with the President about this issue. He secured the invitation, and it was not just a Republican Senator or another Republican Senator, it was a Republican senior Senator and a Democratic senior Senator meeting with the President. That is the way we worked on this issue. So we appreciate the President's attention and priority to this issue. It would not have happened without that, either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Madam President.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Mexico.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I will be very brief because so much has been said, I do not think I should repeat it. I think all of the people who deserve to be thanked have been thanked. I thank Senator Bingaman for being so gracious to all of those who worked on this legislation. I say to Senator Bingaman, you always do, and you made sure the Record reflects each of their names, including those of my staff. We all thank you for that act of courtesy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to say, we all knew when we started we were addressing a very big problem. I am sure each of us from time to time has wondered whether what we were doing was going to have as big an effect as we hoped on our children in their ability to improve their brainpower, as we help teachers who teach them be better teachers of the hard subjects of math and science and the like.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure many times we wondered whether this was the right avenue and approach. But once we got into it, it was apparent we had not been led astray, that the leaders who put it together for us--and there is not a large group of them, but they are very talented, and they are very American--sought nothing but to give us the best recommendations for our country. That was a wonderful group in the Academies. Of course, their chairman, the former CEO of Lockheed Martin, just did a marvelous job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very hopeful, now that we have done this, we will get the money appropriated. I pledge here tonight I will do everything I can--and I hope we will muster more help as we go through appropriations--to see that we give this legislative thrust a chance. If you want a shell, you will get a shell. If you do not want to pay for these programs, you will not help your kids, because there is nothing mysterious about this. There is a huge amount of work that has to be done by people and institutions  that have to be paid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill says how we are going to pay for it, but it is an authorizing bill. I told the Senate that, and I proved it, there is nothing we could do in terms of the Budget Act for those who wanted to stop it, because it does not spend money. It authorizes a series of new ideas as the program for the country. The program is immobile without the resources that are stated. As we look at it carefully, we might even see we did not put enough in certain areas. I am certainly going to go to conference  and work on the Appropriations Committee with the full idea that we must fully fund this bill for the next 3 or 4 years if we are going to get what we want for our young people and the teachers and parents who so anxiously wait for something good and positive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This day has been a long time coming. For over a year, we have been working to pass a bill that will give America the brain power needed to compete in the global marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a process that began in the Energy Committee, with a request to the National Academy of Sciences to put together a report that told us what needed to be done to help America compete. That report, "Rising Above the Gathering Storm," led by former Lockheed CEO Norm Augustine, serves as the basis for the legislation we just passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, the Energy Committee moved forward with legislation that utilizes the Department of Energy and its national labs to train our teachers and rekindle interest in math and science. We called that bill the PACE--Protecting America's Competitive Edge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of last session, and again this year, we were able to partner with our leaders, Senator Reid and Senator McConnell, and our colleagues on the Commerce and HELP Committees, to put together the comprehensive America COMPETES Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Less than 6 percent of high school seniors have plans to study engineering, but 50 percent of our current U.S. science and engineering workforce is approaching retirement age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By bringing our national labs into the classroom, we can begin to address this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the Augustine report emphasizes the need for a renewed focus on basic science and research, this bill authorizes doubling the funding for DOE's Office of Science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with the House in conference to pass a strong, bipartisan bill that will allow America to rise above the gathering storm and compete once again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Madam President, once again, I thank Senator Bingaman. It has been a pleasure to get another bipartisan bill through with you. If we keep doing this, they are going to be mentioning the Senator from New Mexico so much--mentioning you and then me--they are going to think the whole place is full of Senators from New Mexico. We do not have to worry about that. We will take what we can get and do the best we can with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to the Senator, thank you, Lamar, for coming to me and asking: Could I push this with you all? It was a pleasure--and under my chairmanship--to push it with you and for you. It came out very well.</paragraph>
