  <speaking speaker="412248" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to speak for a few minutes this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I would like to speak about health care and on some of the comments made about the stimulus package that is going to be debated apparently in upcoming days, I would first like to make mention of the tornado damage that has occurred in our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have officially 32 deaths. That number may rise. Certainly, we have had numbers of people in our State who have gone without housing. They have lost their worldly possessions. They have lost family members. In this time of grief for many people, I think we have also seen something that has been very uplifting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly, after other disasters that have taken place in this country in recent times, there, in some cases, has been a sense of concern about whether our Government is able to meet the needs of these disasters we have seen in various parts of the country and in some cases the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the State of Tennessee FEMA, under the leadership of Director Paulison, and TEMA, under the leadership of General Bassham, and then the leadership of various local agencies that deal with disasters have responded in incredible ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In our State, I think what we have seen is an unprecedented cooperation that has taken place, one that I think is going a long ways toward causing people to see our Government responding in a way that is very responsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have also seen numbers of people who have given of themselves to help their neighbors. We have had Red Cross personnel on site, we have had lots of volunteers from various organizations throughout our State helping those in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has caused me to feel great about our leadership, Federal, State and local, as it relates to responding to these people in times of need. I know this will continue as 16 counties right now are under the Federal disaster designation; there may be more coming. But my hat is off to all those who have been involved in helping people in this time of need.</paragraph>
