    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the band continues to play today while Congress argues the "Resolution of Retreat" from Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This illness of defeatism is spreading. Self-proclaimed military experts are saying the war cannot be won, even with more troops. Wars have always had homegrown critics and doomsayers, even in the military. Those in and out of the military who say we cannot win should never be placed in a position to allow us to lose. Those critics are thorns in the battlefield of hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution, this policy of "No More Troops for the Troops" leaves our volunteers in Iraq in a precarious, vulnerable situation. Since no help is coming to their aid, what shall our troops now in Iraq do with less manpower? Fight a containment war? Fight not to lose? Or win? Not fight? Retreat to the hills?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution is good news to the terrorists, bad news for the troops. We should find the moral will to finish our mission in Iraq and protect American interests with whatever number of troops is necessary. Duty requires such, and safety and honor demand it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
