  <speaking speaker="400051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to commend the men and women serving in the Federal Correction Complex in Coleman, Florida, in my district. This Federal complex serves our Nation by housing prisoners in low-, medium- and high-security facilities. It has provided countless jobs in my district and helped our growing economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people who fill those jobs truly are a testament to the array of wonderful people in my district. Even with the struggles in funding and thinly stretched staff, the officers at Coleman are cheerful, positive, and professional people. Staffing a prison complex is no easy job, and many of the officers there literally have scars to prove it. Yet they know their job is to keep our families safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had the opportunity to tour this facility several times and meet with the staff, and I am proud to serve alongside such honorable public servants. I want to take this opportunity to give them all my heartfelt thanks.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
