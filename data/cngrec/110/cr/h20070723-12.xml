    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Great Lakes are the source of our drinking water for 30 million Americans, and the Congress has enacted new laws to protect the Great Lakes ecosystem, including the Great Lakes Legacy Act and the Regional Collaboration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why we were surprised, no, stunned, when British Petroleum applied for the rights to increase its pollution of Lake Michigan. A 35-percent increase in ammonia dumping, a 54-percent increase in the dumping of suspended solids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>BP is one of the most profitable companies on Earth. Their plans include a $3 billion upgrade to the facility, but they presented excuses from their own paid consultant that they had to increase their pollution of the lake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, tomorrow the Congress will take up a resolution condemning BP and the actions of the State of Indiana that approved this pollution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>BP is a company spending millions to brand itself as a friend of the environment, but we know what BP stands for, "Bad Polluter."</paragraph>
