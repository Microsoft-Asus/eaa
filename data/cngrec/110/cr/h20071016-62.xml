  <narrative>2007 COMMEMORATIVE COINS: LITTLE ROCK CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL DESEGREGATION AND JAMESTOWN 400TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11620]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Snyder) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400383" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, public attention 50 years ago, in 1957, was on Little Rock, Arkansas. Everyone in the United States knew of the events that were going on at Little Rock Central High School and in the streets surrounding Little Rock Central High School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now this year we celebrate the courage of the Little Rock Nine. Now this year, 2007, we commemorate those events, the desegregation of September 25, 1957, very much aware of the work that we have to do in race relations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As part of the honoring of these events and the honoring of the courage of the brave Little Rock Nine, this Congress passed a commemorative coin bill. We authorize two commemorative coins each year. The commemorative coin I want to show the Members, it is a beautiful coin. Now, the real coin is not this big. It's a silver dollar. It is a commemorative coin. While it is legal tender, you would not want to use it for legal tender because it costs substantially more than a dollar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the one side. Each star honors one of the Little Rock Nine, the nine stars. And these footprints show young people going to school with no other desire than to get an education. And it says: "Desegregation in Education, 2007, In God We Trust."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the other side of the coin is the Little Rock Central High School itself, one of the most beautiful high schools in the United States, and it is noted there: "Little Rock Central High School."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the reason I show this coin to the Members on the floor tonight is this coin is currently available for sale at the U.S. Mint, usmint.gov. And for those of you who need some help, go to usmint.gov and then go to the section that says "Coins and Medals" and click on that and click on "Commemoratives," and you can find out how to order this beautiful coin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also available at usmint.gov is the other 2007 coin that was brought by the late Representative Jo Ann Davis, a much beloved Member of this body who recently passed away. That coin honors the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown in 1607.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have two wonderful commemorative coins: this one honoring the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School by the Little Rock Nine in 1957 and the 400th anniversary of Jamestown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, what many people may not realize is $10 of every sale of each coin goes to support these historic sites, and that is why I am down here tonight, Mr. Speaker, encouraging people to go to usmint.gov and order these coins to tell the legacy, to pass a legacy on, to tell the stories. They make wonderful holiday gifts this year, but they also just make wonderful gifts from people to younger people to remember the legacy and the courage of the Little Rock Nine, usmint.gov.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to acknowledge this evening in Little Rock, Arkansas, the presence of Kevin Klose, the present president of National Public Radio. Right now he is at a reception at the home of Don and Suzanne Hamilton in Little Rock, Arkansas. They are my neighbors across the street. They are great members of the Friends of KLRE/KUAR. Unfortunately, I can't be there. I believe my wife is ill and can't be there. But I wish them well and welcome Kevin Klose to Arkansas.</paragraph>
