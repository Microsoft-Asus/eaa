    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Resolution 1015 provides for consideration of House Resolution 2857, the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education, or GIVE, Act under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Education and Labor. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule makes in order the Education and Labor Committee-reported substitute as an original bill for the purpose of amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rule makes in order 11 amendments, which are listed in the Rules Committee report accompanying the resolution. Each amendment is debatable for 10 minutes. The rule also provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of a vital piece of legislation, legislation that directly affects all of our communities and the lives of millions of Americans; legislation that strengthens our communities, helps educate our future generations, teaches our youth to prepare for and respond to unthinkable tragedies, and fosters the growth of respect and compassion throughout our entire society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Corporation for National Community Service estimates that in 2006 the national service participants provided the Nation with nearly $4 billion worth of service projects. The GIVE Act reauthorizes our country's investment in community service and volunteerism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As co-chair of the National Service Caucus, it is a pleasure to call attention to the tremendous work of those involved at every level and in every program of the corporation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, service and volunteerism are the bedrock of our emergency preparedness and national security. In times of strife, the American people have always shown a spirit of service and ingenuity. Investing in service and volunteer programs prepares us to handle any crisis. We must focus on building our national capacity, and harnessing the enterprising spirit of the American people is a good way to do so. In the wake of a catastrophe, a first responder is likely to be a civilian. A neighbor  is likely to be the first one to provide assistance. By building up our service and volunteer programs, we are taking proactive steps to bolster our national security and capability to weather a disaster now and in the years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We saw firsthand the importance of having trained volunteers in the wake of the 2005 hurricanes. These forever changed thousands of lives and communities in the gulf coast. We watched as men and women mourned their loved ones and remembered the lives they once had. We also witnessed an outpouring of support and compassion from individuals who were touched by this immense tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following the devastation in the gulf coast, more than 92,000 national service volunteers contributed over 3.5 million hours of service to the recovery effort. They repaired neighborhoods. They rebuilt lives. Our national service participants have also applied their expertise towards training local community volunteers, further expanding the network of effective workers to 260,000 people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The assistance from volunteers following the devastating storms represents only one example of the many accomplishments that our service volunteers achieve every single day. Through programs such as AmeriCorps State and National, Volunteers in Service to America, and National Civilian Community Corps, AmeriCorps volunteers address critical needs in our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I am home in Sacramento, I am reminded by my constituents of the great work done by AmeriCorps NCCC volunteers. AmeriCorps NCCC members are disaster trained and available for immediate deployment in the event of a natural disaster anywhere within the United States, as they were to the gulf coast. In fact, NCCC teams have responded to every national disaster since the program was established.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over $26 million worth of hurricane recovery resources have come from AmeriCorps NCCC alone, which is more than we spent on the entire program nationwide. This is quite a return on our investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GIVE Act will strengthen the emergency preparedness and response training of our country's NCCC participants. The changes will also help the program continue to grow. Recently, the corporation added two new campuses, one in Iowa and one in Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GIVE Act recognizes the work of every volunteer in this country. It seeks to reach out to more people to greatly expand the number of volunteers across this country. Our bill will expand AmeriCorps membership from 75,000 to 100,000 by 2012. The bill seeks to tap the growing pool of baby boomers reaching retirement that wish to continue serving their country by lowering the age of participation in Senior Corps to 55 from 60 years old. Equally important is that the bill harnesses the energy  of future generations in addition to the baby boomers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Engaging our youth early on is vitally important to the safety of our communities and the lives of our children. The Summer of Service program  will ensure that students making the transition from middle to high school have an opportunity to participate in service programs. By increasing the education award, the bill allows young service participants to apply the skills that they learn in volunteerism to a successful education. The benefits of service  will continue to accrue to volunteers even after they complete their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a result of the great work of the AmeriCorps members, extraordinary things are happening all over America. The corporation supports such important nonprofit organizations as Habitat for Humanity, City Year, and Red Cross.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National service participants have built homes, healed wounds, and taught elementary school kids. These volunteers are part of the backbone of our country. With very little funding, service participants leverage millions of dollars and perform crucial work in classrooms, national parks, and areas of our Nation hit by disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, I hope my colleagues will support the rule and the underlying legislation. The spirit of service that is so important to all of our communities is one that should be encouraged and supported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would like to thank my friend, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui), for the time and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a world often plagued by selfishness, those who commit themselves to the service of others through volunteerism really serve as a beacon of compassion and hope for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Community service is one of the most gratifying, rewarding, fulfilling ways people can give back to their communities. Community service has always been a vital pillar of our society. Volunteers all over the Nation dedicate millions of hours to their contemporaries, all in the hope of making people's lives better. Through their selfless work and tireless effort, volunteers help improve the lives of millions of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1993, Congress, with my support, passed legislation creating AmeriCorps and the Corporation for National and Community Service to administer and coordinate Federal community service programs. Since then, almost 500,000 Americans have served with thousands of nonprofit organizations, public agencies, and faith-based organizations nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These citizens tutor and mentor children, they coordinate after-school programs, they build homes for the needy, they conduct neighborhood patrols, restore the environment, respond to disasters, build nonprofit capacity, recruit and manage volunteers. They do, oftentimes, exemplary work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The underlying legislation, Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill>, the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act, known as the GIVE Act, will reauthorize the national service programs administered by the Cooperation for National Community Service. This reauthorization will help increase the number of volunteers in AmeriCorps to over 100,000 by 2012. It will also create service opportunities for middle school and high school students through the Summer of Service program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation emphasizes the critical role of service in meeting the national priorities of emergency and disaster preparedness. I do believe it will help improve program integrity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that the committee, the Committee on Education and Labor, worked in a bipartisan manner to reauthorize this program and to include provisions that will make these programs more effective and efficient, responding to State and local needs, and performance-oriented. It goes to show, Madam Speaker, that when we are willing to work together and negotiate, we can bring forth good pieces of legislation with bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I know the majority is trumpeting this rule with which we bring this underlying legislation to the floor because it will allow Members to debate all the amendments to the Rules Committee. But I remind my colleagues, Madam Speaker, the majority does this only when the underlying legislation is noncontroversial, even though the majority promised to be the most open Congress in history. If the majority is so proud of this rule, it should allow open rules on controversial bills as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, Madam Speaker, I urge Americans everywhere, regardless of whether they take part in a AmeriCorps, to volunteer and give back to their communities. The rewards are extraordinary to both the volunteer and to the community. As Winston Churchill said, "We make a living by what we do, but we make a life by what we give."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400663" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would like to inquire of the gentleman from Florida if he has any remaining speakers.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="">
    <paragraph>We have no other speakers. I am ready to make my final remarks.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Florida is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the reauthorization of AmeriCorps certainly is an important matter and one that deserves our attention, I must express my disappointment that the majority decided to take up this legislation before we finish our work on bipartisan legislation to protect Americans from international terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 14, the majority decided to leave Washington to take a President's Day recess and allowed the Protect America Act to expire 2 days later, rendering U.S. intelligence officials unable to begin new terrorist surveillance without cumbersome bureaucratic hurdles. Because of the inaction of the majority, the United States is more vulnerable to terrorist attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This didn't have to happen, Madam Speaker. Earlier last month, the Senate passed, by a bipartisan vote, really an extraordinary vote of 68-29, a bill updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, a bill that the chairman, Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said, and I quote, "is the right way to go in terms of the security of the Nation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could have easily considered that legislation, but the majority in the House instead decided to head home. The House should vote on the Senate measure, and the House should vote on the Senate measure now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we must always try to stay one step ahead of those who wish to harm Americans. Now is not the time to in any way tie the hands of our intelligence community. The modernization of the foreign intelligence surveillance is a critical national security priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that several of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle also agree. On January 28, 21 members of the Blue Dog Coalition, Democrats, sent a letter to the distinguished Speaker in support of the Senate Rockefeller-Bond FISA legislation. The letter states, and I quote, "The Rockefeller-Bond FISA legislation contains satisfactory language addressing all these issues, and we fully support that measure, should it reach the House floor without substantial change. We believe these  components will ensure a strong national security apparatus that can thwart terrorism across the globe and save American lives here in our country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I will give all Members of the House an opportunity to vote on the bipartisan long-term modernization of FISA. I call on all my colleagues, including the members of the Blue Dog Coalition that signed the letter to the distinguished Speaker, to join with me in defeating the previous question so that we can immediately move to concur in the Senate amendment and send the bill to the President to be signed into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remind my colleagues that defeating the previous question will not prohibit consideration of the underlying legislation being brought to the floor today, the GIVE Act, but would merely require that we first take a vote on FISA modernization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="">
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "no" on the previous question and in favor of a bipartisan long-term solution that helps protect American lives from international terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400663" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, first, I would like to say that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act continues to give the intelligence community the tools it needs to monitor terrorists. The government always has the option of tapping targets immediately and returning to the FISA Court within 72 hours to obtain an order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My constituents and those of other Members of Congress view the protection of civil liberties as one of their top priorities. The American people want us to do our representational duty to uphold the Constitution and deliberate on this issue. We are working hard to ensure that our national security needs are met as our constitutional rights are protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we are working to support national service in our country, which helps our communities respond to disasters and also encourages our youth to engage in civic participation. Last year, I had the pleasure of meeting with Tatiana, a strong and determined young woman from Sacramento, my hometown, who received an award for CorpsMember of the Year. When Tatiana was just 15, her mother was incarcerated, and later, she was expelled from high school. Meeting with her and hearing her story of how she  used the local Conservation Corps to turn her life around was truly inspiring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This reauthorization takes programs and infrastructure that have touched so many lives, such as Tatiana, and builds off its foundation to greatly increase the quality and quantity and improve national service. National service is a proven return on our investment. With this bill, we will broaden those involved in service, and in doing so, foster the values of civic engagement and duty that can change a life and also draw upon the lessons of guidance and wisdom of our seniors that only a lifetime  of experience can provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan legislation makes excellent improvements to an already successful Federal agency. It improves access and support for organizations and grant applicants, and most importantly, reassures our valued volunteers that Congress supports them and their work. I urge a "yes" vote on the previous question and on the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The material previously referred to by Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida is as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amendment to <bill type="hr" number="1015">H. Res. 1015</bill> Offered by Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of the resolution, add the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sec. 3. "That upon adoption of this resolution, before consideration of any order of business other than one motion that the House adjourn, the bill (<bill type="h" number="3773">H.R. 3773</bill>) to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to establish a procedure for authorizing certain acquisitions of foreign intelligence, and for other purposes, with Senate amendment thereto, shall be considered to have been taken from the Speaker's table. A motion that the House concur in the Senate amendment shall  be considered as pending in the House without intervention of any point of order. The Senate amendment and the motion shall be considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled by the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader or their designees. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to final adoption without intervening motion."</paragraph>

  <narrative>(The information contained herein was provided by Democratic Minority on multiple occasions throughout the 109th Congress.)</narrative>
  <narrative>The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means</narrative>
  <narrative>This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Democratic majority agenda and a vote to allow the opposition, at least for the moment, to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of Representatives, (VI, 308-311) describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as "a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge." To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that "the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the  previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition" in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry,</narrative>
  <narrative>Because the vote today may look bad for the Democratic majority they will say "the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution .... [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever." But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the definition of the previous question used in the Floor Procedures Manual published by the Rules Committee in the 109th Congress, (page 56). Here's how the Rules  Committee described the rule using information from Congressional Quarterly's "American Congressional Dictionary": "If the previous question is defeated, control of debate shifts to the leading opposition member (usually the minority Floor Manager) who then manages an hour of debate and may offer a germane amendment to the pending business."</narrative>
  <narrative>Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled "Amending Special Rules" states: "a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate." (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: "Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition  to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon."</narrative>
  <narrative> Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Democratic majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan.</narrative>
