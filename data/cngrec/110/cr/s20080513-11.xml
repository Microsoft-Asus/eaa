  <chair>Cloture Motion</chair>
  <chair>We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 275, <bill type="h" number="980">H.R. 980</bill>, the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act.</chair>
  <chair> By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call is waived.</chair>
  <chair>The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="980">H.R. 980</bill>, the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act, shall be brought to a close?</chair>
  <chair>There is 2 minutes of debate, equally divided.</chair>
  <chair>The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is the legislation to provide a voice for our public safety offices. We have spent a great deal of time in the Senate on homeland security, but the key to effective homeland security is having effective firefighters, police officials, and first responders. They are the individuals who are really protecting our homeland. They are the ones who should have a voice in decisions affecting the security of our country. This legislation provides them with that, to ensure  greater safety and security for all Americans. I hope the Senate will support the cloture motion.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, once again, we have one of those bills that has never been to committee. I guess we are afraid to take labor issues to the Labor Committee. We ought to be able to review these things and work on them as we do on other kinds of bills, but that is not happening on the labor issues. We are just going to play "gotcha" politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will take longer than a minute or an hour or a day just to cover some of the flaws that are in this bill. Some of the things that have shown up in the substitute bill never got introduced on this one. So we can see how this doesn't work. This will affect all 50 States. This is an opportunity for you to impose the will of the Federal Government on your State. I don't think you really want to do that. We need to have a little bit more than a minute to discuss that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the leadership is asking for people to vote for this amendment. We have agreed that we would go to it right after lunch. This isn't a matter of stalling out in the Senate; it is a matter of trying to get the right decision made. I ask you to look at these things. It ought to go to the Labor Committee so that reasonable suggestions can be made.</paragraph>
