    <paragraph>Mr. President, before we get to the nomination, I want to say a couple things. Today is the graduation of the pages. There will be a ceremony at 10 o'clock honoring them in remembrance of their stay in the Capitol. The pages do invaluable work, and they have for many years. I depend upon them personally all the time. They do a lot of things that are unnoticed. In fact, almost everything they do goes almost unnoticed, but they are vitally important. They do many things, and over the  decades we have come to rely upon them. I will speak later this morning at the graduation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want them to know, as well as the people watching today, how the pages are an integral part of this great institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list reflecting the names of the Senate pages be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
