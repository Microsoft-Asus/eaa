    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the House Education and Labor Committee, I am proud that today many Americans will receive their first pay raise in a decade because the Fair Minimum Wage Act passed by the Democratic Congress goes into effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These hardworking Americans, 40 percent of whom are minorities, will receive a 70-cents-per-hour raise today, which will be followed by two more 70-cent increases in July 2008 and July 2009. This will result in a total of $2.10 increase, or $4,400 a year. This boost in pay will make a significant difference in the lives of these American families who are trying to survive on a minimum wage that has reached its lowest effective level in more than half a century. It means more food on their tables,  better health care for their families, and a shot at sending their children to college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone who works full time should have the chance to achieve these pieces of the American Dream. And with this increase in minimum wage which begins today, they can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be a part of the Democratic Congress that passed this long overdue pay raise for millions of hardworking Americans. I want to note that my home State of New Jersey led the way in an increase in minimum wage. Our minimum wage is already $7.15 an hour, and that rate was effective since October 2006.</paragraph>
