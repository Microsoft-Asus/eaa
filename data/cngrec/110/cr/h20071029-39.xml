  <narrative>THE DRIVE ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12135]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last week the Capitol hosted a display of electric cars, hybrids like the Toyota Prius and various generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And there was one car that got my attention. It was an Auto-Cycle. It was a one-man car. It would go 75 miles an hour. And the owner of it did not drive it in from Ohio where it was made, but he said he could have. It goes 75 miles an hour. And if you have a car like that in town, you basically plug it in every day and you run all day long, and you don't use one ounce of gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a cosponsor of something called the DRIVE Act. It is a bipartisan bill cosponsored by me and Eliot Engel of New York. The idea behind it is to get off Middle East oil by increasing the incentive to buy hybrid cars, flex-fuel vehicles, electric vehicles, biodiesels, cars that run on ethanol, and a number of other alternative-fuel vehicles. We have the technology that's out there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are doubling, in the DRIVE Act, the tax credit for buying hybrids in such cars. I believe that this is a step in the right direction, and I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the DRIVE Act.</paragraph>
