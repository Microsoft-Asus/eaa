    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I would consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Chairman Miller and the committee staff for helping move this bill so quickly and the gentleman from Tennessee for being here with me today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We often recognize teachers for their hard work, for their dedication to our children. In fact, we need to do more of this. Teachers are very important to ensuring that our children are learning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, there has been far too little recognition for the school support personnel, those who help schools run smoothly, the classified school employees. Teachers can't teach without support of classified school employees. This includes instructional assistants, clerical staffs, school bus drivers, food services employees, maintenance, security and others who ensure a safe and healthy school day every day for our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Imagine a school day without this support: without bus drivers, how would our children get to school? Without janitors, who will ensure their classrooms, cafeteria and bathrooms are clean? Without food service personnel, who will serve their food, who will order their food? Without a school nurse, where will children go if they are not feeling well or they are needing medication? Without maintenance personnel, what would happen if something broke or if the school is too hot or too cold? Without  office and clerical staff, who will ensure that the proper person picks up a child? And without security personnel, who will make sure our schools are safe? These responsibilities need to be met in order for our students to be able to do what they come to school to do: learn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What do our teachers come to school for? To teach. These and many more tasks would not be possible without these important school employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>That is why I introduced this resolution with Chairman Miller and Representative Hare, to recognize the many contributions classified school employees make to our children's school day. Without the work of these valuable employees, schools would be unable to function.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we recognize the work of the classified school employee and thank them for their hard work in helping ensure that our schools run smoothly. I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the efforts of our classified school employees and thanking them for all they do to make certain our children are able to learn and teachers are able to teach in a safe and healthy environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 376, which will recognize annually a National Classified School Employee of the Year and the valuable contributions of classified school employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank my colleague from California (Ms. Woolsey) for her leadership on this issue and for introducing the resolution we are considering today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many schools across the country and in my district, the education of our Nation's children is a team effort. Often, when education is discussed, we think of teachers and administrators. However, classified school employees, school bus drivers, food service workers, clerical and administrative staff, para-educators, and facilities and maintenance workers protect and nurture children as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Classified school employees are usually the first of the school staff workers the children see when they start their day and the last ones they see when they go home. They are the caretakers of our schools and community colleges. School bus drivers carry the most precious cargo, our children. Parents want the peace of mind that comes from entrusting the person behind the wheel in their children's school bus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Getting kids to and from schools safely and on schedule makes bus drivers, mechanics, and other transportation personnel an integral part of our schools and of our communities. Classified employees in the office, clerical and administrative staff, maintain attendance records, answer the phones, and interact with parents and school officials. School nurses help children with scrapes and cuts, assist with medications, and help keep accurate records of immunizations and students' medical history.  All of these school employees are vital to the success of our schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without skilled facilities and maintenance workers, our children would not have safe and comfortable places to learn. A lot of work is required to maintain a school community and keep it running smoothly. Custodians keep the schools clean. Groundskeepers keep the grounds safe for sports and other recreational activities. And facilities workers foresee and troubleshoot problems in school buildings. These classified workers provide a valuable service to our schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many times the meal students receive at school is the best or only meal they get each day. Food service workers play a significant role in the educational process by providing nutritious meals for children. Research shows that good nutrition enables a student to meet their educational and physical potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Para-educators, librarians and other instructional assistants, support and  enhance the work of teachers in all components of the educational process. The increased use of para-professional staff in education across the United States has been well documented, as has the change in their role from largely clerical to instructional duties. These professionals play a key role in ensuring student achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together, with certified school employees, teachers, and administrators, classified school employees work hard to provide productive, safe and stable environments for our children that are conducive to learning. Classified school employees strive for excellence in all areas relative to the educational community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For that, I ask that we annually recognize a National Classified School Employee of the Year and honor the invaluable contributions of all classified school employees for their tireless commitment to the academic success, safety and well-being of America's children, and I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 376.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our schoolchildren couldn't attend school and teachers couldn't teach without the efforts of these valuable school personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Personnel like Al Hart, District Information Services Coordinator for Reed School District in southern Marin County. Mr. Hart was recognized this year as the Marin County classified school employee of the year. His hard work and that of other school employees in the rest of the 6th district of California, and the rest of the country should be recognized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Classified school employees work with teachers and administrators to ensure that our schools are safe and healthy places. Their contributions are invaluable and can be recognized today and every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="hr" number="376">H. Res. 376</bill> to thank classified school employees for their work and to recognize them for their efforts.</paragraph>
