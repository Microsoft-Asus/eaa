    <paragraph>Mr. President, on March 30, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced that Mountain Home Air Force Base in my home State of Idaho had earned the coveted 2007 Commander in Chief's Annual Award for Installation Excellence. This Presidential honor is given only to a single installation in each of the military branches for outstanding and innovative efforts by installation personnel. I am honored to be able to publicly herald this tremendous achievement by Colonel Rock and all the men  and women of Mountain Home Air Force Base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This high honor reflects a sustained level of excellence by all the Gunfighters of Mountain Home. Installation of the Year can only be achieved if everyone, from the wing commander to airmen working in all aspects of operations and support, has their priorities straight and expectations for personal duty performance at the highest level. Improving the structures that protect valuable aircraft, creative and responsible financial management with regard to improving facilities, and a commitment  to Air Force families are just some of the ways in which Mountain Home Air Force Base demonstrated its excellence this year. The Gunfighters have maintained this strong tradition of superiority and excellence for over half a century. The missions have changed over the years, but Gunfighter commitment and performance has not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Idahoans can be very proud of their Gunfighters. Mountain Home Air Force Base is as much a part of Idaho history as the magnificent valleys, rivers, and plateaus that surround the base. The 366th Fighter Wing is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to the national security of the United States. The missions currently headquartered at Mountain Home comprise a vital component of our comprehensive military defensive and offensive force. Idaho is fortunate to be host and home to these defenders  of freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Idaho benefits from Mountain Home Air Force Base, not just when the military men and women serving out their assignments there call our State "home" for a time in their military careers but also when some return to call Idaho home permanently in retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer my sincere congratulations to the Gunfighters and my heartfelt gratitude for their service to our great country, in defense of my freedom and that of my family.</paragraph>
