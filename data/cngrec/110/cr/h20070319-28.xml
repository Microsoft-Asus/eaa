    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today because today marks the 4-year anniversary of the war in Iraq. I would like to offer a moment of silence for the 19 members of my unit that did not make it home from Iraq, and for the thousands of brave Americans that have fallen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this somber occasion, we must commit ourselves to honoring the memories of the fallen, and continue to do right by our troops still fighting.</paragraph>
