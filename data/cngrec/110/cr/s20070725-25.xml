  <narrative>RECOGNITION OF CHAIRMAN ALLEN FOREMAN -- (Senate - July 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9914">S9914</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize the accomplishments of Chairman Allen Foreman, who has recently retired as chairman of the Klamath tribes in Klamath County, OR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During Chairman Foreman's 8-year tenure leading the tribe, he was instrumental in furthering the goals and aspirations of the Klamath tribal members. His leadership and vision were critical in the development of the new tribal headquarters in Chiloquin as well as a new dental, medical clinic and pharmacy and the construction of many new homes for tribal members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Foreman has shown his dedication to the tribe and to the people of Klamath County in many ways. His focus on rural economic development and his respect for our natural resources have earned him high respect in the community. Chairman Foreman is known as a man who can be trusted and a man who will work with anyone to accomplish a common goal for the good of the community. His devotion to the Klamath tribes is evident in the fact that while he has recently retired as chairman of the tribes,  he will remain a member of the Tribal Council at large to continue his service to the tribes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am extremely proud of the successes being exhibited by the Klamath tribes and I have thoroughly enjoyed working with Chairman Foreman. The Klamath tribes have a saying that proclaims, "The Klamath Tribes. ..... Respecting the Past. ..... Living the Present. ..... And Together we can work to build a brighter future!" Chairman Allen Foreman has epitomized this mantra, and I am confident that his successor, Chairman Joseph Kirk, will follow in his footsteps and follow the path  laid out by their Klamath tribes forefathers.</paragraph>
