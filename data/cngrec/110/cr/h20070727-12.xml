    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay respect and honor to Private First Class Daniel Agami from Parkland, Florida, who lost his life this past June while serving in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Private Agami was patrolling in a Humvee with four other soldiers when their vehicle was hit by an IED, an improvised explosive device. Unfortunately, all five of these brave troops were killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Private Agami was a man of great character, known for his devotion to faith and his country. His presence was so strong and his personality so outgoing that the Army planned to feature Private Agami in an upcoming advertising campaign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like me, Private Agami was born in Ohio but later moved to Florida. His parents were surprised by his decision to join the military 2 years ago, but noted that he felt a responsibility to his country, and in the words of his mother, Beth Agami, he "was totally patriotic."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, unfortunately, never had the opportunity to meet Private Agami, but after hearing about the way he approached life and his devotion to our country, I feel like I know him. He is a role model to me and to all citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the family of Private Agami, your beloved son made the ultimate sacrifice to serve our country, and those of us in Florida and the Nation are eternally grateful and will never forget his unfathomable service to our country.</paragraph>
