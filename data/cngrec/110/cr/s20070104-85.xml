  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, finally, I would like to note that nearly 20 years ago, on June 12, 1987, President Ronald Reagan stood at the Berlin Wall, at the Brandenburg Gate, and issued his--issued liberty's--famous challenge to Soviet tyranny:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this Wall!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am submitting a resolution today calling for an artistic rendering of that moment in time to be painted into the Capitol, along with the other significant scenes of our Nation's past. As we walk through the building today, we can see scenes from the Nation's founding, from the Civil War, our westward expansion, even the Moon landing and Challenger astronauts. I would like to also see Reagan at the Brandenburg Gate. I think it would be entirely appropriate to have this image added. It would  be an important reminder of the struggle this Nation undertook. It would stand for the millions of Americans who did their part for nearly half a century in that struggle, both military and civilian. And it would testify to the greatness of our Nation, and the greatness of our 40th President.</paragraph>
