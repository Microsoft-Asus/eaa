    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would also note that the Presiding Officer today is from the State of Montana. It is the first time the distinguished Senator has presided. We congratulate you. And I recognize the State of Montana is bigger than the State of Nevada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember, with a lot of fondness, the first time I campaigned in the State of Montana. I was struck by how big that State is. We flew most all of 2 days around that State and never got from one end to the other. It is a big State, and we are very grateful they have a big Senator representing it.</paragraph>
