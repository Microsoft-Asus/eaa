    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Ellsworth) for his resolution, and I want to join him this morning. And I'm honored to stand here this morning as part of the first National Day of Remembrance for Murder Victims to pay tribute to the memory of those whose lives have been tragically cut short through senseless acts of violence in this country. Let us and their families know that they are not alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course we must continue to devote the resources necessary to the local, State, and Federal levels to protect our communities from falling victim to future criminal acts, but we cannot forget those who have already been victims, particularly the victims of murder and the families that struggle to rebuild their lives after such heinous acts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This day also enables us to recognize and thank those victims assistance organizations, like Parents of Murdered Children, that happen to be headquartered in my district in Cincinnati, Ohio, and the National Center for Victims of Crime, that provide ongoing support to the surviving families. The strength, comfort, and compassion that these organizations provide to families and friends of murder victims is immeasurable and should not go unrecognized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to take a moment today to remember these victims and their families and the organizations that provide assistance.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
