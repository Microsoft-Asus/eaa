    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to talk about something very important--the Special Olympics World Winter Games.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a privilege for all of us in Idaho to be a part of these games as the host for the 2009 worldwide games. And it has been an honor for me personally to be involved with this wonderful organization. I know the people of Idaho are looking forward to welcoming the world to our great State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I especially want to thank Senator Harkin for his help. He has been a tremendous advocate for the Special Olympics. And from what I understand, he is a big fan of the games in his home state of Iowa, where they recently hosted the National Summer Games. Senator, thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we all know that the Special Olympics is a first-class organization. Its sole purpose is to enrich the lives of literally millions of people across the world. Through training and competition, individuals with intellectual disabilities have a chance to become physically fit, productive and respected members of society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, Special Olympics is responsible for much more than games and competition ..... it is about quality of life. The Special Olympics Healthy Athletes Program, developed over a decade ago, focuses on health, fitness, and well-being of people with and without disabilities. Last year this program made it possible to conduct more than 135,000 health screenings. Just this month, at the World Summer Games in China, medical volunteers provided free dental, vision, and hearing exams. Clearly, the  games are more than just a sporting event they provide services to promote better fitness and health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when the Special Olympics asked me to help with the Idaho Winter Games, it is easy to see why I considered it a great honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, hosting the largest multiday winter sports competition ever held in the United States isn't easy--and it isn't cheap. There is a tremendous amount of work going on behind the scenes. It requires a lot of manpower and resources to prepare the infrastructure and organize housing, meals, and transportation for participants from all over the world. As a world-class nonprofit organization, Special Olympics relies mostly on in-kind gifts and services. Raising enough money to pull off such a large  event is a daunting task, to say the least.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why I am pleased that the Senate Appropriations Committee has provided the Idaho Special Olympic Winter Games with some much-needed funding. This critical financial assistance will make these games possible. It will make it possible for some truly remarkable athletes to compete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again I would like to thank both Senator Harkin and Senator Specter for their devotion to the Special Olympics. Their work will make these games a success. And while I am on the floor, I would like to invite my colleagues to come to Idaho--to experience the magic of an Idaho winter and to experience the magic of the Special Olympics.</paragraph>
