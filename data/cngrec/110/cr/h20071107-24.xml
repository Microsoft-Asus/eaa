  <narrative>WELCOME TO FRENCH PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13215]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome French President Nicolas Sarkozy and thank him for addressing the joint session of Congress this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a person of French heritage, I know we are all grateful for his tribute to American veterans. France was our first ally in the American Revolution, as symbolized by the portrait of Marquis de Lafayette here in the Chamber. France remains an important partner in international affairs and a major investor in the American economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful that the midlands of South Carolina is home to three Michelin tire manufacturing plants. The Associated Press has recognized President Sarkozy as a blunt and uncompromising pro-American conservative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With his leadership, I am confident our historic alliance will be strengthened as we pursue common goals of global economic development and face down a common enemy in the global war on terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleagues and our friends of France in promoting our vibrant partnership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
