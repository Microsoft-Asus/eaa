  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="">
    <paragraph>Today, it is my privilege to bring to the floor of the House of Representatives the "Wild Monongahela Act: A National Legacy for West Virginia's Special Places."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is supported by the entire West Virginia delegation: In this body, my colleagues Representatives ALAN MOLLOHAN and SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO, and in the other body, our Senators, ROBERT C. BYRD and JAY ROCKEFELLER.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The pending measure would designate 37,771 acres of Federal land as wilderness within the Monongahela National Forest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Included in this legislation is the expansion of three existing wilderness areas: Cranberry, Dolly Sods and Otter Creek. Additionally, three new wilderness areas would be established: The Big Draft, the Roaring Plains West, and Spice Run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The issue of wilderness has captivated many Americans since the passage of the Wilderness Act in 1964. According to this landmark statute, these are places "where the Earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To be in a wilderness area is, to me, truly a humbling experience. To be part of designating wilderness is even more humbling because wilderness is an effort to retain the landscape as God has created it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Reverend Dennis Sparks, Executive Director of the West Virginia Council of Churches wrote to me, and I quote, "We believe that carefully protecting this wonderful national forest and its wilderness-quality lands not only has a sound biblical basis, but is also the best and most practical course of action for safeguarding the world which we will pass along to our children."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A great many people have worked to make this legislation possible: Matt Keller, Dave Saville, Mary Wimmer, Beth Little, Mayor John Manchester of Lewisburg, West Virginia, Bob Bittner, Jr., Mike Price, as well as the Reverend Sparks. And there are many others with whom I've hiked and with who I've worked on this legislation for which time will not allow me to name them all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to express my appreciation to the Monongahela National Forest Supervisor, Clyde Thompson, as well as to Sammie Lammie, for his excellent map making.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, to the Governor of West Virginia, Joe Manchin, and to the Division of our Natural Resources Director, Frank Jezioro. We have and will continue to work to ensure that appropriate wildlife management activities can take place in the areas designated by this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I submit the following exchange of letters for the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, April 17, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: On April 2, 2008 the Committee on Natural Resources favorably reported an amended version of <bill type="h" number="5151">H.R. 5151</bill>, the "Wild Monongahela Act: A National Legacy for West Virginia's Special Places." As you are aware, the bill was primarily referred to Committee of Natural Resources, while the Agriculture Committee received an additional referral.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5151">H.R. 5151</bill> seeks, among other policy objectives, to designate as "wilderness" certain Federal Lands within the Monongahela National Forest in the State of West Virginia. Clause 1(a) of Rule X confers upon the Agriculture Committee jurisdiction over bills relating to forestry in general and forests other than those created from the public domain. In the past, the Committee on Agriculture has worked cooperatively with the Committee on Natural Resources regarding matters that generally concern  forestry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding that the Committee on Natural Resources wishes to have the House of Representatives consider the bill next week. Given the need to expedite this legislation, I will agree to discharge <bill type="h" number="5151">H.R. 5151</bill> from further consideration by the Committee on Agriculture. I do so with the understanding that this action in no way waives the Committee on Agriculture's jurisdictional interests in the subject matter of the legislation or serves as a precedent for future referrals. Furthermore,  in the event a House-Senate conference is requested on this matter, the Committee on Agriculture reserves the right to seek the appointment of conferees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask that you insert a copy of our exchange letters into the Congressional Record during consideration of this measure on the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank: you very much for your courtesy in this matter and I look forward to continued cooperation between the Committee on Natural Resources and the Committee on Agriculture as we deal with forestry issues in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Collin C. Peterson,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, April 18, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for your letter on April 18, 2008, indicating jurisdictional interests in <bill type="h" number="5151">H.R. 5151</bill>, the "Wild Monongahela Act: A National Legacy for West Virginia's Special Places." As you are aware, the Committee on Natural Resources favorably reported an amended version of the bill on April 2, 2008, and would like to have the House of Representatives consider the legislation next week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I acknowledge your jurisdictional interests in the bill, and note that the Committee on Natural Resources and the Committee on Agriculture have had a history of working cooperatively on matters that generally concern forestry. I appreciate your willingness to discharge the bill without further consideration by the Agriculture Committee and understand that this action will in no way waive your Committee's jurisdictional interests in the subject matter of the legislation or serve as a precedent  for future referrals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, in the event that a conference with the Senate is requested on this matter, I would support naming Agriculture Committee members to the conference committee. A copy of our exchange letters regarding this bill will be inserted into the Congressional Record during floor consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for your courtesy in this matter and I look forward to continued cooperation between our respective Committees as we deal with forestry issues in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With warm regards, I am</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nick J. Rahall II,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400116" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlelady from West Virginia (Mrs. Capito).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400061" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today on Earth Day in support of <bill type="h" number="5151">H.R. 5151</bill>, the Wild Monongahela Act: A National Legacy for West Virginia's Special Places, introduced by my colleague from West Virginia's Third District and the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, Congressman Nick Rahall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of this important legislation, and I  commend the chairman for all of his hard work on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1964, Congress enacted the Wilderness Act that permanently protected some of the most natural and undisturbed places in America. Today the U.S. Forest Service preserves the natural and cultural resources and values of the forest system, including those of the Monongahela National Forest for the enjoyment, education and inspiration of this and future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>West Virginia's wilderness is part of our history and heritage, and it is passed on as a legacy. This bipartisan bill will protect approximately 38,000 acres of the Mon Forest in West Virginia through the designation of three additional wilderness areas and expansion of three existing Federal wilderness areas including: Big Draft, Cranberry Expansion, Dolly Sods Expansion, Dry Fork Expansion, Roaring Plains West and Spice Run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>West Virginia's national forest provides an excellent outdoor experience with our State's majestic mountains, winding rivers and superb hunting, camping, fishing, backpacking and other activities. Protecting these additional acres of pristine forest will ensure that future generations will be able to enjoy the natural beauty of our home State of West Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last several months I've engaged in discussion with many of my constituents, many whom are avid hunters, anglers, mountain bikers and outdoorsmen who have a unique and vested interest in the impact of the wilderness designation on their local community. The people of this area are well acquainted with wilderness, and <bill type="h" number="5151">H.R. 5151</bill> reflects their desire to preserve their natural treasures, while maintaining important flexibility for the local residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill is vitally important to guaranteeing that future generations of Americans can experience the natural wonder and beauty of West Virginia. I applaud Chairman Rahall and his staff for all of their hard work on this bill and all those in West Virginia who have seen it come to this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support the legislation, and I encourage each of them to experience firsthand the pristine natural beauty of West Virginia and the Mon National Forest.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. But, in conclusion, I want to commend the staff of our Natural Resources Committee as well, Mr. Jim Zoia, who's been with me for numerous years and knows our people in West Virginia, has been with this legislation almost daily.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rick Healy, our chief counsel. And I wish as well to commend the ranking minority member on my committee, Mr. Don Young, for his assistance and willingness to work with us on this as well, and today's acting ranking member, Mr. Jimmy Duncan, for his help on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have no further requests for time, and I'll reserve, pending any further requests that the ranking member has.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400116" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5151">H.R. 5151</bill> will designate portions of the Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia as wilderness, and it is my understanding that Members of Congress whose districts are affected support the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although we should give considerable deference to those who have been elected to represent the people in the area, I do not necessarily agree that wilderness designation is always the wisest conservation decision we can make. Wilderness designation is the most restrictive policy we can impose on an area, and there are often far better, more creative ways to conserve our forests and other natural areas. In many instances, it is a mistake to foreclose active management options that can improve  fish and game habitat, increase recreational access and lessen the severity of wildfires. And to protect our economic well-being, provide jobs for young people and protect our national security, our country is going to need continued access to the rich resources our own public lands provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We now have over 100 million acres in wilderness areas, and we keep adding to that at a record level. And we are very close to getting to the point where that's beginning to hurt us economically at a time when we don't need more blows to our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevertheless, I do wish the people of West Virginia good luck living around these wilderness areas, and I know that they, like the people of my State, will in the long run prove to be better guardians of their mountains, rivers and wildlife than bureaucrats in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield back, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Rahall) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="5151">H.R. 5151</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <narrative>The question was taken.</narrative>
  <chair> In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.</chair>
