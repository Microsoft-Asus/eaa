  <speaking speaker="300014" topic="CONGRATULATING KEVIN WEBB">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Mr. Kevin Webb of Glasgow, KY. Mr. Webb was recently chosen to be one of eight speakers at the first ever Ticket to Work Partners Summit held in Louisville, KY.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In March 2008 the Social Security Administration launched the Ticket to Work Partners Summit to bring together over 400 of Social Security's partners who actively engage Social Security disability beneficiaries in work through the Ticket to Work Program. Mr. Webb was chosen to be one of eight speakers nationally to discuss how they have benefited from this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the help of the Social Security Administration, Mr. Webb was able to start his own business in April 2006. Today he is a proud co-owner with his father, Ron Taylor, of Webb/Taylor Horseback Riding and Boarding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to becoming a successful business owner, Mr. Webb was faced with a number of difficult challenges in finding employment. Despite all of the setbacks and obstacles he had to overcome, Mr. Webb never gave up on his dreams and continued to search for a job that made him happy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Webb applied for a grant given to five individuals each year by the Kentucky Council on Developmental Disabilities and the State vocation rehabilitation for startup funds for new businesses. With the grant and a fully funded Plan for Achieving Self Support from the Social Security Administration, Mr. Webb and his father were able to launch the Webb/Taylor Horseback Riding and Boarding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Besides starting his own business, Mr. Webb has also worked with elected officials in the Kentucky State Legislature on behalf of individuals with disabilities. In 2003, the Kentucky State Legislature passed the Kevin Webb and Kim Brown Self-Determination Act to require the Commission on Services and Supports for Individuals with Mental Retardation and Other Developmental Disabilities to make recommendations to the Department of Medicaid Services for the implementation of a self-determination  model for individuals who are receiving services through the Supports for Community Living waiver program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to congratulate Mr. Webb for his hard work and dedication as he celebrates the two year anniversary of opening Webb/Taylor Horseback Riding and Boarding. Mr. Webb is truly an inspiration to all Kentuckians and I wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.</paragraph>
