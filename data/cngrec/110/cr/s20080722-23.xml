  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize a community in North Dakota that recently celebrated its 125th anniversary. On July 4-6, the residents of Havana gathered to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Havana is a town of nearly 100 inhabitants. It is located in southeast North Dakota. Originally, the town was named Weber, but it was subsequently changed to Havana to avoid confusion with a town of a similar sounding name on the same railroad line. Havana was incorporated in 1904. By 1913, the town claimed a population of 450. In its early days, Havana had numerous general stores, pool halls, hotels, businesses dedicated to agriculture, a newspaper and an opera house.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Havana offers its citizens plenty of leisure activities. Residents can enjoy a game of baseball at Williamson Park. The town maintains a grocery store and a post office. The Havana Civic Center hosts events for Havana's citizens. One of the favorite gathering places of residents of Havana is the town's caf&#xE9;, the Farmer's Inn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Havana's anniversary celebration began with a parade. In addition to many other activities, the community hosted a craft show, a banquet at the Havana Civic Center, a street dance, and fireworks display. Havana held a music festival, featuring bluegrass and gospel music, on the last day of the celebration. One of the highlights of Havana's festivities was the All School Reunion, which brought together former classmates of Havana School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Havana, ND and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well in the future. By honoring Havana and all the other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places like Havana that have helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why this community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Havana has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
