  <narrative>THE BIGGEST BURDEN OF THE IRAQ CONFLICT -- (House of Representatives - March 31, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1793]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400436" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm really glad to be back in the House. I've been away for over 6 weeks because of back surgery. I've been patched up, and I'm going to be just fine. I'm not worried about myself. But I'm worried, and I hope every Member of the House is worried about the hundreds of thousands of American soldiers and civilians who have been injured in the conflict in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 30,000, probably many, many more of our brave troops have been wounded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many have injuries that will rack their bodies and their minds for the rest of their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet Vice President Cheney said last week that President Bush carries the biggest burden of this conflict. Tell that to the widows and widowers, Mr. Vice President. Tell that to the families who have been devastated by the injuries to their loved ones. Tell that to the children who see their mother or father in a hospital bed without a limb or with a terrible head wound. Tell that to the veterans who have not gotten the care they need and the care they deserve, the care we promised them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of our soldiers in Iraq, Lieutenant Sean Walsh, wrote a piece for Time magazine recently about the human costs of the occupation. He wrote that his fellow soldiers have become his family and that three of them have died. And he asked the question, "What is worth the lives of three of your loved ones?" It is a good question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I would like to ask every Member of this House who supports the occupation the very same question: Is our occupation of Iraq worth the lives of three of your loved ones?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must also remember the Iraq civilians who have been injured. We seem to forget them, and that is truly a disgrace. According to the best estimates, anywhere from 80,000 to 150,000 civilians have been injured. And the real number, the real number is certainly much, much higher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What kind of health care are they, the Iraqi civilians, getting? The International Committee of the Red Cross reported last month that public hospitals in Iraq now provide 30,000 beds. Mr. Speaker, that is less than half of the 80,000 that are needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, 2,200 doctors and nurses have been killed since the year 2003, and another 250 have been kidnapped. And the current conflict has worsened the impact of the previous war and the years of international sanctions. Of the 34,000 doctors registered in Iraq in 1990, 20,000 have fled the country, some by choice and others by force. What about their burden, Mr. Vice President?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, the administration continues to play its cynical game with troop levels. It is clear that the administration intends to keep 140,000 troops in Iraq until it leaves office in order to put an artificial lid on this violence. That way, the outgoing administration can say that it improved the security situation and that we are on the road to victory in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the truth is, all that has been achieved is a temporary military and  political stalemate, new explosions of violence coming as I stand here speaking on the floor of the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while we continue to be bogged down in a civil war in Iraq, a conflict that began centuries before 9/11, the real enemy, al Qaeda, grows stronger in its cozy, safe haven in Pakistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration is often criticized for not having an exit strategy in Iraq. But in my view, the reason the President never had an exit strategy is because he never intended to exit Iraq. Permanent occupation has always been his game plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, it's up to the Congress to implement the will of the American people and end the occupation with a responsible redeployment of our troops. The best way to honor those who have died or have been injured in this occupation is to ensure that more won't die and more won't be injured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I will continue to speak up for our brave troops and for the innocent Iraqis who are, despite what the Vice President may think, the ones who are carrying the biggest burden.</paragraph>
