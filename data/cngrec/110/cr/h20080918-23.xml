    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as the stock market plunges, financial institutions fail and the economic pain Americans feel grows, our Republican colleagues' only answer is to drill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Drilling won't help the 2 million Americans who have lost jobs in the last year. Drilling won't protect 46 million Americans without health insurance, 7 million more than when George Bush took office. Drilling won't help nearly 6 million people who have slipped into poverty. Drilling won't bring back the huge surplus that George Bush inherited and squandered. And drilling won't help the 3 million families who have lost their homes to foreclosure in the last 3 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite their cries for drilling, our Republican colleagues voted against accelerated drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve, already under lease, and against drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf. In fact, the drilling they do support wouldn't produce new oil for at least 8 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In truth, they don't want to help American families. They only want to distract public attention from eight disastrous years under George Bush.</paragraph>
