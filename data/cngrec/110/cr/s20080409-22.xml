  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="IN MEMORY OF BRENT A. LOVRIEN">
    <paragraph>Madam President, flags across California flew at half-mast recently to honor the life of firefighter Brent A. Lovrien. The city of Los Angeles and the firefighter community lost an exemplary leader when Firefighter Lovrien was killed in the line of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A 10-year veteran of the Los Angeles Fire Department and a member of platoon "A" at Fire Station 95, Firefighter Lovrien is the first Los Angeles City firefighter to die in the line of duty since 2004. I would like to take a few moments to recognize his many important accomplishments and the impact he made as a leader in both his personal and professional life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Firefighter Lovrien was a leader to his fellow firefighters and a highly respected leader in his community. He has been called an inspiration by his superior officers and has been a mentor to his fellow firefighters. Firefighter Lovrien has also been recognized by residents of Fire Station 95's local community for his efforts to protect and improve their quality of life. Lovrien was an asset to his community and his presence will truly be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Firefighter Lovrien is survived by his father, mother, and brother--to whom I send my heartfelt condolences. He leaves a lasting legacy of caring and compassion that serves as a model to us all. Firefighters are too often called upon to protect our communities while putting themselves in grave danger. Despite this, they are the first to go into burning buildings, or similar dangerous situations, all to save lives and property. Firefighter Lovrien stepped forward and paid the ultimate price for  our protection. We will miss his service and dedication to the city of Los Angeles and the firefighting community.</paragraph>
