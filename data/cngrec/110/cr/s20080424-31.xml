  <narrative>MEDIA MARKET CONCENTRATION -- (Senate - April 24, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3389">S3389</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to mention, this morning out of the Senate Commerce Committee, thanks to Senator Inouye's and Senator Stevens' support of my legislation, we passed legislation that will veto a rule that was passed by the Federal Communications Commission that allows for more consolidation in America's media.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Communications Commission decided they want more concentration in the media, despite the fact that most of what Americans hear, see, and read every single day is directed by about five or six major corporations in America. They think we need more concentration. So they passed a rule that says it is going to be OK to allow newspapers to buy television stations in the same city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had a prohibition against that action for a while. It is called cross-ownership. They did their rule. The Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission was very anxious to get this rule done and serve whatever master he was serving. They did their rule, but today we passed a veto resolution out of the Commerce Committee, a disapproval of the rule by the Federal Communications Commission that would allow greater concentration in the media.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The last thing we need is more concentration in the media. We have all these supporters that come to the Senate floor who say: What are you talking about? We have all these new outlets. Go to the Internet. See how many sites there are. Go to cable television. See how many channels there are. I say: Yes, a lot of new choices but from the same ventriloquist, the same source.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One guy testified before the Commerce Committee and said, for example, on cable television in my office, 48 channels are on basic tier and 42 of those channels belong to the same five or six major companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That bill will come to the floor of the Senate because it is a privileged piece of legislation. My resolution of disapproval, passed by the Commerce Committee today, will come to the Senate as a privileged resolution. It will be on the calendar now. I am going to consult with Senator Reid, and I will visit with the minority, and find a time to bring it up and have a vote to disapprove the rule that was enacted by the Federal Communications Commission, which, in my judgment, stands logic  on its head.</paragraph>
