    <paragraph>Good morning, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the House will vote to override the President's veto of the SCHIP bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the beginning of this debate some months ago, I said that if America is the greatest country in the world, then we ought to guarantee that all of our children have health insurance. Greatness is not measured by the size of our military industrial complex. Greatness is measured by whether we can provide health insurance for 10 million American children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the President has said no, but according to all the polls, the American people say yes. Majorities in both Houses have said yes. Governors have said yes. Private charities have said yes, that we ought to provide health insurance for children in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a matter of a market fix. Small businesses cannot afford to provide health insurance. Working families, many of them, cannot afford to buy health insurance on the private market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, this bill provides a guarantee of dental coverage, because in America, the greatest country, children should not die because they don't have dental coverage. The bill provides dental coverage and mental health coverage. It's simple: We're the greatest country. We ought to provide health insurance for all our children.</paragraph>
