  <speaking speaker="400194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on October 25, 2007, the YWCA of Northwest Georgia will hold a vigil on Marietta Square in my hometown to commemorate Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I wish to express my gratitude for the work of the YWCA of Northwest Georgia and its executive director, Holly Comer, as they bring awareness to this important issue and its impact on our community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The YWCA of Northwest Georgia opened the doors to the first domestic violence shelter in Cobb County in 1978 in an effort to end domestic violence in our State, our communities, and our homes. A home should be a place of stability, comfort, and love. Domestic violence shatters this important foundation. The terrible tragedies that result from domestic violence destroy lives and insult the dignity of women, men, and children. I believe I represent all Georgians when I say thank you to the YWCA  of Northwest Georgia for its hard work to combat domestic violence and help those who have been victimized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful for the social service providers, advocates, counselors, and many others who provide care for the victims. I am also grateful to the law enforcement personnel and others who work to bring offenders to justice. As we recognize Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we are reminded of the important service these individuals provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Domestic violence has no place in our society, and I am strongly committed to addressing domestic violence and helping those who have been victimized. By working together with the YWCA of Northwest Georgia and its dedicated staff, we can build a Georgia where every home honors the value and dignity of its loved ones.</paragraph>
