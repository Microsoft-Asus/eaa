  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO BRAD SCOTT -- (Senate - December 08, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10804">S10804</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr President, today I recognize and pay tribute to a good friend and longtime colleague in public service: Brad Scott.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have known Brad for more than 20 years, first as a dedicated and effective employee, and later as a visionary Government administrator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 9, 2009, he will step down from his post as a regional administrator of the General Service Administration after 8 years of innovative and dedicated service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We sometimes joke that the term "Government efficiency" is an oxymoron, but not when Brad is in charge. He can make things happen. At a time when political concerns seem to dominate much of the landscape, Brad has worked across the aisle to get things done by focusing on the common good and doing what is best for Missouri and the Heartland Region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that in the Federal bureaucracy, it is much harder to complete a project than to derail it or to do nothing at all. Red tape is an all-too-real phenomenon. But since Brad came to the GSA in 2001, he has not stopped building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2001, he brought a set of successful business policies to a GSA region that was suffering from underutilized space and low return on investment. He also worked hard to build consensus between local communities, the private sector and Government on large-scale projects. He was able to revitalize blighted areas in many of our largest cities by constructing or renovating iconic buildings that now enhance local economic development. He also permanently strengthened these local communities by creating  and maintaining jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brad's accomplishments are too numerous to name. Several of his major contributions include: the construction of First IRS Center in Kansas City, new Federal courthouses in Cape Girardeau and Jefferson City, and the conversion of the Old St. Louis Post Office into a heavily utilized State building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brad's long list of accomplishments speaks to his vision, dedication, and uncanny ability to guide key development projects through the bureaucratic maze.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Losing Brad Scott as Regional GSA Administrator will be a real blow to Missouri but the State has been fortunate to have him in that role for so many years. I know that he will continue to be an active participant in issues facing Missouri and the region just as he has always been.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brad, thank you for your service and I look forward to many more good things to come.</paragraph>
