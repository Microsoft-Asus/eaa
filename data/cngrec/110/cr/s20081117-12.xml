  <narrative>EXTENSION OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS -- (Senate - November 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10538">S10538</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, when I think about the debate over extending unemployment insurance, some questions come to mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does anyone in Congress want more American families to lose their homes?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does anyone in Congress want more American children to go to bed hungry?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does anyone in the House or Senate want more American families to stop paying their heating bills, to delay their credit card payments, to skip out on their health care bills?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does anybody in the House or Senate want consumer spending to slow even further, dragging our economy from recession to something even worse?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Assuming the answer to any of these questions is no, then voting to extend unemployment insurance for current job seekers should not be a fight, it should be a formality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Chamber approved a massive bailout of the financial industry, not because investment bankers might have to forsake that second or third Mercedes, not because Wall Street bonuses might drop from eight figures to seven figures. We approved that bailout because when credit markets freeze, businesses cannot get working capital, and when businesses cannot get working capital, Americans lose jobs, and when Americans lose jobs, their families suffer, their communities suffer, and our Nation suffers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It all comes down to Main Street Americans who want to work, who want to pay their bills, who want to take care of their families; their well-being is tied to the well-being of our economy and our Nation. Unemployment insurance is the mechanism by which Americans looking for jobs but who have lost their jobs can sustain their families, can keep their financial commitments, can afford the tools needed to find a new job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard too many cases where people could not even fill their gas tanks to go out searching for jobs, particularly in rural northwest and rural southeast Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Extending unemployment insurance is key to getting the economy going. It injects dollars into the economy and helps people meet their obligations, raise their kids, and do what they need to do in the community. It is one of the most important and immediate ways to stimulate the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Relief for financial institutions was intended to prevent massive job loss, to stabilize the economy, to stem foreclosures. Extending unemployment insurance is intended to promote job growth, to stabilize the economy, and to stem foreclosures. It is the smart thing to do. It is the right thing to do. It holds one important advantage over the financial bailout. The people who benefit directly from an extension of unemployment compensation, from an extension of unemployment insurance, live on Main  Street, with not a single Wall Street CEO in sight.</paragraph>
