  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN JOE WAGGONNER -- (Senate - October 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12928">S12928</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with sadness that I come to the floor today to pay respects to one of our former congressional leaders who passed away earlier this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Joe Waggonner represented the Fourth District of Louisiana from 1961 to 1979. Literally up until the last weeks of his life, he stayed very active in the Fourth District. He was active on what went on there both at a political level and a civic level, lending his voice to many important efforts in the community--and I emphasize literally up until the last few weeks of his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was always engaged, always open, always welcoming to leaders coming into the Shreveport area. He was not from the big city in that district, Shreveport, LA; he was from a small town called Plain Dealing. It was actually a very fitting name for this Congressman because he was a very straightforward, plain-speaking, progressive-leaning Congressman from this small town called Plain Dealing of only a thousand people. That small community of loving and supportive families, made up of farmers and  small business owners and churchgoers, provided a great foundation for Joe Waggonner as he grew and came into his professional life and then became a Congressman from this small town. He was down to earth, he was honest, and he was a Congressman who represented his constituents with a lot of enthusiasm</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a natural leader. He was a lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and after returning from service there, he began his political career as a school board member. Throughout his career, he carried an enthusiasm and excitement and energy for school issues and for the children of the Fourth District in our State. In 1961, he won a special election after longtime U.S. Representative Overton Brooks died in office and again continued that great tradition of representing the  Fourth District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can't name all the things Joe did for our State. It would be such a long list. But there are a few things that cannot be overlooked. Because of Congressman Waggonner's work in his congressional district, Barksdale Air Force Base is now one of the largest and strongest Air Force bases and is home to the mighty 8th Air Force. This base had been scheduled to close some decades ago, but because of his efforts and others, led by many of the business and civic leaders in that district but primarily  because of this Congressman, Barksdale is not only open, but it is now going to be the proud home of U.S. Strategic Command's Cyber Command.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joe was also known for being a pioneer of interstate highways in their early days, wanting to put Shreveport on the map. Shreveport and Bossier City today are growing in large measure because of his fierce advocacy for ports and airports and transportation hubs, as well as the Barksdale Air Force Base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along with my predecessor, Senator Bennett Johnson, Joe's efforts created a whole new image for Shreveport because of the work they did regarding the Red River. With their hard work they opened it to trade and transportation. Also, this river is now home to several "floating" casinos that have transformed Bossier City and Shreveport, LA, from very sleepy small towns  to really booming commercial developments attracting gaming interests from all over  the region and contributing mightily to the economy in north Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I personally say many thanks to his family--his wife Mary Ruth Carter Waggonner, his two children, Carol and David, and his three grandchildren--for the contributions they made supporting a man through many careers in public service in Louisiana. David is a personal friend and I know him and his son, Peter, are mourning the loss of their father and grandfather. He was a man of tremendous faith. He made Louisiana proud. He served us with distinction and with honor. He will be remembered as a very  distinguished and dignified leader for our State, particularly north Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joe Waggonner was a straightforward, straight-thinking man from Plain Dealing, LA. He was a graduate of Louisiana Tech University and was very proud of his alma mater and very proud to call Plain Dealing home. His leadership and friendship will be missed.</paragraph>
