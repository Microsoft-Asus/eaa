  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation is similar to the bill we just considered in that it also deals with an exemption from the Non-Intercourse Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our colleague, Representative Dale Kildee, introduced this measure to exempt the conveyance of non-trust lands made by Tribe located in Michigan. In this particular case, the law is preventing this Tribe from fully engaging in non-gaming economic development. The pending measure is necessary so that the Tribe can sell fee lands bought for investment purposes and to otherwise engage in real estate investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</paragraph>
