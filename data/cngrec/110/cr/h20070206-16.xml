    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as debate continues surrounding President Bush's new way forward in Iraq, I hope all sides are heard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a 31-year veteran of the South Carolina Army National Guard. I have four sons serving in the military, the eldest of whom served for a year in Iraq. I sit on the Armed Services Committee, and I have visited Iraq six times and Afghanistan twice. I am committed to my family and our Nation's survival and prosperity, all of which will be threatened should we not triumph in the global war on terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As elected public officials, Members of Congress have an obligation to debate war strategy and exercise congressional oversight. If by conscience they disagree with the President's direction, they have a responsibility to put forth an alternative plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Political posturing in the form of nonbinding resolutions, however, brings nothing to the debate regarding the protection of American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
