  <narrative>RISING GAS PRICES ARE NOT THE SOLUTION AMERICANS WANT FROM THE DEMOCRATS -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2559]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in a press release on April 24, 2006, then Leader Pelosi, now Speaker Pelosi said, Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down the skyrocketing cost of gasoline. In an op-ed penned by my friend from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel), he claimed that their success is because Democrats realize the anxiety of stagnating wages, the cost of health care, education, and even gasoline and vowed to address their concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, they addressed their concerns. Gas prices are up. When the Democrats took over, gas prices were $2.33. Now they are $3.53. We call this the Pelosi Premium. Add the 50 cent gas tax for climate change, consumers would be paying $4.03. And when gas prices reach $4 this summer, add 50 cents for climate change; we will be paying $4.53 for a gallon of gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's not the type of change that the suburbs in America bargained for when they allowed Democrats to get this Chamber.</paragraph>
