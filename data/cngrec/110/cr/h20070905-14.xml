    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, 10 years ago the Children's Health Insurance Program was instituted. Since then, 6 million children have been given access to private health care insurance in this country. It was absolutely the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But new evidence from the Census Bureau released last week suggests that we are now slipping backwards. The number of children without health insurance coverage in this country increased from 8 million in 2005 to 8.7 million in 2006. That is why we passed 4 weeks ago the CHAMP Act which would increase insurance coverage for children to an additional 5 million children in this country. That's the direction we need to be going in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the President is threatening to veto the CHAMP Act. I hope the President will reconsider, stop posturing on this issue, and do the right thing by America's children.</paragraph>
