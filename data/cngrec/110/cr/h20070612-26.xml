  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we are hearing illegal immigration is a big debate. There is a lot of passion on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, Congress took the right step in passing the Secure Fence Act. It was the right thing to do. It puts 800 miles of fencing in place, both physical and electronic borders, on our southern border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, authorizing it is one thing, but paying for it is another matter. That duty has fallen to the new liberal leadership here in the House. Even though they have increased Homeland Security spending by $2.4 billion, a lot of that is going to go into global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have cut funding for the fence by $187 million, compared to last year's budget. You are going to hear a lot about this as we begin our appropriations process today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we work on this Homeland Security bill, they will claim to have budgeted $1 billion for the fence, but they are withholding $700 million of that while we go through bureaucratic red tape. We have got to be certain we don't hurt the environment, all the while 4,500 illegal immigrants cross the southern border every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is disgraceful. Do not delay the fence. Fund it. Take action in the appropriate matter. The hold-on-to-your-wallet Congress is at it. Stand up for the fence.</paragraph>
