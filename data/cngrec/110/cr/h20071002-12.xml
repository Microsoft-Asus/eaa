  <narrative>IN MEMORY OF HARRY SHULER DENT -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11075]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Harry Shuler Dent passed away Friday. The Charleston Post and Courier recognized him as the father of the present-day South Carolina Republican Party and White House southern strategist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lee Bandy of Columbia's The State outlined Harry Dent's successful career as a journalist, chief of staff for Senator Strom Thurmond, State Republican Chairman, White House Deputy Counsel, and founder of a multinational lay ministry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was grateful to see firsthand Harry's achievements. Under his leadership, the South Carolina Republican Party grew in the 1960s from no officeholders to having majorities in the State legislature, congressional delegation and Statewide offices. In Romania I watched his ministry take action and provide medical equipment to a local hospital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His greatest achievement was to marry his high school sweetheart, Betty Francis Dent. In their 56 years of marriage, they produced four outstanding children, Harry, Jr., Jack, Dolly and Ginny, along with nine grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a political adviser, mission director and dedicated family man, Harry Dent has made an extraordinary difference to the people of South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
