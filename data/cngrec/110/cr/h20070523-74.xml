  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412213" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Constitution Caucus, I am convinced that today, at a time when our Nation lags behind other countries in math and science testing and the Federal Government has a larger role in education than ever before, this Congress must find a way to give our schools greater flexibility, reduce the bureaucracy involved in education, and ensure these opportunities really are being given to our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In years past Congress has attempted to solve problems in education by simply throwing piles of Federal money into the education system. The original purpose of No Child Left Behind was to return some education policymaking authority to the States. Unfortunately, during the process of crafting, passing, and enacting this legislation, No Child Left Behind took the form of a massive spending bill that increased the Federal Government's presence in classrooms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a December 22, 2006 editorial in the Detroit News stated, "What our Federal legislators come up with in the Nation's Capital doesn't always translate well into the classroom."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The editorial continues: "Michigan should have the flexibility to decide how and when to measure student progress."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My daughter-in-law is a hardworking and talented teacher who has experienced firsthand the problems No Child Left Behind creates for teachers, parents, and students. As a classroom teacher forced to teach to the tests required by local, State, and No Child  Left Behind, she actually considered quitting because of the paperwork and restrictions imposed upon her. She struggled to have time to give individual attention to each of her "special needs" students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ironically, she obtained her teaching position due to her performance the year prior as a permanent substitute teacher in a classroom. Because she was not required to fill out all the forms and paperwork required by No Child Left Behind, she excelled and the school offered her a permanent position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In its origin, No Child Left Behind attempted to provide greater school choice and reduce Washington's involvement in education. But instead this expensive and largely unsuccessful legislation has broadened the scope of the Federal Government's role in education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Enshrined in our Constitution is the 10th amendment, which reads, "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved for the States respectively, or to the people." Federal control of education is listed nowhere in the Constitution. And in accordance with the 10th amendment, education should be the responsibility of State and local governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because I believe each child's educational path should be determined by a child's parents and not by the Federal Government, I am an original cosponsor of the A-Plus Act. The A-Plus Act would give States, teachers and parents the freedom and authority to determine what educational path a student should take.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As part of this legislation, States can opt out of Federal programs, and State leaders can decide how to use Federal education funds to improve student achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all are seeking the best possible educational opportunities for our children, and the way to achieve this is to let States and local communities be accountable for academic achievement and educational reforms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield back, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
