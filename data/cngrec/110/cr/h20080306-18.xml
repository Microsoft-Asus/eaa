  <chair> Members are advised there are 2 minutes remaining in this vote.</chair>
  <chair/>
  <chair>So the amendment was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair>The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.</chair>
  <chair> The question is on the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair> Under the rule, the Committee rises.</chair>
  <chair>Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Pastor) having assumed the chair, Mr. Holden, Acting Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (<bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill>) to reauthorize and reform the national service laws, pursuant to House Resolution 1015, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted by the Committee of the Whole.</chair>
  <chair> Under the rule, the previous question is ordered.</chair>
  <chair>Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amendment.</chair>
  <chair>The amendment was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair> The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.</chair>
  <chair>The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time.</chair>
  <chair> Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>In its current form I am.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Clerk will report the motion to recommit.</chair>
  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative> Mr. Daniel E. Lungren of California moves to recommit the bill, <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill>, to the Committee on Education and Labor with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the text of the bill <bill type="h" number="3773">H.R. 3773</bill> as passed by the Senate on February 12, 2008. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;POINT OF ORDER</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I raise a point of order that the motion to recommit contains nongermane instructions in violation of clause 7, rule XVI. The instructions in the motion to recommit address an unrelated matter within the jurisdiction of a committee not represented in the underlying bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I wish to be heard on the point of order.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate the gentleman has raised this point of order rather than allowing a straight up-or-down vote on the Senate-passed FISA legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me speak specifically to the point of order and why, in fact, this motion to recommit is in order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The underlying purpose of the germaneness rule is that it "prevents the presentation to the House of propositions that might not reasonably be anticipated and for which it might not be properly prepared." I cite to 8 Cannon, section 2993. That is clearly not the case here in that this body has dealt extensively with the subject matter of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. And, in fact, we were informed by the majority that we were to be prepared to vote on that this week.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the scheduling of the House is not the subject of this point of order. I raised a point of order that the motion addresses the jurisdiction of committees not represented in the underlying bill. Neither the Judiciary Committee or the Intelligence Committee is represented in the underlying bill, not the schedule of the House.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair will continue to hear the gentleman from California, Representative LUNGREN, discuss the point of order.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, despite the difference in titles of <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill> and <bill type="h" number="3773">H.R. 3773</bill> relating to the motion, that is not controlling under Deschler-Brown, chapter 28, section 24. As a matter of  fact, it refers to the fundamental purpose of the motion. The fundamental purpose of this motion does relate to <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill>, as required by sections 935 and 936 of the House manual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report on <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill> from the gentleman's committee states clearly in its statement of purpose of the bill found on page 57 of that report that the legislation seeks to emphasize, and I quote, "the critical role of service in meeting the national priorities of emergency and disaster preparedness; and improves program integrity." That is from the report on the bill from the gentleman's committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, the critical issue of homeland security provides the required nexus between the subject matters of <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill> and the motions as required under sections 935 and 936 of the House manual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, I would argue, it is clear that the subject matter requirements of section 935 and 936 of the House manual are satisfied. A specific section of the legislation brought to the floor by the gentleman's committee relating to "Emergency and Disaster Preparedness" provides on page 71 of the gentleman's committee report that "H.R. 2857 supports the role of service in addressing emergency and disaster preparedness." These are the words from the gentleman's committee's report. "In addition,  this program may engage Federal, State, and local stakeholders to collaborate to achieve a more effective response to issue public safety, public health, emergencies and disasters."</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I insist upon my point of order. The gentleman again is speaking to the scheduling of the floor of the House. The bill, in its entirety, speaks to national voluntary service. The gentleman, I guess, is talking about the intelligence service. And the fact of the matter is, under the point of order there is nothing in this legislation within the jurisdiction of the committees, for the motion to recommit, of the Intelligence Committee or the Judiciary  Committee, and I insist upon my point of order.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>May I continue my response?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair will continue to hear the gentleman from California as long as he confines his remarks to the point of order.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>I was attempting to specify the germaneness, quoting specifically from the language of the committee report justifying support for this bill. I did not bring up public safety, public health, emergencies and disasters and effective response thereto. That is the premise contained in the bill and the committee report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if we are to be able to respond to public safety, emergencies, and disasters, it does not limit it in the language of the gentleman's committee report to natural disasters. It therefore includes man-made disasters, of which we are very, very cognizant. And 9/11 is perhaps the greatest example. So the bill itself justifies its existence in that the individuals, under the ambit of the bill, to support responses for public safety, public health, emergencies, and disasters are affected  in very specific ways by our capacity, our capacity, to determine beforehand what the nature of the disasters and emergencies would be and therefore allow us to array our individuals under this bill in concert, as is stated by the gentleman's report, to collaborate with Federal, State, and local stakeholders. In that way my amendment is very much germane to the main purpose of the bill and the specifics of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the language of <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill> emphasizes the ability to deploy the National Civilian Community Corps to emergencies and disasters. It does not limit it to natural emergencies or disasters, therefore including terrorist attacks.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I insist on my point of order. Again, had we been involved with the committees of jurisdiction that the gentleman is referring to, the bill would have been referred by the Parliamentarian to those committees, and it was not. And let me just inform the gentleman. I know he's been out for a couple of days and he comes back with great vigor, and I admire his arguments. But there is nothing within the programs of Teach for America or the Boys and Girls  Club of America or the Big Brothers Big Sisters program or the YouthBuild or the National Council on Aging or the Senior Citizen Nutrition Program or the American Red Cross, there is nothing in those programs that require that they eavesdrop or wiretap anybody's phones before they can</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair will allow the gentleman from California 2 minutes to close his argument.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the gentleman says, with some humor in his voice, that we ought not to be considering the question of wiretapping. That is not the question we bring before us today. The question we bring before of us today and why this is germane is whether or not we have the ability to listen in on those who would kill us and therefore prepare for these disasters before they occur and, more than that, prevent them.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from California is required to speak to the point of order.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>I am speaking to the point of order.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The chair has estimated that the gentleman would need 2 minutes to conclude his argument, and 1 minute remains.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman must speak to the point of order which has been made with respect to the fact that there is nothing in this committee speaking to those jurisdictions.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair is willing to hear the gentleman from California for another minute to conclude his argument on the point of order.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, to suggest that intelligence gathered to prevent disaster has nothing to do with the ability of those we are asking under this bill to respond to disaster reminds one of the comment in literature years ago when one was confronted with the incongruity of the law and that person responded by saying: The law, sir, is an ass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would not suggest we are at that point here, but I would suggest this: for anyone to say that, to blind ourselves to the information that would allow us to prevent disasters and prepare for the disasters, to say that that is irrelevant to the debate today shows how irrelevant the debate today is to the needs of the people of the State of California, the Nation, and, frankly, our allies. It is germane, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The chair has heard the gentlemen's argument.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair will hears individual Members in turn. They may not yield to one another. They may not interrupt one another except by proper objection concerning relevance.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I insist upon my point of order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I appreciate that perhaps there's some confusion on the other side of the aisle between the Big Brothers of this program and Big Brother that you're thinking about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I insist upon my point of order.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair is prepared to rule.</chair>
  <chair>As the Chair most recently ruled on March 5, 2008, the instructions in the motion to recommit address a matter unrelated to the issues addressed in the underlying bill, and within the jurisdiction of committees not represented in the underlying bill. The instructions are therefore not germane, and the point of order is sustained. The motion is not in order.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to appeal the Speaker's ruling, with all due respect.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is: Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the House?</chair>
  <chair> The question is on the motion to table.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400642" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to offer this motion to recommit to strengthen the bill before us, <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill>, and the national service laws to ensure that we are all doing what we can to protect those individuals being served by these programs and by the Federal investment in national service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sparked by a 2005 Inspector General report that found rampant, and I recognize and emphasize that word "rampant," noncompliance with individual grant provisions requiring background checks, the Corporation for National Community Service recently completed a rulemaking process to institute background checks for any individuals seeking a federally funded national service position within the Senior Companion and the Foster Grandparent program and from the  AmeriCorps  positions in which individuals have access to a vulnerable population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The regs also prohibited individuals from serving in these positions if they were registered sex offenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I applaud the administration for taking these steps to protect vulnerable populations being served by the national service programs. But I believe that we should go further and provide more protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, this motion to recommit would codify the corporation's regulations, ensuring that these protections are not subject to the whims of future administrations. Despite current efforts, program audits conducted by the Office of the Inspector General have detected a disturbing pattern of noncompliance with criminal background check provision requirements. In some cases, programs have failed to conduct checks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as disturbing, however, other programs have failed to retain the documentation providing this background check information that was conducted for members working with youth and other vulnerable persons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, this motion to recommit would expand on the corporation's efforts by including, and I emphasize that, including all federally funded national service provision positions, not just those within the foster grandparents and senior competitive programs or just those AmeriCorps programs dealing with specific populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. Speaker, in addition to prohibiting registered sex offenders from serving in these positions, this motion to recommit would include those individuals convicted of murder as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our message is clear with this motion to recommit: if you are a program receiving assistance under these national service laws and are accepting participants to serve in federally funded programs and positions within your program, we expect you to screen those potential participants to ensure that they are not, and I emphasize again, not registered sex offenders or convicted murderers. And if you wish to serve in federally funded national service positions, some of which include  as their reward an education award that exceeds that which is received by low-income students through the form of a Pell Grant, you are not welcome if you have committed these crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, some people would ask, Why do we include these crimes? We believe that these crimes are so egregious that they demand Federal action. But also we hope that by requiring criminal history background checks, programs will have increased information with which they can exercise good judgment. It only seems to make sense. To repeat myself, we also hope that by requiring criminal background checks, programs will have the increased information from which they can exercise good judgment  in deciding who deserves the rewards that come with federally funded national service positions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit, which would provide the Education and Labor Committee further time to deliberate on this important topic. This motion expresses a loud and clear message that the House of Representatives believes that those in need who are served by programs supported with assistance under these laws should be assured that they will not be placed in harm's way when approaching these programs for help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to the motion.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>As I understand the motion, Mr. Speaker, it is to codify the regulations that were finalized in November of last year that the Department has proposed for background checks and protection of the programs; is that correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400642" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman will yield, that is one aspect of the motion. It goes farther than that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I think we agree with you, and I would ask if the gentleman would accept a unanimous consent request to change "promptly" to "forthwith" so we could vote on it now and report the bill out.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400642" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I recently sat and listened to the debate on the prior attempt to bring a motion to recommit on a significant issue, that being the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. If the gentleman would amend his unanimous consent request to include that so we might have a vote, I would be happy to.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reclaim my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to say that this is unfortunate, because this is an amendment that we would agree to. It embodies the regulations supported by the Bush administration. It affects a program that has huge bipartisan support in all of our communities, that the President is in support of and is looking for the opportunity to sign this bill. But the gentleman insists upon making his motion in the form of "promptly," so that the bill has to go back to committee, which makes everything much more complicated  in terms of the passage of this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400642" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from New York.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400642" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that the appropriations for these particular programs don't expire for another several months.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>I reclaim my time and would just say that this amendment was never offered in committee, it was never taken to the Rules Committee. This is sort of a "gotcha." But, unfortunately, it dramatically impacts the timetable for this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Pursuant to section 2 of House Resolution 1015, further proceedings on the bill will be postponed.</chair>
