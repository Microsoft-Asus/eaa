  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO BENJAMIN HOOKS -- (Senate - November 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13721">S13721</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412248" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor an exceptional Tennessean and a pioneer in the civil rights movement. Benjamin Hooks was born in Memphis, TN, in 1925, the fifth of seven children by Robert and Bessie Hooks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He grew up in a loving family who taught him to succeed in both education and life. After high school, Dr. Hooks began his higher education by taking pre-law classes at LeMoyne College in Memphis. Prior to finishing his degree, he was drafted into the Army, honorably serving our country in World War II. When he returned home, he went to graduate school at Howard University and afterwards received a law degree from DePaul University in Chicago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Dr. Hooks went through life and excelled in various endeavors, there was one experience that greatly molded the future direction of his life: being born into and growing up in the scourge of racial segregation. After Dr. Hooks graduated college, he returned home and vowed to do his part to end racial segregation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Initially, he fought the fight by becoming one of the first African-American lawyers in Tennessee. It was during this time he met and married Ms. Frances Dancy. Frances was a school teacher and guidance counselor. Eventually, her career took a different path, and she became her husband's assistant, adviser, and traveling companion. They had one daughter together, Patricia Hooks Gray.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Dr. Hooks continued to practice law, he was called to fight for civil rights from another forum, the ministry. In 1956, he was ordained a Baptist minister and began to preach regularly at the Middle Baptist Church in Memphis, TN. It was there he joined Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference and became a pioneer in the NAACP-sponsored restaurant sit-ins and other boycotts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through these efforts, he became a respected voice in the community and in the State. In 1965, Gov. Frank Clement appointed him to become the first African-American criminal court judge in Tennessee history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His efforts as a preacher, judge, and civil rights pioneer eventually led Hooks to Washington, DC, to become the first African-American appointee to the Federal Communications Commission. There he continued the civil rights fight by addressing numerous minority representation issues in the communications industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1976, he was elected as the executive director of the NAACP, where he led that organization for more than 15 years. As a director, he helped to increase membership and fundraising efforts, as well as plan for the organization's future for 17 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also broadened the scope of the NAACP by exploring national issues such as energy, the environment, the criminal justice system, welfare, and national health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his work as a civil rights advocate, he has received numerous awards, including the Humanitarian Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews, and the Freedom Award from the National Civil Rights Museum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Memphis created the Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change, honoring Benjamin Hooks. The Hooks Institute works to advance understanding of the civil rights movement through teaching, research, and community programs and put an emphasis on social movements, race relations, strong communities, public education, effective public participation, and social and economic justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday, I am pleased that Dr. Hooks will receive one more honor, one of the highest civilian awards: the Presidential Medal of Freedom. This medal is given to individuals who have  made an especially meritorious contribution to society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Hooks is a living example of that type of person. His life is an example that even while facing adversity through hard work, you can accomplish revolutionary change. His legacy will not only continue in our State but also throughout our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is only fitting that through this award he once again joins the ranks of other civil rights pioneers such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Clarence M. Mitchell, Leon Howard Sullivan, and Roy Wilkins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an honor and a privilege to serve in the Senate on behalf of Tennesseans such as Dr. Hooks, who have exemplified the great courage that has not only positively affected our State but our country as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
