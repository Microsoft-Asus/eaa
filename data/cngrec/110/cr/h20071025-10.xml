    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it seems like we have a fact and fiction problem that is taking place right here in the body of the House. It is about SCHIP 2.0 that is coming before us today. Well, here are the facts. SCHIP 2.0 will not prevent illegal immigrants from receiving children's health care benefits. It will not prevent adults from receiving children's health care funding, and it will not prevent the government from crowding out 2 million people from the private health care market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill actually covers 400,000 fewer children than SCHIP 1, and it spends 500 million, yes, a half billion dollars more and still leaves out 800,000 eligible children. Yet under SCHIP 2, adults will constitute 10 percent of all SCHIP enrollees in fiscal year 2012 when the program has a major funding problem. Under SCHIP 2.0, 2 million people would lose their health care coverage, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's get straight on the facts. Let's vote against SCHIP 2.0 and make certain we put the children of the working poor first.</paragraph>
