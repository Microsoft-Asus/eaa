    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (<bill type="hc" number="217">H. Con. Res. 217</bill>) to correct technical errors in the enrollment of the bill <bill type="h" number="3580">H.R. 3580</bill>.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.</narrative>
  <narrative>The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hc" number="217">H. Con. Res. 217</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative> Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That, in the enrollment of the bill <bill type="h" number="3580">H.R. 3580</bill>, the Clerk of the House shall make the following corrections:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) In subparagraph (I) of section 402(j)(3) of the Public Health Service Act, as inserted by section 801(a)(2) of the bill:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) In clause (i) of such subparagraph (I), strike "drugs described in subparagraph (C)" and insert "drugs and devices described in subparagraph (C)".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) In clause (iii) of such subparagraph (I), strike "drugs described in subparagraph (C)" and insert "drugs and devices described in subparagraph (C)".</narrative>
  <narrative> (2) In subparagraph (A) of section 505(q)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as added by section 914(a) of the bill, add at the end the following:&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>"Consideration of the petition shall be separate and apart from review and approval of any application.".&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) and the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Terry) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, once again I would ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this resolution concerns two errors in the bill, <bill type="h" number="3580">H.R. 3580</bill>, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments of 2007. The bill has passed both the House and Senate and is currently in the process of being enrolled for delivery to the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution directs the Clerk of the House to correct two errors, both of which were made in drafting and inadvertently occurred as we all worked under pressure to complete the drafting of <bill type="h" number="3580">H.R. 3580</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were under pressure to complete that bill, as you know, before the expiration date on September 30 of PDUFA, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. The failure to reauthorize PDUFA in time would have caused the Food and Drug Administration to send out notice of employee layoffs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm aware of no objection to passage of the resolution, and I would urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3580">H.R. 3580</bill>, which passed the House last week, was highly technical and addressed a number of very complicated FDA policy and regulatory matters. I commend the bipartisan Members and the staff who worked so hard on the language that passed with such broad support in the House. Inevitably, when these complicated matters are addressed, some drafting and technical issues need to be revisited in a technical corrections bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the case of the FDA Amendments of 2007, we were especially mindful that the funding had to be secured to prevent the layoff of FDA reviewers prior to September 30. Given the importance of that deadline to protecting the public health, it is inevitable drafting and workability issues may need to be revisited. The resolution simply corrects two omissions from the text that was approved last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, once again I would urge passage of this corrections legislation. I have no further requests for time and yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, <bill type="hc" number="217">H. Con. Res. 217</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
