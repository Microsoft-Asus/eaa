  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize the passing of Carole Hillard, former Lieutenant Governor of South Dakota. Carole Hillard was a gracious woman with an authentic and deeply held passion for public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Hillard was born August 14, 1936, in Deadwood, SD. She attended the University of Arizona and received a degree in education in 1957. She received a master's degree in education from South Dakota State University in 1982 and a master's degree in political science from the University of South Dakota in 1984.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the mother of five children, David, Sue Ellen, Todd, Eddie, and Lornell, she possessed the practical knowledge to connect with the needs of South Dakotans as she served on the South Dakota Board of Charities and Corrections, the Rapid City United Way Campaign, the South Dakota Children's Home Society, and as the first woman president of the Rapid City Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was elected to the South Dakota House of Representatives in 1991 and served until 1994, at which point she became the first female Lieutenant Governor in South Dakota. From 1995 until 2003, Ms. Hillard graciously presided over the Senate and memorably seemed initially surprised when State Senators on the Senate floor formally referred to her as "Madam President." Her career in public service and the impact she had did not go unnoticed, as she won many awards in her lifetime, including the  1987 Public Service Award, the 1988 Governor's Outstanding Citizen Award, the 1993 South Dakota Outstanding Women Award, and induction into the South Dakota Hall of Fame in 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only has she accomplished much for the State of South Dakota but she has also accomplished much on the international level. In recent years, Carole Hillard was an international consultant traveling on behalf of the U.S. Department of State. Ms. Hillard completed assignments to 67 countries such as Panama, the Czech Republic, San Salvador, Bosnia, and Africa. Recently, she also helped bring to life a skill-building workshop for residents of Kabul, Afghanistan, and supervised the January 2007  elections in the West Bank.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Carole Hillard's life accomplishments are truly remarkable. Her positive outlook on life, her integrity, and her warm personality truly embodied a woman whose passion was the betterment of humankind. While Ms. Hillard is no longer with us, her legacy of service to the people of South Dakota and her diligent work on the promotion of democracy and economic development will not be forgotten.</paragraph>
