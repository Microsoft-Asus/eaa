FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress finds that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) violent crime and drug trafficking are pervasive problems at the national, State, and local level;</narrative>
  <narrative> (2) according to recent Federal Bureau of Investigation, Uniform Crime Reports, violent crime in the United States is on the rise, with a 2.3 percent increase in violent crime in 2005 (the largest increase in the United States in 15 years) and an even larger 3.7 percent jump during the first 6 months of 2006, and the Police Executive Research Forum reports that, among jurisdictions providing information, homicides are up 10.21 percent, robberies are up 12.27 percent, and aggravated assaults  with firearms are up 9.98 percent since 2004;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) these disturbing rises in violent crime are attributable in part to the spread of criminal street gangs and the willingness of gang members to commit acts of violence and drug trafficking offenses;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) according to a recent National Drug Threat Assessment, criminal street gangs are responsible for much of the retail distribution of the cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and other illegal drugs being distributed in rural and urban communities throughout the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) gangs commit acts of violence or drug offenses for numerous motives, such as membership in or loyalty to the gang, for protecting gang territory, and for profit;</narrative>
  <narrative> (6) gang presence and intimidation, and the organized and repetitive nature of the crimes that gangs and gang members commit, has a pernicious effect on the free flow of interstate commercial activities and directly affects the freedom and security of communities plagued by gang activity, diminishing the value of property, inhibiting the desire of national and multinational corporations to transact business in those communities, and in a variety of ways directly and substantially affecting interstate  and foreign commerce;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) gangs often recruit and utilize minors to engage in acts of violence and other serious offenses out of a belief that the criminal justice systems are more lenient on juvenile offenders;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) gangs often intimidate and threaten witnesses to prevent successful prosecutions;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) gangs prey upon and incorporate minors into their ranks, exploiting the fact that adolescents have immature decision-making capacity, therefore, gang activity and recruitment can be reduced and deterred through increased vigilance, appropriate criminal penalties, partnerships between Federal and State and local law enforcement, and proactive prevention and intervention efforts, particularly targeted at juveniles and young adults, prior to and even during gang involvement;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) State and local prosecutors and law enforcement officers, in hearings before the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and elsewhere, have enlisted the help of Congress in the prevention, investigation, and prosecution of gang crimes and in the protection of witnesses and victims of gang crimes; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) because State and local prosecutors and law enforcement have the expertise, experience, and connection to the community that is needed to assist in combating gang violence, consultation and coordination between Federal, State, and local law enforcement and collaboration with other community agencies is critical to the successful prosecutions of criminal street gangs and reduction of gang problems.</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the Senate considers The Gang Abatement and Prevention Act of 2007, a bill concerned with the Nation's growing gang problem. I want to thank Senator Feinstein for her tireless work on this issue over many years and, in particular, for working diligently with me to address my concerns and to formulate what I hope we all agree is an even better gang bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Violent crime in America is again on the rise. This troubling news is in my view at least in part the result of the Bush administration's failure to heed the lessons learned from our successful fight against violent crime in the 1990s. Congress and the Clinton administration provided significant new funding to strengthen State and local law enforcement and supported programs to prevent gang and youth violence. Our efforts worked. Studies have repeatedly shown that, violent crime and gang offenses  steadily dropped to historic lows. But the Bush administration chose a different course, and, despite warnings from me and others, has repeatedly cut funding for State and local cops on the beat and community programs targeting the prevention of youth crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that this bill will be part of a return to productive law enforcement strategies that worked so well in the past. I share the views expressed at the hearing in June by Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton that "we can't arrest our way out of our gang crime problem." As those who have worked on this issue for years know all too well, we must match our commitment to law enforcement with an equal commitment to intervention and prevention as a means of curbing gang violence. Neither  strategy works without the other, and I believe, as so many law enforcement and civil leaders do, that any legislative proposal to address gang violence must focus on new means to prevent youth and gang violence. I am glad that Senator Feinstein's bill now reflects these priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Gang Abatement and Prevention Act of 2007 represents a significant improvement over earlier gang legislation. It does not contain the death penalties, mandatory minimums, and expansive juvenile transfer provisions that were among my strongest objections to some past proposals. Further, Senator Feinstein has worked with me and others to ensure that this bill will provide some of the resources necessary to reverse the policies of this administration, which have neglected the officers  who combat gang violence on a daily basis and the organizations that work to keep children out of gangs. I particularly appreciate provisions in the bill to provide up to $1 billion over 10 years to support collaborative law enforcement and community prevention efforts, with a significant portion of that amount going to civic groups for innovative prevention programs that truly work to reduce gang violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have long said that I don't believe that sweeping new Federal crimes, which federalize the kind of street crime that States have traditionally addressed and can handle with the right resources and assistance, are the right way to go. The bill still contains more emphasis on federalizing crime and mandating sentences than I would like. But I have tried to work with Senator Feinstein to reduce its impact on the sphere of criminal law traditionally handled by the States and to focus on  the most serious offenders and conduct, for which Federal attention is needed. I also appreciate Senator Feinstein and Senator Schumer working with Senator Whitehouse and me to ensure that small States such as Rhode Island and Vermont could be eligible under the bill to receive crucially important witness protection grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all care deeply about eradicating gang violence, and we must work together to create a comprehensive solution to this troubling, persistent problem. I hope that this bill will be a step toward reversing the mistakes of the Bush administration and reinvigorating our efforts to provide Federal support for those who combat gang violence every day and to protect those who are its victims.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="TITLE IV--CRIME PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION STRATEGIES">
    <paragraph>I rise today to congratulate my fellow Senators on the passage of the Gang Abatement and Prevention Act of 2007. This vital legislation makes important changes to the federal criminal code which will allow a more effective response to the ever growing threat that violent street gangs present to our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans are acutely aware of the myriad problems brought about by the influence and prevalence of criminal gangs in this country. I have long shared this concern, and introduced legislation over 10 years ago that attempted to address the problem. Senator Feinstein joined me in that effort, and since that time has pursued this matter with a vigor and tenacity that should make the residents of California proud. I want to offer my heartfelt congratulations and appreciation to Senator</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that all members of the Senate share their constituents' desire to see a diminished role of gangs and associated violence in our communities. The question is very simple: How do we achieve this goal?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The prevailing thought is to either modify the criminal code or provide financial assistance that enhances procedures and programs that have been proven to effectively reduce gang participation. The bill that passed today does both of these things, and it is my hope that the vital tools in this initiative can be utilized by state and local personnel to provide for a greatly diminished threat from criminal street gangs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing I want to make perfectly clear is that my involvement with this issue does not diminish my concerns with the federalization of crimes. I want to read a few sentences I said on the Senate Floor in 1996 when introducing the Federal Gang Violence Act of 1996: "Our problem is severe. Moreover, there is a significant role the Federal Government can play in fighting this battle. I am not one to advocate the unbridled extension of Federal jurisdiction. Indeed, I often think that we have federalized  too many crimes. However, in the case of criminal street gangs, which increasingly are moving interstate to commit crimes, there is a very proper role for the Federal Government to play."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said this in 1996, and my thoughts have not changed. The federal government too many times hands out money like a broken ATM, subsidizing projects that are more appropriately left to the states. However, the fact that Gangs have operations which spread throughout our country necessitates a federal law enforcement response. I am confident that Americans would approve of their tax dollars being effectively utilized in attempts to reduce gangs and criminal activity, and provide a safer environment  for their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The young people who join criminal gangs have made an unfortunate choice to squander all of the opportunities available in their life, opportunities which are abundant in our great nation. But even worse, their choice to participate in violent gang crimes put the lives of innocent Americans in danger. The same innocent people who have rightly chosen to live their life in a productive manner benefiting fellow citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Numerous cities in my home state of Utah, such as Orem, St. George, and Provo are facing an increase in gang activity. National gangs, like MS-13, are expanding their presence in Utah. Law enforcement is also reporting an increase in gang members relocating from areas of Southern California. It is vital that we provide immediate assistance to cities that are in the beginning stages of a battle with highly sophisticated national gangs. If a city can't deal with this problem swiftly and severely,  then the gangs will fester like a disease, amplifying to an unmanageable level. We have seen this throughout the country, and I am dedicated to ensure that the cities in Utah and other states receive appropriate and necessary assistance from Congress to increase community prevention efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the efforts of lawmakers whose tireless efforts produced this bill, and am hopeful that the funds provided for prevention and mentoring can be utilized to help negate the persistent efforts of gangs to augment their ranks with additional kids. Life provides many choices, and I hope that our youth will find the strength and courage to resist the gang lifestyle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize that there is no mechanism which can easily remove the scourge of criminal gangs, but am confident that this bill will provide resources which can enhance and amplify the efforts of dedicated personnel who endeavor to bestow positive influence to our communities.</paragraph>
