    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me first commend my distinguished friend and colleague, also a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the gentleman from New York, Mr. ELIOT ENGEL, chairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, for introducing this important resolution, which welcomes an impressive delegation of Presidents, Prime Ministers, and Foreign Ministers from the Caribbean to Washington, DC for the Conference on the Caribbean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Caribbean nations are as varied and stunningly exquisite as anywhere in the world. We are pleased to have a strong relationship with the Caribbean Community, also known as CARICOM, the free trade association that unifies these states.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the first time in its history, through the coordination of the Caribbean Community, the State Department and Congress, the Conference of the Caribbean is convening in Washington. The Foreign Affairs Committee is pleased to be meeting with the members of this delegation when they convene here on June 19 through June 21. They will also be meeting with President Bush as well as members of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Congressional Black Caucus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is to be a historic meeting that ushers in a new era of cooperation between the United States and the nations of the Caribbean, an area of the world often neglected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States and the countries of the Caribbean can enhance collaboration in several important areas, including mutually beneficial trade and economic relationships; battling crime, drugs, and terrorism; and combating the spread of diseases including HIV/AIDS. This will also be a golden opportunity for the Caribbean nations and the United States to cooperate on new and clean energy production technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our relations with the Caribbean also hit very close to home as there are increasing numbers of Americans of Caribbean heritage making significant contributions to our culture here in America. I need only to cite a few that come to mind, and one of the gentlemen I had the privilege of meeting years ago was none other that Mr. Harry Belafonte, whose roots are also from the Caribbean. What about the late and former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman to run for President  of the United States, and she certainly distinguished herself in representing her constituents from New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Also, at the meeting, I had the privilege of meeting with a gentleman by the name of Sidney Poitier from the Caribbean, of Caribbean heritage. And of course none other than former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and also former Secretary of State, Mr. Colin Powell, whose heritage is also from the Caribbean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to continue to work on ways to strengthen the open markets and economic ties that have brought prosperity to many Caribbean nations that promise to lift up those in need. We all look forward to seeing some real tangible results coming out of this upcoming conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to give this resolution its fullest support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="418">H. Res. 418</bill> that welcomes the delegations of presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers from the Caribbean to Washington to meet with the U.S. Congress. This delegation brings the President of Suriname, the prime ministers of Barbados, Belize, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago, foreign ministers from the CARICOM countries, and the Assistant Secretary General of the Caribbean Community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These unprecedented meetings are part of the CARICOM Conference on the Caribbean that will take place from June 19-21.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Caribbean Community, or CARICOM, was established in 1973 to unify member countries on foreign policies and trade relations with outside states, and to improve the economic conditions of the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourteen member states will be represented at the meeting, which will focus on trade relations with the United States, energy cooperation, and security concerns, including small arms trafficking and counternarcotics efforts, immigration and the reintegration of the Portuguese in the region, and the prevention of HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is always room to improve U.S. relations with our southern neighbors. Other such areas to be addressed during the discussions include encouraging tourism, protecting the environment, addressing energy security and renewable resources, combating the spread of infectious disease, and promoting democracy and good governance. This bill  recognizes the deep and historic ties between the people of the United States and the Caribbean, and it commends the  Caribbean Community for the establishment of the first-ever conference of this kind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud this important step, and look forward to working with CARICOM to improve the overall relations between the U.S. Congress and our Caribbean allies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend and colleague from Arkansas for his support of this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I forgot to mention as part of my commenting on this, the tremendous number of world-renowned athletes also coming from the Caribbean. I can only think of Bob Clemente from Puerto Rico. I know of one other, but I am going to get back to you on them, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time it is my privilege to yield such time as he may need to the chief sponsor and author of this proposed legislation, my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400122" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my good friend from American Samoa, my classmate, we came to Congress together in 1989, for yielding me this time. I would like to thank Chairman Lantos for marking up this resolution, and for the support of many members of the Foreign Affairs Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank my colleagues. This is the first speech I am making on the House floor since the passing of my dear mother, and I want to thank my colleagues for their support and for their strength and caring for me and my family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this resolution welcomes a delegation of presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers from 14 Caribbean nations to Washington, D.C., for the Conference on the Caribbean, which will be held next week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am the chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and I can tell you that the relationship that the United States has with the Caribbean nations is of paramount importance. In fact, in many of the trips that we have gone on, people have said to us they want the United States to be involved. They have a sense, many times, that we have looked elsewhere, and they don't understand why.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think it is important for our subcommittee to be involved, our committee to be involved and for the U.S. Congress to be involved in helping to foster good ties with the Caribbean nations; and of course this resolution lays the groundwork, and the interaction with the delegations from the Caribbean that will be here this week is very, very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Mr. Faleomavaega said, the Caribbean nations are as culturally varied and physically beautiful as anywhere in the world. It is important to expand our strong relationship with the Caribbean Community, also known as CARICOM. This is an historic conference. For the first time in its history, through the coordination of the Caribbean Community, the State Department, the Congress, the Conference on the Caribbean is convening in Washington. I cannot state how important that is and how  significant that is and what kind of important role the United States Congress can play.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to be the chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, and I will do everything in my power to help facilitate relations between the United States, United States Congress and the nations of the Caribbean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Foreign Affairs Committee is pleased to be meeting with the members of this delegation on June 20 at 2:30 p.m., and I encourage all our colleagues, both on our committee and on our subcommittee, and even people that are not on our committee, to attend this meeting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The delegation will also be meeting with President Bush, as well as members of the Ways and Means Committee and the Congressional Black Caucus, and as well as, of course, our Foreign Affairs Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I visited four Caribbean countries in the last 6 months and have learned much from our friends in the south. In Haiti, leaders are very appreciative for the support of the United States and for the recent passage of the HOPE legislation, but want to make sure we coordinate closely with the government on our assistance plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further to the south, leaders of the many small island nations feel neglected by the United States and are looking for closer cooperation on energy, security, crime, education, health and other issues. Countries like China are stepping in and filling the vacuum left by the United States in these small, but strategically important countries. This is our hemisphere, the Western Hemisphere, and we simply must be more engaged. We cannot stand back and think that other countries are not going to move  into the vacuum. You know, we used to go to school when we were kids and learn about the policy of "hands off the Americas," but that's not true anymore. Other countries, like China and like Iran and other places, will step in if we neglect these countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our friends in the Caribbean have offered their support for U.S. efforts to combat global terrorism. With the recent revelation that the suspects from Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana were involved in the plot to blow up JFK Airport in New York City, we need more than ever to work closely with our allies in the Caribbean to defeat terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was just in Trinidad with a delegation. We met with the leader of Trinidad, and he told us in emphatic terms how closely he wanted to work with the United States to combat terrorism. They're willing, they're able, they want to work with us. We just need to show that we want to work with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Terrorism is not just a single region issue, it impacts all areas of the world. When we have friends reaching out to us in our hemisphere as allies on the war on terror, we must closely engage with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am looking forward to this historic meeting that ushers in a new era of cooperation between the United States and the Caribbean, an area of the world to which, again, I don't believe we have been paying adequate attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States and the countries of the Caribbean can enhance collaboration in several important areas, including mutually beneficial trade and economic relationships, battling crime, drugs and terrorism, and combating the spread of diseases, including HIV/AIDS. There is also a golden opportunity for the Caribbean nations and the U.S. to cooperate on new and clean energy production technologies. And, again, when we were in Trinidad, we visited some of those technologies, Trinidad being a major  supplier of natural gas to the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our relations with the Caribbean also are very important as there are large numbers of Americans of Caribbean heritage, as the gentleman from American Samoa pointed out, making significant contributions to our culture in America. I represent the New York City area district. In New York City and in the suburbs, and in my district alone in New York, there are very, very large numbers of Caribbean residents, including Jamaicans, Haitians, Dominicans, and many, many others. The Dominican Republic  is a country that wants to work closely with us, a very important country. Haiti needs our attention. Grenada, where the United States invaded when Ronald Reagan was President, now we seem to be neglecting them. We visited there as well. So these are countries that we need to watch, to work with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman on the other side of the aisle mentioned St. Vincent and the Grenadines. It's just coincidental that the foreign minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, who will be here, went to college with me some 40 years ago in New York City. And we have maintained our friendship through all those years, never knowing that I would eventually go to Congress and he would become the foreign minister of St. Vincent in the Grenadines. And so I hope to work with him on these issues. His name  is Louis Straker. These are important relationships, and we need to continue to foster them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, we must continue to work on ways of strengthening the relationships that have brought prosperity to many Caribbean nations and that promise to lift up those in need. It  is my hope that our friends in the Caribbean can see some real concrete results coming out of this important Caribbean Conference in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just conclude by saying the time for rhetoric is over. It is now time for action and a real enhancement of our relations with the Caribbean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues for their support of this legislation. I thank the chairman. I thank the gentleman from the American Samoa, the gentleman from Arkansas. We all need to work together. This should be bipartisan. This is good for America. We need to strengthen our ties with the Caribbean.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the subcommittee chairman for his hard work. Also, I want to thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Lantos, and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen for bringing this forward along with our staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my colleague and chairman of our Subcommittee of the Western Hemisphere. Not only am I an original cosponsor of this important resolution, but also, as a member of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, it has been my privilege over the years to also visit some of our countries here in the Caribbean area. And as my friend from New York has said, sometimes we neglect these so-called small states.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A couple of weeks ago, I had the privilege of hosting several presidents and prime ministers from the South Pacific, from the Pacific region. Currently, in the United Nations they have what is known as a small states association, which is comprised primarily of states or countries from the Caribbean, and also from the Pacific region. And they number about a little over 42 members in the United Nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The point I wanted to make, Mr. Speaker, is these are sovereign, independent nations, and we are not to look at them as just because they're small, that they are not important as far as our national needs are concerned. We ought to be very sensitive to the needs of small states, no matter where they are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to note with a sense of irony that right in the middle of the Caribbean we have 4 million U.S. citizens living in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. I failed to mention that with my love and passion for the sport of golf, it was my privilege to meet a couple of years ago the great golfer from Puerto Rico, Chi Chi Rodriguez. I stated earlier Sammy Sosa. We have so many names here, Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to share with my colleagues and my good friend from Arkansas, tremendous contributions  of talent coming from the Caribbean region. I don't need to say them in terms of the wealth of talent coming from the Caribbean as far as the sport of baseball is concerned. I just want to share that note with my colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And again, I want to commend my good friend, the chairman of our Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. We look forward to meeting with these presidents and prime ministers coming from the Caribbean region.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a daughter of the Caribbean and the only member of the House from the English-speaking Caribbean, I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="418">H. Res. 418</bill>, which recognizes and welcomes the delegation of Presidents, Prime Ministers, and Foreign Ministers from the Caribbean to Washington, DC, and commends the Caribbean Community, CARICOM, for holding their Conference on the Caribbean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with great pride that I join my colleagues in applauding the heads of Government of the CARICOM Caribbean Community of nations for convening their conference on the Caribbean--A 20/20 Vision--here in Washington. The theme of the conference is: CARICOM DEVELOPMENT IN THE 21st Century: Economic Growth with Social Equity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank and commend my colleague and friend the chairman of the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Representative Engel for introducing <bill type="hr" number="418">H. Res. 418</bill> and for shepherding it on to the floor of the House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the nations of the Caribbean, some of the longest and most stable democracies in the region, have long been among our closest friends and staunchest allies. In recent years, the region was described as America's "third border" because events there have a direct impact on the security of the United States. However, while we have made statements about bolstering political and economic stability in the region, the reality is that our friends to the south have been suffering from our  benign neglect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether it has been our position on Caribbean bananas at the WTO, or our insistence that our Caribbean neighbors make costly upgrades to their air and seaports to comply with our post-September 11th security concerns, to the recently instituted Western Hemisphere Initiative, our Caribbean neighbors have been taking it on the chin economically as a result of policy decisions we have made to address our domestic and foreign policy agendas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also hope that the recently uncovered plot to blow up a fuel supply line at the JFK Airport in NY, allegedly involving four men from Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago will not lead to the belief that the Caribbean is becoming a "hotbed of terrorism".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In holding their conference in Washington, our Caribbean neighbors hope to strengthen the relationship between the United States and CARICOM by addressing priority areas for future Caribbean growth and development, including issues related to trade, competitiveness and investment, in mutually beneficial and reinforcing ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They also hope to deepen and broaden the dialogue between the Governments and people of CARICOM and the Government and people of the United States of America that should result in the renewed appreciation of the Caribbean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We--the Congress and the Bush Administration--owe it to these small and vulnerable friends to seriously consider the issues they will raise with us during the conference. These include, trade and competitiveness, immigration, cooperation on security issues including the return of criminal deportees, disaster preparedness and mitigation and health-care including HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Caribbean and its peoples have deep and historic ties with the United States and its peoples. It is my fervent hope that through this conference and the meetings that will take place with President Bush and the Members of Congress, including the Congressional Black Caucus, that relations between the United States and the Caribbean will continue to grow closer in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support adoption of this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="418">H. Res. 418</bill>, recognizing and welcoming the delegation of Presidents, Prime Ministers, and Foreign Ministers from the Caribbean to Washington, DC, and commending the Caribbean Community, CARICOM, for holding the Conference on the Caribbean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will first begin by thanking my colleague on the Foreign Affairs committee and chairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Representative Eliot Engel, for introducing such an important key resolution, which welcomes to Washington, DC, Presidents, Prime Ministers, and Foreign Ministers from all nations of the Caribbean. Through cooperation between CARICOM, the Department of State and the United States Congress, delegates will meet for the first time in history for a three  day--June 19-June 21, 2007--Conference on the Caribbean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the United States House of Representatives, I recognize the deep and historic ties between our American people and those of the Caribbean. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Caribbean community, CARICOM, for holding this conference, as well as to recognize and welcome all delegates to the United States. I look forward to working with the Caribbean community in maintaining and strengthening the relations between both countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CARICOM was created through the Treaty of Chaguaramas in 1973 to aid in developing stronger trade and economic relations, improving labor relations, and sustaining economic development and overall cooperation when dealing with third-party states. It will be the hope of all delegates convened to usher in a new era of cooperation between the U.S. and the Caribbean; an area of the world that is often neglected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a strong supporter of the notion of a global marketplace of ideas, I strongly believe that this meeting can serve as a landmark toward creating mutually beneficial relationships, as well as enhancing collaboration in several areas such as trade and economic relationships, crimes, drugs and terrorism, while also combating the spread of diseases, including HIV/AIDS. The Conference on the Caribbean also allows the two countries to cooperate on new and clean energy-production technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a leader in one of the most diverse metropolitan districts in the nation, as well as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee here on Capitol Hill, I strongly cherish the bond that our two nations share. I can attest to the significant contributions that Americans of Caribbean heritage are making in America. Houston  is a multicultural city with a large and even advancing international community; for that reason, I strongly support and value a cultural  outreach effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank you once again, Mr. Engel, for your efforts in introducing this piece of legislation. I am looking forward to witnessing the results of this upcoming conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.</paragraph>
