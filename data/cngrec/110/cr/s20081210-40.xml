    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to Ryne Dougherty, a young man from Montclair, NJ, whose young life was tragically cut short on October 15. He suffered a fatal brain hemorrhage while playing football, the sport about which he was so passionate. Although he was only 16 years old, Ryne made a tremendous impact on his teammates, friends, and community. He was a caring and loving young man who displayed a special kindness and a deep commitment to his friends and family. An  honor student and linebacker on the Montclair High School Junior Varsity football team, Ryne also found time to fix computers to benefit underprivileged families. Ryne was admired by all who knew him--over 1,000 mourners gathered together to remember him and comfort each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ryne worked toward his goals with steadfast determination, eager to succeed. His football coach said that Ryne never sought glory or praise; he came to the field every day prepared to work his hardest out of respect for his teammates and love for the game. Family and friends said that Ryne always wanted to talk about football. He was always ready with the latest NFL statistics and greatly enjoyed playing football video games with his friends in his spare time. To honor Ryne, the New York Giants  held a moment of silence during their game on October 19, a fitting tribute for a young fan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ryne was a mentor and an inspiration to his teammates. Many friends sought to follow his example: succeeding in school and working diligently on the field all while keeping a smile on his face. During Ryne's funeral, Rev. Gerald Whitaker asked the mourners to imagine that Ryne had made a game-saving tackle to end a big game against their rival high school. The crowd responded with a thunderous ovation, a fitting way to honor Ryne.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would like express my sympathy to Ryne's family. I hope that they will be comforted by their many positive memories and by the outpouring of support from the Montclair community. His family decided to donate Ryne's organs, yet another way that Ryne has touched the lives of others. I am proud to honor him today.</paragraph>
