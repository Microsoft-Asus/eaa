    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I stand to join my colleagues in the consideration of <bill type="hr" number="984">H. Res. 984</bill> which supports the designation of July 26, 2008, as National Day of the Cowboy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="984">H. Res. 984</bill> was introduced by Representative GABRIELLE GIFFORDS of Arizona on February 13, 2008, and since then, the bill has garnered the support and cosponsorship of 52 Members of Congress, both men and women, from both sides of the aisle. The measure was considered and passed by voice vote out of the Oversight Committee on June 12, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is reasonable to assert that our great country wouldn't be what it is today without the significant influences of the cowboy. This is why each year a day is set aside for Americans to celebrate the contributions of the cowboy and cowgirl to our Nation's culture and heritage. With the advocacy of the National Day of the Cowboy Organization for the past several years, the National Day of the Cowboy has been celebrated by the public through education, the arts, special events, rodeos,  and other community activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, July 26 has been selected as the day for honoring and preserving the rich history of the cowboy settlement in the American West, an act that forever changed the landscape of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona for introducing this thoughtful measure, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in celebrating the American cowboys and cowgirls by agreeing to pass <bill type="hr" number="984">H. Res. 984</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of the resolution designating July 26, 2008, as the National Day of the Cowboy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the last 3 years on the last Saturday of July, people across America gathered to honor one of the greatest icons of our Nation, the American cowboy. National Day of the Cowboy first emerged in July of 2005 in large part to the efforts of the late United States Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cowboys are the original heroes of American culture. From the earliest western settlers to present-day ranchers and cattlemen, their tireless courage, integrity, and adventurous spirit has made them a symbol of values that built this great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their trade nourishes our bodies as well as our souls. The values inspire each of us. From Maine to California, from twisted urban streets to the vast, open plains, Americans envy and respect those who each day, ride off into the sunset.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution and leave you with the words of poet laureate Ron Wilson--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I thank my colleague from South Carolina for supporting this resolution.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412188" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud that today the House is considering <bill type="hr" number="984">H. Res. 984</bill>, a resolution I sponsored that officially designates July 26, 2008, as the "National Day of the Cowboy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Located in beautiful Willcox, Arizona, the National Day of the Cowboy organization works to increase national support for the proclaimed "Cowboy Day," and to publicize news and information about the resolution and campaign, so that active participation in celebration of the National Day of the Cowboy continues to grow each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many thanks to Bethany Braley, executive director and publisher of the National Day of the Cowboy organization, for her tireless vision to remind future generations of the cowboys' contribution to America's rich western heritage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the U.S. Senate has recognized the National Day of the Cowboy in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, <bill type="hr" number="984">H. Res. 984</bill> represents the first time that the U.S. House of Representatives has officially recognized the contribution of the cowboy and cowgirl to America's culture and heritage. I am pleased to be a part of the 4th Annual National Day of the Cowboy designation. On June 20, 2008, the National Day of the Cowboy resolution also passed in the Arizona State Legislature, making Arizona the first State  to pass the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legendary cowboy and cowgirl are embraced and respected by people the world over as symbols of rugged individualism. Each represents a commitment to explore, work hard and seek adventure while demonstrating the personal determination to survive. He/she is loyal to an honorable code of ethics as well as persistent and tenacious in the face of any challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In honor of cowboys and cowgirls worldwide, I encourage Americans to observe the National Day of the Cowboy on Saturday, July 26, 2008, with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, <bill type="hr" number="984">H. Res. 984</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
