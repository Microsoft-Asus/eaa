    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a brave American who is serving our country with distinction. Private First Class Matthew T. Spaulding of Bluffton, South Carolina, was a recent recipient of the Army's Bronze Star with Valor for his heroic actions in Afghanistan. The former Bluffton High School quarterback has been deployed since January as an Army medic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 9th, PFC Spaulding was on patrol with his unit when their vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device. Suffering several wounds himself, Spaulding was able to come to the aid of one of his comrades who was severely injured. Through his quick and selfless action in the face of danger, Spaulding was able to save his fellow soldier's life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bronze Star with Valor is awarded to a soldier who has performed an act of heroism in combat. It is the fourth highest combat medal awarded to members of the armed services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful for PFC Spaulding's service, and for all the brave men and women who are fighting to protect our freedoms around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
