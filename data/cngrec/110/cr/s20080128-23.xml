  <speaking speaker="300006" topic="SERGEANT JON MICHAEL SCHOOLCRAFT, III">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave soldier. SGT Jon Michael Schoolcraft, III, 26 years old, died January 19 in Taji, Iraq. Sergeant Schoolcraft died of injuries he sustained when an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle. With an optimistic future before him, Jon risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jon Schoolcraft, called Mike by his friends, graduated from Wapakoneta High School in Ohio in 2001. Growing up in Ohio with his mother, Cindy Schoolcraft-Hooker, Mike also spent time in Madison, IN, visiting his father, Mike Schoolcraft, Jr. Mike excelled at sports and particularly enjoyed skateboarding. His sense of duty to his country and a desire to see the world drove him to enroll in the Army's Delayed Entry Program while in high school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After serving a first tour in Iraq, Mike reenlisted, telling a friend that he could not imagine doing anything other than being a soldier. In November of last year, Mike married his wife Amber and decided that his next tour in Iraq would be his last so they could begin a family. Mike was assigned to C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division in Schofield Barracks, HI. For his extraordinary service, Mike was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I join Mike's family and friends in mourning his death. While  we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will remember when they think of Mike. Today and always, Mike will be remembered by family members, friends and fellow soldiers as a true American hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made  while dutifully serving his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I search for words to do justice in honoring Mike's sacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: "We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here." This statement is just  as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain that the impact of Mike's actions will live on far longer than any record of these words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my sad duty to enter the name of SGT Jon Michael Schoolcraft, III, in the Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like Mike's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, "He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe  away tears from off all faces."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be with all of you, as I know He is with Mike.</paragraph>
