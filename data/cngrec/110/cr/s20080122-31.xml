  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Union League Club of Chicago and its Boys and Girls Clubs. This month they celebrate an important milestone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Union League Club of Chicago was founded in 1879, adopting the motto "commitment to country and community." Throughout its long and distinguished history, the Union League Club of Chicago has maintained a strong tradition of civic involvement. Over the years, Club members have been a part of politics and society, advocating on issues ranging from election reform to the death penalty. The Union League Club of Chicago also helped develop community support for cultural institutions as they  were coming into the community, including Orchestra Hall, the Field Museum, and the Harold Washington Library Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1920, recognizing a critical need in the community, the Union League Club of Chicago established the Union League Boys Club, a club designed to serve the large population of underprivileged children in Chicago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the club opens the doors of its four Chicago area facilities to disadvantaged youth who are in communities with some Chicago's the lowest educational attainment levels and highest dropout and poverty rates. In addition to providing wholesome social and recreational opportunities, the Union League Boys and Girls Clubs offer a wide variety of structured programs that emphasis character building and empowerment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The clubs provide a safe and inviting refuge for young Chicagoans, free from the negative influences of drugs, gangs, and violence. Studies have shown that afterschool programs, like those offered by the Union League Boys and Girls Clubs, can reduce urban crime rates by keeping teens off the streets and providing positive alternatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At each club, members are served balanced snacks and meals and given nutritional guidance they can use when not at the club. The clubs also provide an environment in which students can tackle their homework, with assistance when they need it and access to personal computers. Not surprisingly, club members average significantly higher grade point averages than their peers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A full-time professional staff, assisted by part-time workers and volunteers, provides high school students with career guidance and job training to help young club members become responsible citizens. Each year, the clubs award scholarships to help members pay for college or trade school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the summer, members take advantage of the 250-acre summer camp owned by the clubs. Located a short distance north of the Illinois-Wisconsin border, the camp gives Chicago youth an opportunity to experience and enjoy the outdoors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This month, the Union League Boys and Girls Clubs realize a remarkable achievement. For the first time in its 87-year history, the Clubs will enroll the 10,000th member in a single program year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I join the Chicago community in commending the Union League Club of Chicago and its Boys and Girls Clubs for outstanding commitment to the welfare of the community and for enriching thousands of young lives--in the past, today, and for decades to come.</paragraph>
