  <speaking speaker="400120" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday Defense Secretary Gates requested 43 billion more dollars for the war in Iraq, 43 billion more dollars to support the President's plan for more of the same. We have spent $400 billion in 4 years on the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 41 days of the cost of the war, 10 million children would get health care. For 1 month for the cost of the war, 7 1/2  million children would get health care. For 1 week of the cost of the war, 2 1/2  million children would get health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While billions have gone unaccounted for in Iraq, and the administration has shown no willingness to do what is necessary to crack down on the waste, fraud and abuse in Iraq, the President calls health care for American children excessive spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President is asking for an open-ended, open-wallet commitment to Iraq; and yet he's told America's children, you're on your own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want you to think about this: there have been three vetoes in President Bush's 7 years; one to redeploy from Iraq, one to permit stem cell research, and one to give 10 million children health care; and it says it all about the President and his priorities.</paragraph>
