    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Carol Girard of Voluntown, Connecticut, is an inspiration to all of us. Last year a devastating fire forced Carol, her husband, Thomas, and family from their home and into a camper in the shadow of the home's charred remains. After that loss, Carol suffered the ultimate tragedy when her husband, Thomas, and their son, Marc, drowned in Connecticut's Green Falls Pond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week the television show Extreme Makeover: Home Edition answered Voluntown's call for help. Today, where her house once stood, a new home, a new life and restored hope have arisen for Carol and her surviving children, Lucas, Hannah, Jacqueline and Adam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hundreds upon hundreds of volunteers have poured on to the site this week making the construction of a new beautiful home possible. In particular, Home Designs by Bruno of Colchester, Connecticut, deserves America's thanks for coordinating this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In honor of the great work of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition and the Girard family, I join all of Eastern Connecticut in saying "Move That Bus!"</paragraph>
