    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of our troops who are still waiting for critical funding needed to fight the war on terror. I want to make sure the American people understand what is happening with legislation that provides money for our soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of passing a clean bill the President could sign into law, the Democrats chose to pass a political statement that ties troop funding to arbitrary withdrawal deadlines, and it's loaded with earmarks. The Democrats have even dragged their feet on their own legislation, taking a 2-week recess without funding our troops and spending another week in Washington bickering over a bill that they know that the President will veto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why are we playing politics with money for our soldiers? Our troops can't win this war with political rhetoric. They need money, they need supplies, and they have been waiting over  70 days since the President made the request. I call on this House to pass a clean bill, get it to the President's desk, so we can give our war fighters the tools that they need to achieve victory.</paragraph>
