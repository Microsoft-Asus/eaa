  <narrative>SUPPORT OUR VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11175]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this Democrat-led Congress has yet to send one spending bill to the President. In particular, they have failed to pass funding for our veterans, and because of their inaction, our veterans are being shortchanged and denied needed resources and benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite widespread support for the Veterans' Affairs spending bill, the majority is refusing to take final action. This delay is jeopardizing our ability to get the necessary funding and resources to those who need it most. The bill includes $4.1 billion for VA hospitals and clinics, $600 million for posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury care, $2.9 billion for mental health and substance abuse treatment for veterans, and $480 million for research into prosthetics for wounded  warriors and amputees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can all agree that our veterans deserve our utmost support, and as a grateful 30-year member of the American Legion, it is time for Democrats to work with Republicans for our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
