  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, failure of Congress to reauthorize the Secure Schools and Community Self-Determination Act amounts to a breach of faith to more than 600 forested counties and 4,400 school districts across America. To Baker County, Oregon, this breach of faith means the road department crew who plow snow 5 months out of the year will be cut in half. The county will also have to fire the only trainer who prepares volunteer firefighters in 13 rural communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this Congress fails to act, the 11 people left in the road department will be responsible for maintaining 1,100 miles of road; that is one person for every 100 miles of road, the same distance from here to Richmond, Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this Congress fails to act, volunteer firefighters might not receive the vital life-saving training on equipment, tactics and communications. County Judge Fred Warner says, Because we have vast Federal lands, we have no tax base to replace the lost funding. We just need the Federal Government to honor its commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues, Congress must renew the Federal Government's promise to timbered communities. Pass <bill type="h" number="17">H.R. 17</bill>. Time is running out.</paragraph>
