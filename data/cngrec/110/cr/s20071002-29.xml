  <narrative>SPECIAL OLYMPICS -- (Senate - October 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12430">S12430</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, over the next 10 days, a remarkable event will unfold in Shanghai, China. Every 2 years, thousands of Special Olympics athletes from around the world come together to showcase their athletic skills and celebrate the spirit of Special Olympics. Starting today, more than 7,500 Special Olympians will begin competing in Shanghai in the 2007 Special Olympics World Summer Games.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the coming 10 days, tens of thousands of athletes, coaches, volunteers, family members, government and industry officials, plus experts in health and education from 165 countries have come together to celebrate the talents of those among us who have intellectual disabilities. This spectacular event is not about athletic skill as much as it is about determination, courage, and the desire to compete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can speak firsthand about what a rewarding experience it is for all of us who have been involved in Special Olympics. Last year, my State of Iowa hosted the first USA National Summer Games. Thousands of athletes, volunteers, coaches, and families attended our games, in addition to 30,000 fans and spectators. Ames, IA, was transformed into an Olympic Village, and it was thrilling to experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that three extraordinary athletes from Iowa are now in China competing: Corey Leonhard in track, and Jenna Schrack and Jody Sheriff competing in bowling. Team USA includes 401 athletes, and 102 of them are at the World Games today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Special Olympics is not just about sports. It is about spirit, and it is about drawing out the best in all of us. The Special Olympics organization is responsible for much more than the games. Its Special Olympics Healthy Athletes Program, developed over a decade ago, focuses on the health, fitness, and well-being of people with and without disabilities. Last year alone, it made possible more than 135,000 health care screenings. Volunteer health care professionals and students were trained to  provide the screening and compile the data. In China, medical volunteers will provide health examinations free of charge, including dental, vision, and hearing exams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Special Olympics is both a world-class sporting event and a world-class humanitarian experience. Many countries have sent delegations to the games. In addition to our athletes and volunteers attending the Opening Ceremonies, the U.S. delegation will include Department of Education Secretary Margaret Spellings, figure skating champion Michelle Kwan, former Assistant Secretary of Education John Hager, Ernie Banks of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, Lynn Fuchs, Professor of Special Education  and Human Development at Vanderbilt University, Anne Sweeney of Disney Media Networks and Disney-ABC Television Group, Jennifer Polk Wardlow, a Special Olympics North Carolina athlete, Dr. Tim Shriver, chairman of the board of Special Olympics, and the incomparable Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founder of Special Olympics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I regret that, with the Senate in session, I couldn't attend today's opening ceremonies. But my  thoughts are with each and every one of Special Olympics athletes. I wish them all the very best.</paragraph>
