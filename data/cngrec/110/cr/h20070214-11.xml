    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday, while we were here at work, his family, my prior coworkers at the Department of Health, my friends and community said farewell to a beloved son, Albert Bryan, Sr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His sudden passing caught us all off guard, but that was often his way. Never one to call attention to himself, despite his good looks, tall stature and significant presence, he was unassuming and gentle, with a generous spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether it was as a senior officer at one of our banks or as PTA president at the Pearl B. Larsen Elementary School our children attended, or whether it was as an administrator of the Charles Howard Health Facility or co-owner of a favorite watering hole, or whether it was as the devoted son, husband, father, grandfather who was always about family, he was the best there was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born and raised in St. Thomas, but living much of his adult life on St. Croix, he accomplished the impossible in bringing the two islands together, especially through the camaraderie of the Cruzan Gentlemen of his current home and the Gentlemen of Savaan, where he spent his early life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bert was my coworker, supporter, confidant and friend. I will miss him, as all who knew him and loved him will. He gave a lot to everyone that he touched as he passed this way. We are grateful for his life, a life he lived fully and well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My family, staff and the Congress of the United States extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, children, grandchildren and his entire family. May he rest in peace.</paragraph>
