    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I would like to honor a special group of south Florida high school students for being selected to participate in a prestigious debate competition this weekend in New York City.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The students, Zoe Friedland, Samuel Natale, Alexandre Pouille, Jemma Hinkly, Emily Deyes, Christopher Bahls-Mariles, and Rachael Mielke, hail from Dreyfoos High School in Palm Beach County, and will represent the school at the National Public Policy Forum debate championship this weekend</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish these students the best of luck. They are some of the best and brightest, and I know they will represent south Florida well. I commend them for their hard work, dedication and perseverance that got them to this level and qualified them for this competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to take this opportunity to express the condolences from my district to the family and friends of the Virginia Tech students who were tragically killed on Monday, and wish a speedy recovery to those who were injured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our children are the future of our Nation and our greatest asset. I join my colleagues in the House of Representatives to express our grief and sympathy. Our thoughts and prayers are with their friends and families.</paragraph>
