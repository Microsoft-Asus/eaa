    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to announce for the information of the Senate and the public that the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs will hold a hearing entitled, "United Nations Development Program in North Korea: A Case Study." In early 2007, reports surfaced of significant management failures in the operations of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in North  Korea. Several months later, the UNDP took the unprecedented step of suspending its North Korean operations. The Subcommittee's hearing will examine UNDP operations in North Korea, reviewing such issues as inappropriate staffing, inadequate administrative and fiscal controls, inaccessible audits and insufficient whistleblower</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Subcommittee hearing is scheduled for Thursday, January 24, 2008, at 10 a.m., in Room 342 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. For further information, please contact Elise Bean of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at 224-9505.</paragraph>
