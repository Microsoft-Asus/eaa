  <narrative>CITY OF SHAME: BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H561]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Berkeley, California, has fallen off the deep end, and it wasn't caused by an earthquake either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The city council passed a resolution telling the local United States Marine Corps recruiting station that it was "not welcome in the city, and if recruiters choose to stay, they do so as uninvited and unwelcome intruders."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mayor Tom Bates said, "The Marines don't belong here, they shouldn't have come here, and they should leave."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shame on Mayor Bates. He has flippantly and pompously denounced those noble few--the proud--the chosen--the Marines that represent everything that is good and right about America. These defenders of democracy deserve better than Berkeley's arrogant disapproval.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These deplorable anti-Marine city council members must still have a sixties peacenik, hippie mentality that world peace can occur by sitting around smoking dope and banging on the tambourine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Berkeley should lose all Federal funding for their smug denouncement of the Marine Corps. Patriotic Americans should not subsidize cities that tell the Marines to "get out of town."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as for the Marines, we'll take them all in Texas. We'll have a parade, fly the flag, and sing the Marine Hymn. So Semper Fi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
