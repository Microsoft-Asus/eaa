    <paragraph>Mr. President, the plague of gun violence is one that affects our society on many levels. Across the country people are calling out for a change in our Nation's gun policies. A recent article, The Battle Over Illegal Guns, in the June issue of Ladies' Home Journal Magazine, is a case in point. This article detailed the tragic death of Wake County, NC sheriff's department investigator Mark Tucker, and provided yet another example of a pervasive problem in our country that has not yet  been addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 12, 2004, Mark Tucker returned home from work to eat lunch. As he left his house to return to work, he noticed an unfamiliar car with an open trunk parked in a field near his home. He drove over to investigate it. As he stepped out of his unmarked patrol car, an 18-year-old young man pulled a gun out of the trunk of the unfamiliar car. The teenager, who was on probation for breaking into cars, stated he had only intended to engage in a little target practice that day. However, because  he was on probation, he was not legally allowed to possess a firearm. When he saw Mark's badge he panicked, killing Mark with a single shot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because the teenager had a felony record, he was not legally permitted to purchase a gun himself. In order to circumvent this, he simply had a friend fill out the required Federal paperwork for him at the gun dealer. This type of transaction, when one customer stands in for another who is not legally able to purchase a weapon, is known as a straw purchase. According to a 2000 report by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, ATF, straw purchases are the most common source of  crime guns. Approximately half of the 1,530 trafficking investigations examined in the report involved stand-in buyers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though Federal law enforcement officials have increasingly teamed up with local officials over the past few years to increase prosecution of firearm-related crimes, not enough attention is being focused on the source of the problem. According to the ATF, nearly 60 percent of the guns used in crimes can be traced to just over 1 percent of this Nation's licensed gun dealers. Five out of six of these guns are obtained illegally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This article not only detailed the tragic events which occurred in Wake County, it illustrated a problem that plagues our society. Negligent dealers and straw purchasers indirectly threaten the security of our communities by facilitating the transfer of dangerous firearms to potential criminals who may use them in violent crimes. We must do more to help our Federal, State and local law enforcement officials keep guns out of the hands of those who shouldn't have them. Simply put, Congress needs  to take up and pass sensible gun legislation.</paragraph>
