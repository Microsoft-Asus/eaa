    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor the 25th anniversary of the Saint Photios National Shrine, the only Greek Orthodox National Shrine in the country, located in Saint Augustine, FL.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As early as 1768 and under the leadership of Dr. Andrew Turnbull, Greek immigrants traveled to America to seek a better life in Florida. Many of these early Greek Americans migrated to Saint Augustine, where, over time, a strong Greek community has formed. Greek immigrants found refuge there as many gathered for solace, fellowship, and worship at the historic Averos House built in 1749 on Saint George Street. The Averos House was purchased by the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese in 1965, and in 1982,  was opened as a National Greek Orthodox Shrine named after Saint Photios the Great, Patriarch of Constantinople.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Saint Photios Greek Orthodox National Shrine gives honor to the memory of the first colony of Greeks in the Americas and the succeeding generations of Greek immigrants; it now serves as a connection and pilgrimage point for Greek Americans and the Greek Orthodox Church in America. It also serves to preserve, enhance, and promote the ethnic and cultural traditions of Greek heritage and the teachings of the Greek Orthodox Church in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Shrine continues to be faithful in maintaining and perpetuating the Greek Orthodox faith and Hellenic Heritage through its programs and activities to all who pass through its historic doors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, February 4, 2007, will mark the 25th anniversary of the Saint Photios Greek Orthodox National Shrine, and I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the purposeful commitment and achievements of this religious and historical institution.</paragraph>
