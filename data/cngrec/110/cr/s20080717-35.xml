    <paragraph>Mr. President, I welcome the women of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., to Capitol Hill in celebration of its centennial anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. is our Nation's first African-American sorority, and was founded on January 15, 1908. Since then, the sorority has always exemplified its motto of "being of service to all mankind."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the course of ten decades, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., has grown its membership to include over 200,000 members throughout the United States, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Caribbean. Through the years, the sorority has remained committed to improving the lives of countless Americans through its involvement in programs including the Mississippi Health Project, the Job Corps, and the African Village Development Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of Nevada alone, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.'s Theta Theta Omega Chapter has provided over $100,000 in scholarships to deserving African-American female Clark County high school students, while its Kappa Xi Chapter has a distinguished record of service both on the University of Nevada Las Vegas campus and throughout the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the coming century, I am certain that this illustrious organization will continue to empower communities and respond to the increasingly complex issues facing the world. I commend the women of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., for their 100 years of distinguished service to our great Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this year we are celebrating Alpha Kappa Alpha, Inc. sorority's 100th birthday. This week, more than 20,000 members from all over the country have come to Washington, DC, to participate in a week-long program of forums and seminars with a focus on leadership, sisterhood and service, known as the Centennial Boul&#xE9;. The theme of this week's celebration is the "Centennial Commitment to Leadership."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The week's events will culminate in today's Unity March where members from the nine African-American Greek fraternities and sororities marched to the Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AKA's International President, Barbara McKinzie, who has lived in Shreveport, LA, says the qualities that have sustained AKA for a century are "sisterhood and service." Her administration is committed to ESP: Economics, Service and Partnership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AKA is the first Greek-letter sorority established by African-American women for African-American, college-educated women. It was founded by nine enterprising Howard University women, led by Ethel Hedgeman Lyle, on January 15, 1908.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the membership has grown to 975 chapters worldwide and is 200,000-strong. Among the famous AKAs are Maya Angelou, Gladys Knight and Alicia Keys; and Members of the House of Representatives include Eddie Bernice Johnson and Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, and Diane Watson of California. Powerful women across America both in the private sector and government represent the AKA sisterhood. Three members of my staff are proud to be a part of this sisterhood: my office manager Alicia Williams, acting  State director Tari Bradford, and my New Orleans constituent services representative Shera&#xE9; Hunter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The AKA sorority, founded before women had the right to vote by women one generation away from slavery, has been an instrumental group in raising the profile of African-American women and has worked tirelessly to knock down barriers to advancement in our society. The sisterhood has consistently encouraged academic achievement, leadership and service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members remain active for their whole lives and are encouraged to contribute to their communities. Each chapter has its own community service focus. The Gamma Eta Omega Alumnae Chapter in Baton Rouge, for instance, raises money through an annual fashion show for scholarships for high school seniors and sorority undergraduates and also sponsors the Leadership Fellows Institute each year to promote leadership among high school students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Delta Lamda Omega Chapter in Shreveport gathers for "A Day On and Not a Day Off," where sisters take off work to volunteer in the community. Chapters all over Louisiana are similarly committed to their communities. In the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, AKAs from all over the country came to the aid of hurricane survivors along the gulf coast and helped with our recovery effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with great pride that we welcome all AKAs to the birthplace of the sisterhood, Washington, DC, as they embark on another groundbreaking century.</paragraph>
