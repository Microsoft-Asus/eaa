    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to remind all Senate Committee chairmen that paragraph 2 of the Standing Rules of the Senate requires each Senate committee to adopt rules to govern its procedures. Under this rule, committee rules may not be inconsistent with the Rules of the Senate and must be published in the Congressional Record not later than March 1, 2007.</paragraph>
