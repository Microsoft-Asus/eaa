  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute Jerry Baker, America's master gardener, as he celebrates his birthday. As a former owner of a nursery business, I've come to appreciate the wit and wisdom that Jerry has given to gardeners across the country for more than three decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jerry has been offering tips for almost as long as I can remember. His folksy and down-to-earth advice has been helping everyone from city dwellers trying to master a finicky herb garden in a window box to longtime gardeners across rural America who produce those ubiquitous wheelbarrows full of zucchini.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to Jerry, our gardens have been producing more with less. Today, with dozens of books full of garden advice in print and a weekly nationwide radio show where he solves the gardening problems of people across the country, Jerry is well-established as America's go-to guy on all things gardening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As he marks one more year on his calendar, I rise to wish him many more years of garden mastering. Happy birthday, Jerry.</paragraph>
