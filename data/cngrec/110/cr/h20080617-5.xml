  <narrative>LOWER GAS AND ENERGY PRICES -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5414]</narrative>
  <chair> The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland) for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to take just a moment, before I start with any of my energy remarks, to welcome President Chen, Joy and Sean Chen here with General Protecht that is opening up a business in my district in Barnesville, Georgia. It's great to have them visiting Washington, D.C.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I really want to talk to the people about today, Mr. Speaker, is the fact that it is time that the American people understand where Congress is on providing them with our own resources to bring about lower gas prices and lower energy prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had several constituents and people e-mailing me and calling me, asking me about a number of petitions that were on the Web or that were in service stations or in Wal-Marts or in Home Depots, and they were wanting to know how I felt about drilling onshore, about drilling in deep water and about bringing more refineries on line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, as I looked at some of these petitions--and some of them I saw--one was on American solutions, and there were others, but the one on American solutions had about 600,000 signatories. Six hundred thousand Americans had taken the time to go to that Web site to sign the petition that said, "Drill now. Drill here. Less price." Less gasoline price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I thought, you know, that's interesting because we know how these constituents feel, but do our constituents really know, Mr. Speaker, how Members of Congress feel? Because we do things up here to keep the American people from knowing exactly what we do think because we make these issues as to so many different subject matters that we can find excuses to vote for or against most any proposal that is brought to this floor. So what I want to do is simplify it, simplify it for the American people--for  our constituents--and, Mr. Speaker, for the Members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I came up with a petition for this House of Representatives, and the petition is simple. The petition says: "American energy solutions for lower gas prices. Bring onshore oil on line. Bring deep water oil on line, and bring new refineries on line."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've got a petition here. Don't worry. This is one board. We've got five boards. We've got every district, all 435 Members who can vote in this House. We've got a petition, and it says, "I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans." How simple is that? That's pretty simple.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we've done is we've got this. Congressman Price and myself didn't bring it out until, really, after everybody had kind of gone home up here last Thursday, and we've already gotten 20 signatories. I've got two pens that I'm going to attach to these petitions. Mr. Speaker, I'm going to put them over here by the back door here on the minority side, and I'm going to invite every Member of Congress who believes that they would vote to reduce these prices to come by and sign them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just to give the American people, Mr. Speaker, a way to look at this, we are going to post, and are going to try to post in as real a time as we can, on different Web pages who has signed it. So, if you want to know who has signed so far, you can go to House.gov/Westmoreland, and you can also go to GOP.gov/energy. Now, these are two Web sites that are going to have posted by the end of the day who all has signed. If you, Mr. Speaker, or if anybody out there might want to know if your Congressman  has signed, then you can go to that Web site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had all different types of arguments in this House about energy, and the Democrats had an energy bill that they proposed and actually passed that President Bush signed into law in December of 2007. The Democratic majority passed this as one of their big issues in January of 2007.</paragraph>

  <chair> The time of the gentleman has expired.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>With that, I'll leave it up to Mr. Price, but for every Member in this House, the pens are here; the petition is here. Let the American people know how you feel.</paragraph>
