    <paragraph>It is a pleasure to stand before this auspicious body yet again and express my farewell and make notice of the kind words so many of my colleagues made about me and my service. It has been a privilege to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this night, I would recognize the death of two friends of mine who provided significant service to the people of southeast Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The electrical workers contracting industry lost a tremendous ambassador and friend when Charles M. "Charlie" LeBlanc died suddenly on Thursday, August 21. Charlie served admirably as the long-time governor of the southeast chapter of NECA. He formed relationships at the local, State, and national level that were very instrumental in benefiting not only NECA, but all of our associated industry partners and friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie LeBlanc's career in the electrical industry began in 1970 when he became indentured as an apprentice in Beaumont, Texas. Charlie accepted employment around this time with Gold Crest Electric Company and formed a friendship with a co-worker, Wayne Brockett, that would transform into a highly successful business partnership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The two hardworking, industrious men formed Crown Electric Company in 1980. Charlie's natural charm and technical acumen was vital in the continuing success of Crown Electric, Incorporated, and made him a favorite with customers, general contractors, engineers, and architects. Charlie's entrepreneurial spirit resulted in a company that has contributed to his community and the electrical contracting industry at large for over 20 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Crown Electric, Inc., became a NECA member in 1987, and Charlie LeBlanc's service to the southeast Texas chapter was immediate, continuous, and resounding. Charlie assumed a position in 1988 on the Chapter Codes and Standards Committee, where he applied his technical expertise for the next three years, and in 1990, Charlie was elected to the chapter board of directors, where he continued to serve until his passing. Charlie served with distinction as chapter treasurer from 1992 to 2000. And he  served concurrently on the Chapter Manpower Development, Membership, and Finance Committees. Charlie sacrificed a great amount of his own personal time in his devotion to chapter affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In addition to service on the board of directors and committees, Charlie served as division chairman of the Coastal Sabine Division for 4 years and has served on every negotiating committee from 1996 to present. Charlie served as trustee on the Greater Texas IBEW-NECA Annuity Fund from 1999 to 2004; trustee on the Southeast Texas Benefit Trust from 1998 to 2008; the Coastal Sabine Labor Management Cooperative Committee from 2001 to 2008; and Charlie served continuously on the Local Union 479  JATC from 1988 to 2008. Charlie's compassionate but firm leadership, especially on the Apprenticeship Committee, has had a profound and lasting effect on generations of apprentices and has left an indelibly positive mark on our industry's most important resource.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His service at the national level began with his appointment to the District V Apprenticeship Committee in 1997. Charlie understood the importance of political action and was selected to serve on the NECA National Governmental Affairs Committee from 2000 to 2001 and again in 2008. Most important to the chapter, Charlie assumed the role of Governor in 2001 and was an extremely effective and well-liked NECA ambassador at all levels of our industry. Charlie applied his boundless energy, infinite  patience, and genuine caring and keen instincts to the service of our industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie LeBlanc managed to devote himself to civic service in the City of Beaumont; service that is important not only to the beneficiaries themselves but to the positive perception of our customers, community leaders, and the IBEW. Charlie served with distinction in the past on the City of Beaumont Electrical Board and the City of Beaumont Board of Electrical Inspectors. Charlie served on the board of directors of the Southeast Texas AGC. He provided service to the Young Men's Business League  and served on the board of directors of Boy's Haven, an outreach program designed to benefit disenfranchised youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie LeBlanc will be terribly missed by all who were privileged to know him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And Charles "Chuck" Wilson, who was the tax assessor/collector for 16 years of Galveston County, Texas, Chuck died the night before last. He was a very dear friend, one who had many friends across southeast Texas and in the profession of property tax assessors and collectors across the State of Texas, and he too will be missed. His family loved him and he was known and loved by many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been a privilege to stand before the body of the United States House of Representatives for 10 years. I am wishing my friends and colleagues a farewell and Godspeed on the business of the United States of America. I wish them well.</paragraph>
