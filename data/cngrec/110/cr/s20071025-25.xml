  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="TRIBUTE TO DAVID TAWEI LEE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge the service of Representative David Tawei Lee, who has given nearly 3 years of exceptional service as Taiwan's principal representative to the United States. Representative Lee recently departed Washington, DC, to take on his next assignment as Taiwan's Representative to Canada. He leaves behind a legacy of friendship, prosperity, and understanding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Representative Lee arrived in Washington, he came equipped with a wealth of experience and insight. A foremost expert on U.S.-Taiwan relations, Mr. Lee has studied, written, and published on U.S.-Taiwan political and economic ties, including the development of the Taiwan Relations Act. I believe Representative Lee will be remembered not only for his excellent knowledge of history but also for his accomplishments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While serving in Washington, Representative Lee dedicated his energy, intelligence, and spirit to expanding Taiwan-American ties. He raised the cultural and political profile of Taiwan and its people with cultural and education programs. To enhance our economic ties, Representative Lee oversaw the successful acceleration of our bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement talks. And he worked tirelessly to raise awareness of the benefits of a potential U.S.-Taiwan Free Trade Agreement. In these areas  alone, he has left a legacy of which he should take pride.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative Lee's dedication and efforts were also felt far beyond our Nation's Capital. Three years ago, I was delighted to personally welcome Mr. Lee to my home State of Montana. There he witnessed Big Sky Country in all of its glory, making friends with hospitable and generous Montanans. But together we also saw the deep and healthy roots of the Montana-Taiwan economic relationship. At its core are Montana's finest agricultural products, which have long found their way to Taiwanese dinner  tables and bakeries. Today, Taiwan purchases over 30 million bushels of Montana wheat annually. Our fine Montana beef is also in demand. This relationship benefits families in both Montana and Taiwan. And I hope it will continue to grow stronger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has truly been a pleasure to work with Representative Lee. His personal touch to everything he did will not be forgotten. And the value of his contributions will be remembered for many years to come. I wish him luck in all of his future endeavors.</paragraph>
