    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning there will be a period of 60 minutes for morning business. The majority will control the first 30 minutes and the Republicans the second 30 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following morning business, the Senate will resume the motion to proceed to <bill type="s" number="372">S. 372</bill>, the Intelligence authorization bill, and vote soon thereafter on a motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed. I have been advised that the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Rockefeller, will be on the floor and will speak prior to the vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later today, I will have more to say about the schedule for the remainder of this week. A lot will depend on what happens in the motion to proceed on the Intelligence bill.</paragraph>
