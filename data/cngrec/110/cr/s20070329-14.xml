  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the fiscal year 2007 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill, just approved by the Senate, includes over $96 billion for the troops. It includes increases above the President's request for the Department of Defense, including increases of $1.3 billion for defense health, $1 billion for equipping the National Guard and Reserve, and $1.1 billion for military housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill includes $6.7 billion for rebuilding the gulf coast region following Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. It includes $4.2 billion for agricultural disaster relief. It includes nearly $1.8 billion for the VA to make sure that we meet our moral obligation to provide first-class health care to our wounded veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most importantly, with passage of this bill, the Senate sends a clear message to the President that we must take the war in Iraq in a new direction. Setting a goal for getting most of our troops out of Iraq is not cutting and running. The new direction provides incentives to the Iraqi people to settle their differences, to end their civil war, and to pursue reconciliation. One fact is plainly clear: The President wants to run his war his way, without anyone asking any questions or requiring any  standards of progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the kind of attitude that has resulted in the chaos we see in Iraq each day. President Bush does not want anyone to hold him accountable for the failures in Iraq. He does not want anyone to hold him responsible for our troops remaining caught in the escalating Iraqi civil war. The President has his eyes closed to the truth in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me read excerpts from a letter I recently received from soldiers serving in and around Baghdad:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We write you this letter. . . , Senator Byrd, because of your prominent role as Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and because of your documented observation of the alarming lack of debate within the Senate over the Iraq War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So much of the controversy surrounding the proposed surge strategy has hinged on "support for our troops." Yet, the voice of the individual trooper is not heard. As volunteer members of the military, we waive certain civil rights. We cannot quit. We have a legal and moral responsibility to carry out  the orders given. We offer our bodies and minds, but sacrifice our voices. Our voice is in our vote. Last November, we voted for a Congress that would  halt the disastrous Iraq War. . . .</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of us are on our first tour, some our second or third, and for one of us, fifth. We have done our duty, and will continue to do so until our obligation is complete. Upon completion of our obligation, we hope to close this unhappy chapter in our lives and move forward. . . .</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Listening to the ongoing debate in the news, and the conflicting views of our lawmakers, we hear again and again accusations by one side of the other side's desire to undercut the troops. We see these accusations as moral blackmail. For it is overwhelmingly clear from all of our experiences that despite the unpopularity of this war, the American people have provided unfaltering moral support to the men and women of the military. We implore lawmakers to  abandon these hollow accusations, and to focus on the national interest as a whole. We earnestly hope for the enactment of the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, particularly those concerning the de-escalation of the war and direct diplomatic engagement of Syria and Iran. We encourage Congress to obstruct the escalation of this war by any means possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Continuing to read from the letter, these solders said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, we have become painfully aware of our own vulnerability. We have spent vast resources preparing for unknown disaster, fighting an enemy that is ubiquitous, but not clearly defined. We are fighting the specter of fear. This is an internal struggle that we must reconcile. Our vision of the future has grown clouded and ominous. We face a situation in Iraq that leaves us with little hope for a satisfying outcome. As a nation, we must recover from the  trauma of 9/11 and abandon the misguided policies we have pursued in its wake. Using the military as our primary foreign policy tool has isolated us and fueled worldwide resentment of us, and has not increased our sense of security. Halting the Iraq war is America's opportunity to change direction, to reengage the world, and discourage terrorism and extremism by showing the world the ingenuity of our people and our commitment to freedom and democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the written words of soldiers now serving in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people want our troops out of Iraq. The Congress has said very clearly that we want our military to refocus on Osama bin Laden and his terrorist bases in Afghanistan. The President has said he will veto this bill. His administration has asserted that adding funds for caring for our wounded veterans, for rebuilding the gulf coast, for securing the homeland, and for agricultural disaster assistance is playing politics. What nonsense. With approval of this bill, Congress will have appropriated</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that the President will drop his rhetoric and instead work with Congress to craft a responsible plan to transition our forces from Iraq and refocus on bin Laden and his base of operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of demonizing the Congress and engaging in rhetorical finger-pointing, the President ought to work with Congress on legislation that is in the best interests of the country. I want to thank Senator Cochran, Senator Murray, Senator Reid, and Senator McConnell for their efforts this week in moving this bill through the Senate. I also want to thank the Appropriations Committee staff, including Terry Sauvain, Charles Kieffer, Peter Rogoff, B.G. Wright,  Kate Fitzpatrick, Bruce Evans, Blake Thompson, and all of the Subcommittee staffs for their hard work on this bill.</paragraph>
