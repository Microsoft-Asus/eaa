  <chair> Under the previous order, there will be a period for the transaction of morning business until 4 p.m., with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, with up to 60 minutes under the control of the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object, I inquire, at what point can other Senators speak? I presume at the conclusion of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia; is that correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> We have--</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Might I make that a unanimous consent, that I can be recognized following the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for 10 minutes?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The order is first the assistant majority leader gets 10 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>All right. That is fine. And I notice the presence of the assistant Republican leader, so I would want to accommodate the assistant Republican leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At some point, I am just asking, as a matter of courtesy, at what time may I speak? The Senator from Maine, Senator Hagel--there are several Members who would like to speak. If the Chair could help us, recognizing the leadership precedes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>What is the order that has been previously entered?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> There is no order in effect except for Senator Durbin and Senator Byrd.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Could I then ask unanimous consent at the appropriate time that the Senator from Virginia be recognized for 10 minutes, the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Nebraska for 10 minutes?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I believe if Senator Durbin and Senator Byrd speak before we get into the rest of the lineup, I would like to have an opportunity to have at least 5 minutes to speak after Durbin and Byrd but then go forward with the unanimous consent request of Senator Warner for himself and others.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The assistant majority leader.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am not sure a unanimous consent has been propounded, but  I would like to modify what is pending as follows: I have a hearing to chair at 3 o'clock. I have been allocated 10 minutes. I would like to use 5 and give 5 to the Senator from New York and allow the other Senators--I have noted several Republican Senators who wish to speak for whatever period the Senator from West Virginia would be prepared to work out with them. He was kind enough  to allow me 10 minutes, which I will share with the Senator from New York if it meets with the approval of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me defer to the Senator from West Virginia because I believe under the existing order I have 10 minutes and he has 1 hour, if I am not mistaken; is that correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The 60 minutes reserved for Senator Byrd is not necessarily following your 10 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>If I might inquire of the Chair, then, is the 60 minutes for Senator Byrd reserved after morning business or during morning business?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> During morning business.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>I defer to the Senator from West Virginia because he made the earlier request and was kind enough to yield 10 minutes my way, and I want to make sure he agrees with whatever we tend to think is a reasonable way to allocate time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I don't believe there is any order in place that Senator Byrd would go next even though there was, I believe, an order that he have an hour as if in morning business; is that correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> That is correct.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>My only reservation, not wanting in any way to cut off any Senator, is that there be some flow of back-and-forth after the distinguished whip has his time, along with Senator Schumer; that some of us be able to comment in response, perhaps; and that Senator Byrd, certainly, get his time, but Senator Warner would also have an opportunity to get engaged in this lineup, and Senator Collins.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Would the Senator from Mississippi propound a unanimous consent request based on that so we can decide whether that would be an appropriate way to proceed?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the 10 minutes that has been allocated for Senator Durbin as he would see fit to use his time, that I have 10 minutes, to be followed by the time Senator Byrd has, to be followed by Senator Warner, an equal amount of time as he would see fit.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what is the request?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>I believe Senator Durbin would have 10 minutes as yielded by you, Senator Byrd, then I would have 10 minutes, to be followed by your time that you have requested, to be followed by Senator Warner and others as they would want to divide up that time. So we all would basically have an equal amount of time to go forward, but after an estimated 20 minutes, you would have your time to go forward.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Is that the order that has been established or is that the request?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is the request.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>But the order as established is what, may I ask the Chair?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> There is no order established. We have Senator Durbin who is recognized for 10 minutes. The Senator from West Virginia has 60 minutes although there is no order established. In other words, it is not locked in that the Senator from West Virginia go immediately after Senator Durbin.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, what is the order?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Mississippi has proposed an order where he would give 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois, which I assume is 5 for the Senator from Illinois and 5 for the Senator from New York, although it is 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I do not mean to be contentious, but what is the order without the request?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The order without the request is Senator Durbin, from Illinois, is recognized for</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Following that, if there is no sequence laid out, I would like for my time to follow the Senator from Illinois, and then we can talk about my time if Senators want some of it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, after Senator Durbin and perhaps Senator Schumer speak, my request was propounded on the basis that we try to go back and forth between the two parties and that I be allowed to have an equal amount of time in response to the remarks of Senator Durbin and then go forward with an order that would put Senator Byrd next in order, to be followed by Senator Warner. I am just trying to establish some fair flow back and forth.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object, is there a previous order to the effect that I have an hour?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator is correct.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>All right. The previous order is that I have an hour. When should I have the hour under the previous order?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> That is what is trying to be worked out right now. Right now, the Chair asks the Senator from West Virginia if the Senator intends to use the full hour and if the Senator would like it all in one block or if the Senator would prefer to break it up?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>I don't know yet, but I want the hour.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> In one block?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want the hour.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The full hour.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>An hour is a full hour.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Uninterrupted?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>As of now, I want the hour.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>Parliamentary inquiry: While there is an order that Senator Byrd have an hour, it was not put in place at a particular time or to follow in any particular order; is that correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator is correct.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes. My objection as of this point----</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New York.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300087" topic="">
    <paragraph>If I could suggest, to speed this up, if instead of taking the 5 minutes Senator Durbin was going to yield me, I would be happy to defer and let Senator Lott speak for that 5 minutes, and after Senator Byrd finishes his remarks, I could speak my 5 minutes. That way we would have an order, and Senator Byrd would not have to yield any more time, and all of us would get to say whatever we wanted to say. I make that a unanimous consent request.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object, could then the three colleagues I have mentioned--myself, Senator Collins, and Senator Hagel--follow the distinguished Senator from New York?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300087" topic="">
    <paragraph>I have no problem with that.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from West Virginia.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, had an order been previously entered for me to have an hour?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator is correct.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>All right. I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's proceed under the order.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> And also, the next Senator to be recognized is the Senator from Illinois.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>The Senator from Illinois, all right.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the Chair yield for a question?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Absolutely.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Is there a record vote scheduled at 5:30 on the cloture motion?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> There is a vote scheduled under a previous unanimous consent at 5:30.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 10 minutes before that vote be equally divided between the majority and minority so that at 5:20 a person speaking--sorry. I withdraw that request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as I understand it, I am recognized for 10 minutes at this point?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> That is correct.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>My intention is to yield 5 minutes to Senator Schumer. So I will begin at this point.</paragraph>
