  <speaking speaker="412189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Today it gives me great pleasure to rise in honor of Staff Sergeant Michael Broussard of Contra Costa County's own Brentwood, California, for winning the 25th Best Ranger Competition, one of the Army's athletic achievements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Held at Fort Benning, Georgia, the competition tests a Ranger's physical and mental toughness and self-discipline. Of the 28 participants, only 16 were able to complete the grueling 3-day athletic competition, which features some of the best athletes in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite this honor, I believe Staff Sergeant Broussard's greatest achievement is that he repeatedly served this Nation with distinction by completing two deployments to Iraq and two deployments to Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Broussard is a true American hero and an example of the commitment, dedication, and capability of our men and women in uniform on and off the battlefield.</paragraph>
