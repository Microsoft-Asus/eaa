    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the great work and remarkable accomplishments of Moorpark High School's Academic Decathlon team for winning the 2008 U.S. Academic Decathlon Championship. Members of the National Championship team include Jonah Buck, Anaamika Campeau, Angela Chen, Justine Levan, Chrissa Rutkai, Kris Sankaran, Paul Watanabe, Christie Calle, Colin Calle, and team coach Larry Jones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moorpark High School has earned the distinction of becoming a three-time U.S. Academic Decathlon Champion, having previously won the prestigious competition in 1999 and 2003. The 2008 Moorpark High School Academic Decathlon team achieved the highest score in the U.S. Academic Decathlon's 26-year history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Competing in an academic decathlon requires hard work, dedication, and determination. These dedicated students from Moorpark High School devoted many hours of their leisure time honing their skills in preparation for the Academic Decathlon competition. Their commitment to excellence has rightfully earned them the respect and admiration of their community, friends, and family. The 2008 Moorpark High School Academic Decathlon team is a great source of pride and joy to their community and is a great  testament to the value of team work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I invite all of my colleagues to join me in congratulating California's Moorpark High School Academic Decathlon team for winning the 2008 U.S. Academic Decathlon Championships.</paragraph>
