  <speaking speaker="400384" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we will consider the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two Federal commissions, one in 1947 and the other in 2004, recommended to the Congress that the people of Guam have not been made whole despite efforts to rehabilitate their lives and livelihoods that were destroyed during Guam's occupation by Japanese Imperial Forces during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two Federal commissions have spoken about the atrocities of war they lived through: beheadings by public executions, rapes and torture. Two Federal commissions have underscored that the patriotism of the people of Guam during their occupation was unquestionable. Two Federal commissions recommended we make additional reparations to give them justice and parity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is past time that Congress heeds the recommendations of both Federal commissions to recognize their loyalty and patriotism. I urge my colleagues today to vote in favor of <bill type="h" number="1595">H.R. 1595</bill>, the Guam World War II Loyalty Act.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
