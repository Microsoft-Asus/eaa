    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the immeasurable contributions of fathers in the lives of children, especially as we prepare to celebrate Father's Day this Sunday, June 17. While the amount of time a father spends with his child can be quantified, the total contribution to his child's healthy development cannot. Children with involved fathers tend to do better in school, have fewer behavioral problems and demonstrate greater self-control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Supportive fathers also promote the positive physical, social, emotional, and mental development of their children. Responsible fatherhood can increase the chances children will grow up with two caring parents. Additionally, it can lead to reduction in child poverty and strengthen families as well as communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as we come upon Father's Day, we would like to recognize and thank the fathers throughout this country who play an active role in the lives of their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass House Resolution 474, recognizing the contributions of fathers in the healthy development of children, supporting responsible fatherhood and encouraging greater involvement of fathers in the lives of their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a proud father of two, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 474, recognizing the immeasurable contribution of fathers in the healthy development of  children, supporting responsible fatherhood, and encouraging greater involvement of fathers in the lives of their children, especially on Father's Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>William Shakespeare wrote, "It is a wise father that knows his own child." The truism of these words is exceedingly relevant today. The presence of two committed, involved parents contributes directly to better academic performance, reduced substance abuse, less crime and delinquency, fewer emotional and other behavioral problems, less risk of abuse and neglect and lower risk of teen suicide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The research is clear: Fathers factor significantly in the lives of their children. There is simply no substitute for the love, involvement and commitment of a responsible father.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fathers of yesteryear thought that merely being a good provider meant that they were good fathers. Fathers today have the responsibility to set aside quality time for their children in ways that may contribute to happy memories that last a lifetime. Fathers realize that their time with children is really an investment in them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Being an involved father is good for children and good for fathers. And while each father is a unique person who parents in his own way and style, there are some characteristics that good fathers have in common. Good fathers are involved in the lives of their children. They attend their children's school events, games and activities. They also involve their children in their lives and the adult world by taking them to see the workplace, taking them along when the car needs to be repaired or involving  them in decisions that affect the family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Good fathers set limits and are firm. They let their children know their beliefs and expectations but rely on explanations and reasoning rather than force. Indeed, today's lifestyles are changing. More and more fathers are effectively balancing their personal, work, and family times. Both children and fathers are realizing the importance of the father's role, and there are ever-increasing amounts of research being conducted on the father's role in today's families. These findings document the  importance of the father's role, the profound influence of fathers in children's growth and development, and the characteristics that good fathers have in common.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fathers play a significant role in shaping the character of their children. By spending time with their sons and daughters, being stern yet fair disciplinarians, and listening to their experiences, fathers mold and shape their children into the men and women they will become. As advisers and role models, fathers help their children to understand the difference between right and wrong and to recognize how the decisions they make today can affect the rest of their lives. Fathers instill important  values that prepare their children for the challenges and opportunities ahead by demonstrating true leadership. Their love and devotion inspire the future generation of Americans to achieve their dreams and demonstrate the true spirit of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A father is one of the most important influences in a child's life. On Father's Day and every day, we honor our fathers and celebrate the special bond between a father and a child. I am honored to rise today in support of this resolution and in honoring all of our fathers for the roles that they play and for the love they give.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I request 5 legislative days during which Members may insert materials relevant to House Resolution 474 into the Record.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to a member of the House Education and Labor Committee, my good friend, Representative Davis from Illinois.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>First of all, I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Illinois, for yielding time, and I also want to commend him for the tremendous leadership that he continues to play, even as a new Member of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="474">H. Res. 474</bill> and take this opportunity to congratulate all of my colleagues who hold the honor and privilege of fatherhood. It is widely understood and acknowledged that the benefits of an actively involved father in the lives of children not only helps but plays a vital role in the formation of successful youth and in the development of contributing members of society. It should come as no surprise that, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human  Services, fatherless children are at a dramatically greater risk of drug and alcohol abuse. We know that fatherless children are twice as likely to drop out of school. Just over 41 percent of fatherless families with children are poor, while only 7 percent of children headed by a married couple are considered poor. Furthermore, over two-thirds of mother-only families live twice below the poverty line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our work today and our work in Congress should not only focus on acknowledging fatherhood but it should focus on empowering fathers to have the capabilities and incentives to be more responsible for their children. Barriers to employment, such as a lack of high school or college degree, as well as criminal histories and substance abuse, all contribute to the lack of fathers in the household and the lack of a regular source of income and the ability to contribute to the family. It is not enough  to fill this room with words. The only way to improve the ever-increasing number of families without fathers is through targeting the problems that fathers face by going to the source. One way of doing this is through support of the Responsible Fatherhood and Healthy Families Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Social scientists have for years debated the role of the father in the family. It is consistently among the top interest of psychologists. Leading professionals indicate that fathers provide role models for their sons to learn how to be a man, whereas girls need fathers to learn how to relate to a man in significant ways. Fathers also tend to constrain and correct violent and antisocial behavior better than anyone else, as well as challenge and promote such characteristics as independence, assertiveness,  and achievement. But this is not a new phenomenon. George Herbert, the famous medieval poet and orator, understood. He said that one father is more than a hundred schoolmasters. How true that word is today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I conclude, Mr. Speaker, by remembering the fact that every year I give away scholarships, money that we go out and kind of find for kids to go to college. And on the form, there is an application that says, put down the name of your mother and father, what they do. I must confess that I have been most disheartened, because in some instances children have written on the application form, DNA, meaning that the name of the father does not apply. In some instances they have even written "unknown."  Or in other instances they have written "irrelevant." Or "does not matter." If we are to strengthen families, if we are to strengthen our society, then we must find a way to help so many of the individuals who have been out of the picture to cop back in and take on their responsible role of fatherhood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman again from Illinois for yielding time. I thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I also use this moment to say thank you to my own father who died 2 years ago, 92 years old. Much of the reason that I stand here today is because of him.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412235" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield as much time as he may consume to my good friend and fellow Tennessean, Mr. Duncan.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400116" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to first thank the gentleman from Tennessee for yielding me this time. I want to also commend the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McIntyre) for bringing  this resolution before us today and commend all of the cosponsors, Mr. Davis and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, some people might think this is an insignificant resolution. I think there is probably very little that we could talk about today that would be more important than fatherhood and the important role it plays in the life of this Nation. This was brought home to me most vividly in January 1981 when I became judge of the criminal court in Knox County, Tennessee, trying felony criminal cases, the murders, rapes, armed robberies, the most serious cases. I was told that first day by Gary  Tullock, the chief probation counselor for east Tennessee, 16 counties in east Tennessee, that 98 percent of the defendants in felony cases came from father-absent households. I'm not sure that it is quite that high, but I know it's well over 90 percent. It's the entire crime problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hasten to say that I know many good people have come from father-absent households, but I also know that children cannot raise themselves. And because 96 or 97 percent of the people plead guilty in criminal cases and then apply for probation, I went through over 10,000 cases in the 7 1/2  years that I served as judge. I cannot tell you how many times I read over and over and over and over again: "Defendant's father left home to get pack of cigarettes and never came back." "Defendant's father  left home when defendant was 2 and never returned."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I can say this, that father-absent households not only are the root of our crime problem, all the things like drugs and alcohol and all of that come secondary. I know there are exceptions to everything that you say, but we need to get into the minds of our young people and teach them how important it is that fathers don't desert their children as so many millions of fathers have unfortunately over the years and have gone out of the lives of their children much to the detriment of those  young people and to the detriment of this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support this resolution and I commend all of those who have brought this to the floor today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="474">H. Res. 474</bill>, recognizing the immeasurable contributions of fathers in the healthy development of children, supporting responsible fatherhood, and encouraging greater involvement of fathers in the lives of our children, especially on this coming Father's Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman George Miller, Ranking Member McKeon, and all of the members on the Education and Labor Committee. And I would like to thank Mr. Hare for supporting this resolution and helping to bring it to the floor this week. I also want to thank the staff of the National Fatherhood Initiative for their assistance with this resolution and their tireless efforts on a year-around basis to promote responsible fatherhood across this great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Father's Day was first conceived in 1909 by Sonora Dodd in Spokane, Washington. In 1966, President Lyndon Johnson issued a Presidential proclamation designating the third Sunday in June as Father's Day. And in 1972, President Richard Nixon signed a public law making that public designation permanent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here in Congress I am grateful we have an opportunity to have a task force on fatherhood promotion that also works on a year-round basis with the National Fatherhood Initiative and with many Members of Congress on a bipartisan basis to support the positive initiatives of involving fathers in their children's lives and honoring those fathers on a national basis who have been upheld for making a difference in children's lives everywhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a task force that Congressman Joe Pitts and I started 11 years ago when we first came to Congress, and I am thrilled that over the last decade and past year that it has gone well, and we have an opportunity each year to come to the floor with a resolution such as this one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Sunday, June 17, Americans will celebrate Father's Day once again. We use this day to honor the contributions made by the estimated 64.3 million fathers in the United States. We also use this day to encourage all fathers to reflect on the responsibility fathering a child requires and the importance of their involvement in the lives of their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With two sons of my own, Joshua and Stephen, who have been here often on this floor, I know firsthand the rewards and responsibilities of being a father; and I am grateful, indeed, to my own father, Dr. Douglas McIntyre, back home in Lumberton, North Carolina, for his impact upon my life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is only appropriate that Father's Day be a tribute, that we here in the U.S. House of Representatives pass this resolution in recognition of the contributions of fathers everywhere. I strongly encourage all of my colleagues to support this.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I just want to briefly close by saying something about my own father.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman from Tennessee was talking about his dad, I have three sisters, and I can remember my dad having to work three jobs to make ends meet for our family. I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for him. I miss him terribly. He has been gone a number of years, but today, as we honor fathers, I remember him and thank him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing my dad did every night when we had dinner, when he could make it, was to tell a joke to my three sisters and myself. He said this world is such a serious place to live in, every now and then you need to laugh and smile. I remember that each and every day. I hope my father gave me sense of humor that sometimes people find a little annoying.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400429" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="474">H. Res. 474</bill>. As we approach Father's Day weekend, it is appropriate for us to recognize the importance of fathers in the lives of their children. Children who live with their fathers do better in school, are less likely to use drugs or engage in other criminal behavior, and are less likely to experience health, emotional, or behavioral problems. In so many ways, involved fathers provide needed support for their children and  serve as role models as they develop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, too many children today do not live with or even frequently see their fathers. This has forced millions of young mothers across the Nation to single-handedly raise their children, struggling to provide them with the love and support needed to succeed in today's world. It is a sad reality that for millions of children, their mother has to play the role of both mom and dad, a task that is not only difficult for the mother but which despite her efforts far too often results in that  child living in poverty, among other challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To help address this situation, the 1996 welfare reform law included promoting marriage and family formation and the maintenance of two-parent families as key purposes of welfare programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the direction of the Ways and Means Committee on which I serve, legislation reauthorizing the 1996 welfare reform law in the last Congress included specific funding for healthy marriage and fatherhood grant programs to improve the well-being of children. These fatherhood grants were designed to promote responsible fatherhood by funding projects developed by public, private, and often faith-based groups to help fathers establish positive relationships with their children and the children's  mothers, improve job skills, increase child support payments, and promote marriage among parents. Activities can include counseling, mentoring, providing information about the benefits of marriage and two-parent involvement for children and the prevention of domestic violence and child abuse, financial planning seminars, and education on good parenting practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last October, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced $119 million in awards to 225 grantees for promotion of healthy marriages and responsible fatherhood. These grants are designed to make a difference in the lives of children, fathers, and families by supporting groups already at work trying to help men become better fathers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we honor our own fathers this week, we should also thank those who are working every day to help more men become better fathers. The last Congress took concrete steps to support them. In the congressional district I represent, a recent fatherhood event took place that is described in the June 11 Catholic News Service article, provided below. As efforts such as this and those supported by the recent Federal grants take hold, we will be</paragraph>
    <paragraph>watching for evidence that more children are  spending every day, and not just Father's Day, with an involved and supportive father.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fathers' Involvement Key in Lives of Children, Says Catholic Charities Conference</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JOLIET, IL. (CNS).--A convicted drug dealer, 28-year-old Exulam Holman knows his actions have caused pain to those closest to him. The father of three young children, former gang member and ex-addict was released three months ago from prison. Today, he is desperately trying to put his life in order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Holman's painstaking quest to reclaim his life spurred him to take part in a fatherhood conference sponsored by Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Joliet. "I want to make things right for my kids," he told the Catholic Explorer, Joliet diocesan newspaper, during the June 2 event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I've messed up," he said. "But I've asked God to help me. I have to get myself right with God."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>About 100 people attended the third annual conference, aimed at getting fathers more involved in the lives of their children, said Ronald Roseboro, site supervisor of early childhood services for Catholic Charities and coordinator of the event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fathers of children in the agency's early childhood programs were encouraged to attend the gathering, said Roseboro. Other fathers from Joliet and surrounding communities were also invited to attend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The presence of two nurturing parents minimizes the possibility their children will abuse drugs or alcohol, join gangs or involve themselves in other dangerous situations, said Roseboro. A father's leadership and guidance has a definite impact on his children's lives, he continued. "It's like dropping a pebble into a pond and watching the ripples it makes."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Guest speakers from diverse backgrounds led various workshops during the conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A father of five, Rev. Eugene Fears, pastor of Joliet's Redeem Church of God in Christ, spoke of healthy relationships. The no-nonsense preacher relied on his own experiences to build a case for sound communication and devotion between spouses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"A commitment pushes through adversity," he told conference participants. He urged the men to "learn to make adjustments" and to avoid "self-centered" attitudes. "We need to learn to give of ourselves," Rev. Fears said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fathers who leave and don't compensate their families are often called "deadbeat dads," but the reality is they are often simply "dead broke," Warren Cottrell, director of the Joliet branch of the Illinois Child Support Enforcement program, said in an interview with the Explorer. He was on hand to field questions from participants during the conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most fathers understand their responsibilities. They choose to turn their backs on their families, however, when they realize they cannot adequately provide for them. "It's the male ego," said Cottrell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Applauding Catholic Charities for broaching the topic with the conference, the administrator noted that fathers must be encouraged to do the right thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cottrell said the welfare system in Illinois has many cracks. Jobless fathers are leaving their families so mothers can qualify for government aid. There are countless programs for single mothers in need of assistance. At the. same time, government programs need to be created to educate fathers and provide them with skills to remain with their families, he said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Darnell Terrell's children participate in the Catholic Charities Head Start program at St. John's Head Start Center in Joliet. The owner of a disc-jockey business and father of six praised the other men who attended the conference. "It takes a real man to listen to others about fatherhood responsibilities."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kenneth White and Donald Waddell, human services consultants and family counselors, shared startling statistics compiled by the National Fatherhood Initiative during their workshop. The findings highlight the fact that the absence of fathers has a serious effect on families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 70 percent of teens who have committed homicide grew up without fathers. Approximately 60 percent of rapists were raised in fatherless homes. Three out of four teen suicides occur in single-parent families. And the list goes on and on, they said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Substance abuse fuels domestic problems that work to break families apart, according to the two experts in the field. Presenting a workshop on the effects of addiction on fatherhood, White and Waddell described the impact that narcotics and alcohol have on the family unit and discussed some proven methods for combating the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Addiction among parents needs to be addressed and curbed, Waddell told the Explorer, because children of parents who abuse drugs often become addicted themselves during adolescence and later in life. "We want to break that cycle," he said.</paragraph>
