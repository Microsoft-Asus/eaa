    <paragraph>Mr. President, I conferred with Senator Levin. It is clear in our minds that we should proceed on this bill. I think we are making progress on it. We may be able to finish this bill. There was some consideration given to filing cloture, but we both agreed that there is no need to do that; that we may be able to complete this legislation this week, and I hope in fact that is the case.</paragraph>
