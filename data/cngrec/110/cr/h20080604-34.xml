    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to present the United States Capitol Police Administrative Technical Corrections Act of 2008. As its title suggests, <bill type="h" number="5972">H.R. 5972</bill> is not intended to make substantive policy changes for the Capitol Police. It corrects drafting errors, modernizes outdated terms, and repeals redundant and inconsistent provisions already on the books.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My favorite correction is a long overdue repeal of the 1868 law requiring Capitol Police officers to buy their uniforms. Congress decided years ago to provide their uniforms, but has never repealed the 1868 law. Chief Phillip Morse requested most of these corrections, the committee found others, and we included several excellent suggestions offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers). Again, it was a pleasure to work with him and his staff, as always.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill has the support of Chief Morse and our House Sergeant-at-Arms, Wilson Livingood, and I urge an "aye" vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="5972">H.R. 5972</bill>. While I would have preferred that we would have addressed these items in regular order, I am pleased that the proposed technical corrections in this bill will create a stronger operational framework for the Capitol Police. As often happens when language is tied to an appropriations bill in a hasty fashion, several requirements in the original legislation governing Capitol Police operations proved problematic under greater scrutiny  and further use. This bill will bring clarity to the administration of the U.S. Capitol Police and will eliminate those provisions which are in conflict with one another or are antiquated and therefore unnecessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also point out that this illustrates the importance of the appropriations subcommittees to work together with the authorizing committees, because virtually all the problems that have arisen in the past in this area resulted from a lack of cooperation between the authorizing and appropriating committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The changes specified in this bill will also establish a transparent and decisive governance framework and create a clear reporting structure within the U.S. Capitol Police. The clarified language provides the Chief of the Capitol Police with explicit authority to perform all hiring and termination actions, which will assist the U.S. Capitol Police's legal staff in executing its duties regarding personnel matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also clarifies that the Capitol Police must notify this committee, as well as the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, of substantive administrative and operational actions, such as notices of personnel actions or deployment of personnel outside of the Capitol Police's jurisdiction. This language further strengthens this committee's function as an oversight body and allows us to address any such issues as they occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Chairman BRADY for his work on this bill, which will, upon its passage, create a stronger law enforcement organization, and a safer, more secure Capitol complex.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400047" topic="">
    <paragraph>I have no further speakers.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>I have no further speakers. I will make some concluding comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my chairman, Mr. Brady. He and I have worked very, very well together on a number of issues, and I believe that, if there were a competition, we would probably hold the prize among the committees of the House as to the best functioning committees who really try to get business done without a lot of partisanship. I commend my colleague for his great attitude on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One other comment I will make in regard to the Capitol Police. The one area we did not examine, which I think needs examination at some point, and I hope our committee will take it up at some point, the duties of the Capitol Police Board are not as clearly outlined as they might be. The composition, I believe, is lacking. We have a GAO report of a few years ago which pointed out some severe shortcomings in the operations and decision-making processes of the Capitol Police Board, and I think we  would be well-served in this institution to re-examine that issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have done so much in the past decade to modernize the police force; make them provide more ready responses to the trauma that we face today in this time of terrorism. I think we would be well-advised to look at the governing structure once again too, which to my knowledge, has not been examined for a long time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I will yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400047" topic="">
    <paragraph>Again, I thank the gentleman from Michigan. He is right: it is a pleasure to work together. I look forward to working together with you in your interest on the Capitol Police Board. With that, I urge an "aye" vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brady) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="5972">H.R. 5972</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
