  <narrative>ENERGY SPECULATION -- (Senate - July 16, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="6799">S6799</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the bill that was read for the second time is a bill I introduced last night and put on the calendar. I attended a chairmen's meeting 2 weeks ago today. Much of the discussion at that meeting was on gas prices. Much of the discussion on gas prices dealt with speculation. The chairs of that meeting asked if I would prepare a piece of legislation dealing with speculation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what this is all about. There are four or five Democratic proposals, there are some bipartisan proposals dealing with speculation. That is what the bill that I have introduced does. It takes some from all of those, what we believe is a good part of these bills and brings it to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There might be perfection in some things, but legislation is not one of them. It is very difficult to get something that is absolutely perfect. So this bill is not perfect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is speculation a problem? Of course, it is a problem. Is it the problem? No. But it is an issue we must deal with. So I would hope in the near future to bring this bill to the floor as a starting point for us to have some discussion as it relates to energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In arriving at the point where we introduced this bill, I had a meeting last Thursday, where we had people from the financial management world, banks, academics. We had, for example, one person who is the chief executive officer of United Airlines, who previously was chairman of Texaco and vice chairman of Chevron, who has a unique view as to what is going on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His airline, all airlines in the country, are in deep trouble. He sees it from the perspective of someone running a major airline, United Airlines, and also having run major oil companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These academics, and you will see the writers, believe that probably speculation amounts to about 30 percent of the cost of a gallon of gasoline. Now, the bill that has been introduced does a  number of things. It closes the London loophole, which prevents traders in the U.S. oil energy commodities from going overseas to evade regulatory requirements in the U.S. exchanges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It directs the Commission to work with international regulators to develop uniform international reporting standards. It eliminates excessive speculation. It requires the Commission to set position limits on traders who are not involved in legitimate hedge trading of energy commodities, requires large trader reporting, requires large traders of energy commodities in over-the-counter markets to file reports of their activity with the Commission and directs the Commission to step in whenever a  major market disruption occurs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It makes index traders and swap dealers report. These market participants must routinely provide detailed reporting to the Commission to ensure that their activity is not adversely impacting price in any negative fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It increases the CFTC enforcement resources. It directs the Commission to hire an additional 100 employees to improve enforcement transparency. It makes energy markets more transparent by directing the Department of Energy to collect information, analyze market data, and investigate financial institution investments in natural gas markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had a number of informal discussions with the Republican leader. I hope this piece of legislation dealing with speculation, which we hope will be bipartisan in nature, will be the beginning of our having a good discussion on energy prices, before we leave for the August recess.</paragraph>
