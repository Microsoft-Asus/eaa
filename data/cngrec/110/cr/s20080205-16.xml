  <narrative>DISABLED VETERANS -- (Senate - February 05, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="622">S622</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412244" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this week the Senate will hopefully begin debate on an economic stimulus package. Front and center in the debate will be how we balance the need to get our economy going while once again addressing issues that revolve around the national debt. I hope there is one thing this body will agree on unanimously, that we must not forget America's disabled veterans in the debate. Earlier today I heard Members on the floor talk about pet projects. Veterans issues are an important  project to me, and I will not forget about disabled vets as we move forward with this economic stimulus package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are about 2.8 million vets who receive some form of disability through the VA. The good news is that most of these folks hold down other employment and would get a tax rebate through the House's economic stimulus bill. But for another 250,000 disabled vets who have no other income other than their veterans disability benefit and maybe a Social Security disability check, they would get absolutely nothing from the House bill, not one red cent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say that again: The bill proposed by the House and by President Bush would not give a quarter of a million disabled veterans one nickel. That is simply wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the leadership of Senator Baucus, the Senate Finance package corrects that error.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would ensure that the folks who were injured in the cause of defending our freedom are able to get something back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I assure my colleagues that these veterans feel the pinch of higher gas prices, heating costs, and everything else in between, just as much as any other household struggling on a fixed income. The difference is that these folks have worn the colors of our country. They have defended this country. The way we treat those who have fought for our freedom and our Nation says a great deal about our society because when it comes to veterans, we are not talking about a handout, we are talking about a  country honoring our promise we have made to our service men and women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to take a minute to read a letter I received recently from Warren Matte, a veteran from Harlem, MT. Here is what he says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those of us who are combat veterans and poor people, we are now and have been in a recession for a good numbers of years. We are on the bottom rung of the ladder, and it looks like we will always be there. Some of us are surviving on VA benefits and Social Security. The long distances we have to travel here in Montana and the high cost of living is keeping us in poverty. There are 500,000 homeless veterans in this great Nation and no one cares. We put our lives on the line so everyone can  be free and live the good life, and no one cares what happens to us and our families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When our combat veterans are using phrases such as "the bottom rung of the ladder," I think we can do better than that. When disabled veterans worry that "no one cares," we must do better than that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Finance Committee bill is a step in the right direction. So I urge my colleagues, no matter what else you may think of the stimulus package, do not forget about the Warren Mattes of the world. Do not forget about our disabled veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been in this body for a little over 1 year. I can tell my colleagues that from my perspective, the Senate is an easy place to stop things. If you choose, you can stop any piece of legislation from moving forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the House stimulus package is a good stimulus package, but it can be made a whole lot better, and we need to make it a whole lot better. For the 250,000 disabled vets, for the 2.5 million seniors, for those folks who need unemployment benefits, for those folks who need assistance with their heating bills, we need to make it better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not sure this economic stimulus bill will get us out of the economic stresses we feel right now in this country, but I can tell my colleagues one thing: If we don't address the issues that revolve around the people I just talked about--the disabled vets, the seniors, the folks who need help with their heating, the folks who need unemployment benefits--we are making a huge mistake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We ought not to be stopping with this bill. We ought to be making it better in the Senate and passing it on for the President to sign it. We ought to be stamping it with our approval.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
