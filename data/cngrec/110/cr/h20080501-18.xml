  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 1167 and ask for its immediate consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="1167">H. Res. 1167</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative> Resolved, That it shall be in order at any time on the legislative day of Thursday, May 1, 2008, for the Speaker to entertain motions that the House suspend the rules relating to the following measures:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) The bill (<bill type="h" number="5715">H.R. 5715</bill>) to ensure continued availability of access to the Federal student loan program for students and families.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) The bill (<bill type="h" number="493">H.R. 493</bill>) to prohibit discrimination on the basis of genetic information with respect to health insurance and employment.</narrative>
  <narrative> (3) A bill to provide for a temporary extension of programs authorized by the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> The gentlewoman from New York is recognized for 1 hour.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings). All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield myself such time as I may consume and ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on House Resolution 1167.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as the Clerk just described, <bill type="hr" number="1167">H. Res. 1167</bill> authorizes the Speaker to entertain motions that the House suspend the rules at any time on the legislative day of Thursday, May 1, 2008, on legislation relating to the following three measures:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(1) <bill type="h" number="5715">H.R. 5715</bill>, to protect the Federal student loan program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) <bill type="h" number="493">H.R. 493</bill>, Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(3) a bill to provide for a temporary extension of the farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rule is necessary because under clause 1(a) of rule XV, the Speaker may entertain motions to suspend the rules only on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday of each week. In order for suspensions to be considered on other days, the Rules Committee must authorize consideration of these motions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not an unusual procedure. In fact, in the 109th Congress, my friends on the other side of the aisle reported  a number of rules that provided for additional suspension days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This rule limits the suspension of rules to only these three time-sensitive measures. This will help us move these noncontroversial, yet important, legislative initiatives that have widespread bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank the chairwoman of the Rules Committee, Ms. Slaughter, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. HASTINGS of Washington asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on September 28, 2006, the Republicans were in the majority and the Democrats were in the minority. I was managing a rule on the floor similar to what we are considering here today to allow specific bills to be considered under suspensions under the rule on a day that suspensions are not permitted under House rules like today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During debate on that day in September 2006, the then-ranking member of the Rules Committee, Ms. Slaughter, stated, "It isn't just what the Congress has done with its time that is so disappointing. It is also what the Congress has not done, all of the challenges it has not addressed."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the same can be absolutely said today about the Democrat control of the House of Representatives. Earlier this year, House Democrats approved a budget that included a tax hike of $683 billion, the largest in American history. Americans cannot afford the Democrat plans to cut the child tax credit in half, to reinstate the marriage penalty, and raise taxes on every single taxpayer. Instead of record-breaking tax increases, this Congress should work to make those tax cuts permanent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm also dismayed that the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives has not acted to extend the State and local sales tax deduction to States that don't have State income tax. That tax expired on January 1 of this year. The State and local sales tax deduction is important for those States that don't have a State income tax, such as my home State of Washington. Extending this deduction is a matter of fairness that Congress must act to renew as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrat-controlled House of Representatives have also failed to act to give our intelligence community the tools they need to protect our country from new terrorist threats by modernizing the seventies-era FISA laws. For over 74 days now, America has been hobbled in the vital work to monitor terrorist communications and detect new plots despite the fact that the Senate has approved a bipartisan plan and sent it over to the House. House Democrat leaders have refused to allow the House to  vote on the Senate plan and have refused to go to conference with the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, why, I ask, why is an issue of this magnitude being placed on the back burner by Democrat leaders, despite repeated attempts by Republicans to allow the House to vote on this bipartisan plan?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Democrat-controlled House has also failed to address perhaps the most pressing issue on the minds of Americans today, rising gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Democrat leaders may not like to hear it, but since they took control of Congress in January of 2007, the cost of a gallon of gas has gone up by over 50 percent. In fact, the cost of gas has gone up by more in 16 months than it had gone up in the prior 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, they have spent hours giving speeches trying to blame the President and anyone but themselves for the fact that Congress has done nothing to address rising gas prices. But, Madam Speaker, facts are stubborn things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the facts are that gas prices have gone up over a dollar a gallon on the Democrat Congress' watch. The facts are that Democrat leaders promised the American people in 2006 that if they were to control Congress that they had a "commonsense plan" to "lower the price at the pump."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's been 16 months of this Democrat Congress, and the promise is nowhere to be seen. This Congress has put forward no plan, has taken no action, and passed no bills to lower gas prices. They promised relief at the pump to lower gas prices, and they've done nothing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, at this time I would like to insert into the Record an article by Investor's Business Daily posted April 29, 2008, and it states, "This Congress is possibly the most irresponsible in modern history. This is especially true when it comes to America's dysfunctional energy policy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[From Investor's Business Daily, Apr. 29, 2008]</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress Vs. You</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Energy: President Bush let the Democrat-led Congress have it with both barrels Tuesday, lambasting lawmakers for fiddling while the energy crisis burns. It was a well-deserved takedown of do-nothing lawmakers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've said it before, but we'll say it again: This Congress is possibly the most irresponsible in modern history. This is especially true when it comes to America's dysfunctional energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The media won't call either the House or the Senate on its failures, for one very obvious reason: They mostly share an ideology with the Democrats that keeps them from understanding how free markets and supply and demand really work. Sad, but true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we were happy to hear the president do the job, calling out Congress for its inaction and ignorance in his wide-ranging press conference Tuesday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Many Americans are understandably anxious about issues affecting their pocketbook, from gas and food prices to mortgage and tuition bills," Bush said. "They're looking to their elected leaders in Congress for action. Unfortunately, on many of these issues, all they're getting is delay."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Best of all, Bush didn't let the issue sit with just generalities. He reeled off a bill of particulars of congressional energy inaction, including:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Failing to allow drilling in ANWR. We have, as Bush noted, estimated capacity of a million barrels of oil a day from this source alone--enough for 27 million gallons of gas and diesel. But Congress won't touch it, fearful of the clout of the environmental lobby. As a result, you pay at the pump so your representative can raise campaign cash.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Refusing to build new refineries. The U.S. hasn't built one since 1976, yet sanctions at least 15 unique "boutique" fuel blends around the nation. So even the slightest problem at a refinery causes enormous supply problems and price spikes. Congress has done nothing about this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Turning its back on nuclear power. It's safe and, with advances in nuclear reprocessing technology, waste problems have been minimized. Still, we have just 104 nuclear plants--the same as a decade ago--producing just 19% of our total energy. (Many European nations produce 40% or more of their power with nuclear.) Granted, nuclear power plants are expensive--about $3 billion each. But they produce energy at $1.72/kilowatt-hour vs. $2.37 for coal and $6.35 for natural gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Raising taxes on energy producers. This is where a basic understanding of economics would help: Higher taxes and needless regulation lead to less production of a commodity. So by proposing "windfall" and other taxes on energy companies plus tough new rules, Congress makes our energy situation worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are just a few of Congress' sins of omission--all while India, China, Eastern Europe and the Middle East add more than a million barrels of new demand each and every year. New Energy Department forecasts see world oil demand growing 40% by 2030, including a 28% increase in the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans who are worried about the direction of their country, including runaway energy and food prices, should keep in mind the upcoming election isn't just about choosing a new president. We'll also pick a new Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current Congress, led on the House side by a speaker who promised a "common sense plan" to cut energy prices two years ago, has shown itself to be incompetent and irresponsible. It doesn't deserve re-election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we all know that we must work together, Democrats, Republicans, the House, the Senate and the President, to solve America's pain at the pump. Until this happens, however, we should not deny good ideas from being considered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, I will be urging my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that I can amend the rule to make in order any bill that would "have the effect of lowering the national average price per gallon of regular unleaded gas." Let's defeat the previous question and show America that Congress is serious about addressing the rising cost at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I reserve my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, since I will be the last speaker on this side, I will reserve my time until the gentleman has closed.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>At this time, Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Americans don't want a debate on the problems causing gas prices to dramatically increase. They want a debate on solutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, as I stated a moment ago, I will be asking my colleagues to vote "no" on the previous question so that Members can offer solutions that have the effect of lowering the national average price per gallon of regular unleaded gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned, 2 years ago, then-minority leader, now-Speaker Pelosi promised Americans a Democrat plan to lower gas prices at the pump. They have controlled Congress for 16 months, but we still have not seen this plan. Meanwhile, the cost of gasoline is setting record highs. The time is now for the House to debate ideas and solutions for lowering gas prices, and it is time for the Democrats to reveal their plan that they promised 2 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam Speaker, by defeating the previous question, I will move to amend the rule to allow any bill to be offered and considered under suspensions of the rule that would have the effect of lowering the national average price per gallon of regular unleaded gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted in the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that we can have this debate, so that we can consider these vitally important issues that America's families, workers, truckers, small businesses, and our entire economy face with these rising prices of gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, while I had not planned to be here at this point to debate gas prices, I feel compelled to put a few things on the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everybody knows that ExxonMobil announced first quarter profits totaling $11 billion, up 17 percent from last year and just shy of record profits last quarter. BP announced profits increased 63 percent; Royal Dutch-Shell 25 percent, and this increases the 5-year trend of record oil profits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While my colleagues say we have done nothing, the fact is that we've done a great deal and they've almost consistently voted against it. For example, we have tried more than once to take away the Federal subsidies to these oil companies, to the big five, because they are awash in money, and we see no reason for them to get more from the taxpayers than they're already getting at the pump. That has been consistently fought by both the Republican Party and the President. The President calls for  the same policies that he has done all along and sort of hopes for the best. For the last 7 years, congressional Republicans and President Bush doled out billions of dollars in subsidies to the big oil companies, instead of working for an energy independence plan for America which was rarely discussed even during their tenure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're committed to a new direction. Speaker Pelosi has called on President Bush to suspend purchases of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve temporarily. That would go a long way toward helping us with this. We have done this before, but President Bush says he doesn't think it would affect the price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Friday, the New Direction Congress called on the Federal Trade Commission to enforce the law and to investigate record gas prices and possible market manipulation. Under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the FTC has the authority, but will not take it, to exercise the power to protect the consumer from skyrocketing energy costs. That is the Republican administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 also included landmark provisions to make cars and trucks more efficient and to promote the use of more affordable American biofuels. The new fuel standards will reduce our oil consumption by 1.1 million barrels per day by 2020, and it will save American families $700 to $1,000 per year at the pump. That is under the Democrats in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've also passed legislation in this House to crack down on oil price gouging, to hold OPEC accountable for oil price fixing, and then, as I said, to repeal the subsidies for profit-rich Big Oil so we can invest in a renewable energy future. However, President Bush and the Republicans block these efforts every step of the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cracking down on oil price gouging was opposed by 140 Republicans in the House, including all of the Republican leadership except Mr. McCotter. Holding OPEC accountable was opposed by 67 Republicans, including most of the Republican leadership, Mr. Boehner, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Cole, Mr. Dreier, and Ms. Granger. Repealing subsidies to the profit-rich oil companies and investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency was opposed by 174 Republicans,  almost unanimously, including all of the Republican leadership. And in every case, the Bush administration threatened to veto the bills. Unfortunately, Republicans in the Senate refused to even let them become bills to go to the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a good and sufficient record here. We have planned to do more. We have done more than was done in the last 7 years to try to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I urge a "yes" vote on the previous question and on the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings of Washington is as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amendment to <bill type="hr" number="1167">H. Res. 1167</bill> Offered by Mr. Hastings of Washington</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of the resolution, add the following new paragraph:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(4) Any bill which the proponent asserts, if enacted, would have the effect of lowering the national average price per gallon of regular unleaded gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The information contained herein was provided by Democratic Minority on multiple occasions throughout the 109th Congress.)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means </paragraph>
    <paragraph>This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Democratic majority agenda and a vote to allow the opposition, at least for the moment, to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of Representatives, (VI, 308-311) describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as "a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge." To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that "the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the  previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition" in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because the vote today may look bad for the Democratic majority they will say "the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution ..... [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever." But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the definition of the previous question used in the Floor Procedures Manual published by the Rules Committee in the 109th Congress, (page 56). Here's how the Rules  Committee described the rule using information form Congressional Quarterly's "American Congressional Dictionary": "If the previous question is defeated, control of debate shifts to the leading opposition member (usually the minority Floor Manager) who then manages an hour of debate and may offer a germane amendment to the pending business."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled "Amending Special Rules" states: "a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate." (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to  the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools  for those who oppose the Democratic majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.</paragraph>
