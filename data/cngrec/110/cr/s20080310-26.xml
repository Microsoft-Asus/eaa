  <narrative>LOCATING BOB LEVINSON -- (Senate - March 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1816">S1816</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, 1 year ago yesterday, a man who had spent more than 28 years serving the United States of America, a dedicated husband and father and constituent of mine, disappeared from Kish Island, in the Persian Gulf. I rise today to remind this body of the plight of this missing person and the suffering of his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 8, 2007, Bob Levinson, a retired veteran of both the FBI and DEA, arrived in Kish--an Iranian resort island that does not require a visa to visit. From what we know, he checked into his hotel, checked out on March 9th, got into a taxi, and then vanished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have worked closely with the State Department and the Swiss Government to lodge a number of requests for information with the Iranian Government. Unfortunately, Iran claims it has no information on the welfare or whereabouts of Mr. Levinson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last December, Bob's wife Christine traveled to Iran and visited Kish on a factfinding mission. Although she did not find any proof of his whereabouts, she came away with the strong belief that Bob is alive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have worked closely with the administration to try to ascertain what exactly happened to Mr. Levinson. Today, just one day after the anniversary of his disappearance, I ask my colleagues to remember this American citizen, whose whereabouts are still unknown, and to urge the U.S. Government to do everything in its power to locate and bring him home.</paragraph>
