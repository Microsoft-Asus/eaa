  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to highlight an important piece of legislation that was passed by the Senate last night. This legislation would fix a potentially devastating mistake in the agriculture disaster assistance legislation Congress passed last May.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past few years, drought conditions and other natural disasters have financially strained tens of thousands of agriculture producers across the country. Last May, Congress responded to the needs of America's producers by enacting more than $3 billion in emergency disaster assistance for farmers and ranchers who experienced losses in 2005, 2006, and early 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This assistance includes payments for livestock losses under the Livestock Indemnity Program and compensation for grazing losses under the Livestock Compensation Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month, it was brought to my attention that as many as 90% of livestock producers will be ineligible for assistance due to an unintended technicality in the emergency supplemental bill. The USDA's Office of General Counsel is interpreting Section 9012 of the emergency supplemental bill in a very narrow manner. This section requires participation in the Non-Insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program--NAP--or Federal crop insurance pilot program during the year livestock disaster assistance is  requested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If disaster benefits are limited to only those livestock producers with NAP or crop insurance coverage, the vast majority of livestock producers in drought-stricken regions will be ineligible for disaster assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While crop insurance is typically required for crop disaster assistance, similar requirements are highly unusual for livestock disaster assistance. In fact, NAP coverage has never been a prerequisite for livestock disaster assistance in previous emergency spending bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only a small percentage of livestock producers have traditionally participated in the NAP program,  because indemnity payments range from $1 to $2 per acre. Since NAP payments are so low, few grazing producers have participated. It is simply bad policy to exclude producers from disaster assistance who chose not to participate in an ineffective program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress clearly intended disaster assistance to be available to those producers most impacted by years of devastating weather conditions. My legislation would strike Section 9012 of the 2007 emergency supplemental spending bill, and would ensure that livestock producers impacted by natural disasters receive assistance they deserve in a timely manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The USDA is currently preparing policy, procedure and software to implement disaster programs authorized under this legislation. USDA has promised to conduct signup and deliver financial assistance to our agriculture producers this fall. By the time these disaster dollars reach individual producers, many will have waited for over two years since first experiencing weather-related losses. Without this legislative fix, unacceptable disaster program implementation delays will occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the cosponsors of this legislation who have made another strong stand for America's farm and ranch families. I also thank my colleagues in the Senate for recognizing the urgency of this situation and passing this bill by unanimous consent last night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cosponsors of the bill are: Senators NELSON of Nebraska, BAUCUS, TESTER, JOHNSON, CONRAD, HARKIN, LANDRIEU, BARRASSO, ENZI, HAGEL, DORGAN, and Inhofe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the House of Representatives to quickly pass my bill to ensure that livestock producers are able to qualify for the disaster assistance that was signed into law earlier this year.</paragraph>
