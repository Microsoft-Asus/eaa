    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, recently Congress passed House Resolution 590, supporting the goals of Domestic Violence Awareness Month while raising awareness of domestic violence throughout our country. I am here to voice my support for everyone impacted by this horrible nightmare. This is an issue which affects millions in urban and rural areas alike. It crosses economic lines, geographic lines and ethnic lines. No segment of our population is immune. One out of five women and one out  of 14 men have been domestically assaulted at some point in their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of Nebraska, there are more than 5,800 protection orders needed for those living in fear of violence. Domestic violence is an issue which too often is swept under the rug or ignored. So as part of the Domestic Violence Awareness Month, I am wearing a purple ribbon to raise awareness about the crime of domestic abuse as we work toward ending this violence.</paragraph>
