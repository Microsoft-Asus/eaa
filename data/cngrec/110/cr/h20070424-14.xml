  <chair> Pursuant to the order of the House of January 4, 2007, the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Rahall) is recognized during morning hour debates for 4 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="CHAIRWOMAN JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues in the words of mourning and celebration of the life of our late colleague, Juanita Millender-McDonald. She was a leader on many issues as we have heard stated already. And foremost among those in my opinion was her leadership and her vision as the first African American female chairman of a major committee here on Capitol Hill. She had a plan for how this City on a Hill would operate in a more smooth and efficient manner. And while she may not  be with us to see that vision carried out, it is my hope that we will carry it out in memory of her. So to her husband and to her children and to her grandchildren, I hope that her memories will serve as a source of inner strength, inspiration, courage and love for the rest of their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on another subject, if I might, over the last few weeks, a series of anti-coal advertisements sponsored by a group called the Clean Sky Coalition have been running in prominent publications, such as the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and other publications that we in this body come to rely upon each day and view each day. These ads feature photos of people whose faces are smeared with coal dust and the headline reads, "Face It, Coal Is Filthy." Indeed, there have been  bumper sticker handouts on the streets of Washington, DC, stating that same phrase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the real filthy secret here is that the people depicted in these ads are not our Nation's coal miners but they are Hollywood models, and the ads are not being financed by environmental groups as one might be led to believe by the title of Clean Sky Coalition but, rather, these ads are primarily being financed by elements of the natural gas industry, including Chesapeake Energy Corporation headquartered in Oklahoma City. These ads are despicable and so is this so-called Clean Sky Coalition.  The sponsors are not being truthful and they would have you to believe that it is merely environmental groups leading this campaign. The filthy secret is that this ad campaign is about market share. It's about profits. It's about one segment of the energy industry trying to bamboozle the general public and policymakers to sell more of its product.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the filthy secret is that these ads completely ignore the tremendous progress being made to burn coal cleanly and ignore the national security interests of this country. The only truth here is that these ads are an insult, an absolute insult to the hardworking men and women who go beneath this Nation's bowels each and every day to produce the energy that provides for this Nation's electricity.</paragraph>
