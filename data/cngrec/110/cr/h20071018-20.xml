  <narrative>WELCOMING THE HONORABLE NIKI TSONGAS TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11734]</narrative>
  <chair> The Chair recognizes the distinguished dean of the Massachusetts delegation, Mr. Markey.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400253" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on behalf of the entire Massachusetts congressional delegation, it is my great pleasure and privilege to introduce the newest Member of the 110th Congress, the gentlelady from the Fifth Congressional District of Massachusetts, Niki Tsongas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Niki Tsongas is the eldest of four sisters who grew up in a military family bouncing between air bases all across the United States, Europe, and Japan. In 1967, while her father was stationed at the Pentagon, she met her future husband, our late distinguished House colleague, Paul Tsongas, while he was working just across the street as an intern in the office of then Fifth District Congressman Brad Morse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NIKI was Paul's soul mate and his strongest supporter when he ran successfully to join us here in the House of Representatives in January of 1975 and for the Senate in 1978. She was at Paul's side when he ran for the Presidency in 1992 and when he fought so valiantly against the cancer that finally claimed him in 1997.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, NIKI TSONGAS has been a social worker, a community leader in Lowell, a lawyer, and an educator. As a community leader, she has had a passion for social and environmental justice, which she brings with her as she arrives in Congress. And through it all, she was an amazing mother to three daughters, Ashley, Katina and Molly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lowell and the Merrimack Valley has a strong industrial past, and nobody will better represent the roll-up-your-sleeves, hard work persona of this area like NIKI TSONGAS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January, our delegation was proud to cast our votes for the first female Speaker of the House. Today, I am proud to introduce the first female Member of the Massachusetts congressional delegation in 25 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I give you the distinguished gentlelady from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Congresswoman NIKI TSONGAS.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it has been a real honor and pleasure and treasure to be sworn in by the first female House Speaker. Thank you so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to thank ED MARKEY and the members of the delegation who have been so supportive of me as I have journeyed through this most remarkable campaign. It was hard fought, but here we are. Thank you so much for all of the help you provided. It is my great honor to be part of this most remarkable institution. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My race was about a lot of things. But as we approached the end, it was so valuable to me to be able to say that I want to come here and have my first vote cast to be around children's health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is nothing more fundamental to the long-term capacity of this country than to take care of its most vulnerable citizens. And so for me to arrive on this day and cast my vote to override the President's veto is something I will always remember, that I was part of this great debate around the future of our country, the generational responsibility we have both to our young and to our old, and to be here on this most remarkable day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to keep this short. We have a lot of work to do. That is one thing I learned throughout this campaign; people want change. They want us to come to the table, solve problems and move this country forward, and I am happy to be here to be part of that most remarkable opportunity. Thank you.</paragraph>
