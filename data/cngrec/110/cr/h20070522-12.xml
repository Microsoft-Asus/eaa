  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Associated Press reports that the latest Iraq supplemental funding plan incredibly will tie an increase in the minimum wage to funding the war through October. If this is true, and I hope it is not, it tells American workers that the only way they will get an increase in wages is to continue funding a war which is taking the lives of their sons and daughters. First, blood for oil; now a minimum wage for maximum blood? Aren't the American people giving enough blood  for this war without having to give more to have a wage increase? What's happened to our country? We are losing our moral compass. We are losing our sense of justice. We are losing touch with the difference between right and wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do not have to fund this war. We must leave Iraq now. Support our troops. Bring them home. <bill type="h" number="1234">H.R. 1234</bill> is a plan to end the war and stabilize Iraq and give Iraqis control of their oil. We must take a new path. We must take a path of truth and justice.</paragraph>
