  <narrative>THE NAMING OF EMANCIPATION HALL -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13836]</narrative>
  <chair> Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 18, 2007, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Jackson) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400198" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me first begin by expressing my support of a suspension bill that was offered to this body by Mr. Clyburn, Mr. Miller and the ranking minority member on education to help provide emergency funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities that are seeking some bridge loans for construction projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that my remarks today in the 60 minutes that I have been allotted under the Speaker's announced policy are very consistent with the historical concept and circumstances for which that bill will be passed into law and hopefully signed by the President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Mr. Speaker, we have come to this temple of democracy on this momentous occasion to write a new chapter in the unfolding story of human freedom. Today this body passed <bill type="h" number="3315">H.R. 3315</bill>, a bill to name the Visitor Center great hall Emancipation Hall, offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp), and the gentleman from Illinois, myself, Mr. Jackson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The event of emancipation marks one of the most, if not the most significant event in American history, and so too, at least from my perspective, was the passage of this bill. Unfortunately under the rule, it did not afford Members of Congress the opportunity to have a broader discussion about the significance and the importance of this bill. But I do want to take this time to remind the Nation of the importance of this period and to reflect upon it during this Thanksgiving season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Emancipation was more than an act; it was a process. Emancipation was not a date but a period. Emancipation was not an event but the fulfillment of providence that the Arc of history may be long, but it bends towards justice and human freedom. When the American Civil War erupted, both North and South defended their cause as morally just, legally right and constitutionally sound. Northerners and southerners saw themselves as true Americans following in the tradition of the footsteps of the Founding  Fathers. North and South used the Constitution as the source of their moral and their legal authority for conducting a war against the other. Both sides saw themselves as standing in the tradition of the American Revolution. Each side contended that it was fighting for freedom</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Abraham Lincoln, our 16th President's address to the Sanitary Fair in Baltimore on April 18, 1864, summed up the quandary. He said, and I quote, "We all declare for liberty; but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing. With some the word `liberty' may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself and the product of his labor, while with others, the same word may mean for some men to do as they please with other men and the product of other men's labor. Here are  two not only different but incompatible things, called by the same name, `liberty.' And it follows that each of these things is, by their respective parties," President Lincoln goes on to say, "called by two different and incompatible names, `liberty' and `tyranny.' "</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He then went on to say, "The shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep's throat, for which the sheep thanks the shepherd as a liberator, while the wolf denounces him for the same act as the destroyer of liberty, especially as the sheep was a black one. Plainly the sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon the definition of the word `liberty'; and precisely the same difference prevails today among us human creatures, even in the North, and all profess to love liberty."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, women, lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgendered Americans, African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans and students see in the word "liberty" one thing. Today for the Titans of Industry, it still means quite another. For the dispossessed, it means for each person to do with himself as they please. For the Titans it means for them to do as they please with other men and the product of their labor anywhere in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Lincoln said, "And it follows that each of the things is, by the respective parties, called by two different and incompatible names, `liberty' and `tyranny.' "</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why efforts to name the great hall Liberty Hall will settle for some but still not settle for others the fundamental question of human freedom in the American historical context. For millions of Americans to pass through Emancipation Hall and not Liberty Hall is an important acknowledgment about the process for attaining human freedom in our context as Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lincoln understood for his time and ours that we must not be confused about the language and the process of human freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Much has been said about Lincoln and his ambivalence about emancipation. I believe when placed in the greater context, clarity emerges in Lincoln's calculation of emancipation. In 1862, Lincoln's announced support of colonization, along with his lack of public support for emancipation, was generating sometimes vicious attacks from militant abolitionists, including a "Prayer for 20 Millions" editorial urging emancipation that appeared in Horace Greeley's New York Tribune. On August 22, a month  after the private announcement to his Cabinet on July 22 that he intended to issue an Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln replied to Greeley's editorial with a masterfully written open letter. Here's what our 16th President had to say:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"If there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount objective in this struggle is to save the Union, and it is either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing a single slave, I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all of the slaves, I would do  it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forebear, I forebear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lincoln was reiterating his central thesis, that the purpose of the war was preservation of the Union, but in light of the intransigence of the border States, he was publicly hinting that he might have to do something more, including emancipation to save the Union. In this open letter, Lincoln was saying "if," but he had already concluded in his mind "that" the only way to save the Union was to free the slaves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the emancipation proposal became public, President Lincoln sometimes was ridiculed in public political oratory and newspaper editorials about his Emancipation Proclamation, which would free the slaves only where the President had no power to do so, those States in rebellion, but he preserved the institution of slavery everywhere he did have the power, those border States that chose to stay in the Union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Lincoln's enemies either misunderstood the President, lacked the understanding of the Constitution, or ignored his politics. On saving the Union, Lincoln had additional flexibility under the Constitution. Politically, he could sometimes get away with violating it by engaging in arbitrary arrests and suspending the writ of habeas corpus. On the question of ending slavery, however, Lincoln saw no such flexibility. His understanding of the Constitution committed him to acting within both it  and the law, for neither had yet been changed. Under the Constitution, slavery was still legal in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the first question, Lincoln and all Republicans of that era agreed that a 13th amendment outlawing slavery must be added to the Constitution. The Senate quickly passed such an amendment; but the House, which had gained 34 Democrats in the 1862 mid-term elections, was opposed. Lincoln understood, if others didn't, that issuing the Emancipation Proclamation would convert a struggling Union Army, trying to hold a Nation together, into an army of liberation to free the slaves. The newly freed  slaves could help win the struggle by fighting along the Union forces and soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, the liberation of the slaves would only happen, and only happen if the North won the war. Militant abolitionists still thought the proclamation weak; Southerners thought it an outrage, but most antislavery advocates, both black and white, understood its revolutionary implications. It was the one act that changed the entire character of the war. It gave the war a moral purpose, human freedom, to bolster the political goal of saving the Union, and a purpose with such deep emotional power  condemned the Confederacy to sure defeat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question now was, having transformed the conflict into a war of liberation, would the Northern soldiers still fight? Some said no. "An Ohio Democrat amended the party's slogan to proclaim, `the Constitution as it is, the Union as it was, the N-I-G-G-E-R-S where they are.' " But most said yes. "A Democratic private in the Army of the Potomac whose previous letters railed against abolitionists and blacks now expressed support for putting away any institution if by doing so it will put down  the rebellion, for I hold that nothing should stand in the way of the Union, the N-I-G-G-E-R-S, nor anything else."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the July 4, 1863, victory at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, Northern hopes rose and Southern spirits sank. The burial at Gettysburg nearly 144 years ago this month was originally planned for October 23, but rescheduled to November 19 because the principal orator, Edward Everett of Massachusetts, could not be ready before then. Lincoln, by comparison was casually invited to attend and make a few remarks. "No insult was intended. Federal responsibility or participation was not assumed then in  State activities. Lincoln took no offense. Though specifically invited to deliver only `a few appropriate remarks' to open the cemetery, he meant to use this opportunity. The partly mythical victory at Gettysburg was important to his administration's war propaganda."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are mythical accounts that Lincoln wrote his Gettysburg Address on the back of an envelope. Even though the 272-word speech probably took less than 3 minutes to deliver, interrupted with applause five times by 20,000 in attendance, such cavalier preparation would have been totally uncharacteristic of President Lincoln, who took such opportunities seriously and chose his words very carefully.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lincoln intended to use this occasion and this speech to lift the Nation's eyes above the death and the carnage of Gettysburg "to a level of abstraction that purges it of grosser matter." Lincoln did for the whole Civil War what he accomplished for the single battlefield." He transformed its meaning and, in doing so, transformed what it meant to be an American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lincoln mentioned neither slavery nor Gettysburg in the Gettysburg address. He drained his speech of all of the particulars in order to lift up an ideal. Lincoln intended to create something good and new out of this tragic and bloody episode. Both North and South strove to interpret Gettysburg to further their own war interests. Lincoln was after an even bigger victory, winning the ideological as well as the military war, and I believe he succeeded. The Civil War today is, to most Americans,  what Lincoln wanted it to mean. Words had to complete the work of the guns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is it that President Lincoln had to say on that occasion? He said: "Four score and seven years ago," and this is a 3 1/2  minute speech. In fact, Martin Luther King delivered the "I have a dream speech" in about 13 1/2  minutes. So my thinking is anytime someone speaks, they should speak between 3 1/2  minutes and 13 minutes. If they give a speech longer than that, well, they are really giving history a fit. Also, if you can't say it between Gettysburg and "I have a dream," it probably  shouldn't be said at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let's see what Lincoln had to say at Gettysburg, 3 1/2  minutes: "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent," November 19, 1863, right around the time we are trying to break for Thanksgiving, 144th anniversary, and let's reflect, 144 years ago. "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new Nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great Civil  War testing whether that Nation, or any Nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those here who gave their lives that the Nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this." I love this part: "But, in a larger sense,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"It is for us the living, rather, to be here dedicated to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus so far nobly advanced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us ..... that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain ..... that this Nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we wave the flag and celebrate on July 4, Independence Day, we are not so much celebrating our American-ness in terms of our independence from England. We are celebrating the meaning of the flag and America as Lincoln interpreted them in his Gettysburg Address, because July 4, 1776, only white males could vote, and then they had to be landowners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On July 4, 1863, with the Northern victory at Gettysburg and the Northern victory at Vicksburg, Abraham Lincoln saw an opportunity to reinterpret what July 4 would mean for the future. So when we barbecue on July 4, and when we celebrate our Independence Day, when we look at Hillary Clinton running for President; Barack Obama; Mitt Romney, a Mormon running for President, none of this was possible on July 4, 1776. An African American running for President on July 4, 1776, was a different America.  A woman running for President on July 4, 1776, was a different America. Barack Obama running for President, Mitt Romney, a Mormon running for President on July 4, 1776, a different America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Abraham Lincoln says this July 4, 1863, is going to yield a new birth of freedom for all Americans and we will never look at July 4 again because July 4 will never be the July 4 that it used to be because we are en route to being a different America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At Gettysburg, Lincoln reinterpreted the Constitution. Looking past slavery  in the Constitution, he appealed to the Declaration of Independence and its claim that all men are created equal. Conservative political heirs to this outrage still attack Lincoln for subverting the Constitution at Gettysburg.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's see what Garry Wills had to say about this. He said that Lincoln is here not only to sweeten the air at Gettysburg but to clear the infected atmosphere of American history itself, tainted with official sins and inherited guilt. He would cleanse the Constitution, not as William Lloyd Garrison had, by burning an instrument that countenanced slavery. He altered the document from within, by an appeal from its letter to the spirit, subtly changing the recalcitrant stuff that legal compromise,  bringing it to its own indictment. By implicitly doing this, he performed one of the most daring acts of open-air sleight-of-hand ever witnessed by the unsuspecting. Everyone in that vast throng of 20,000 people who heard Abraham Lincoln on that day had their intellectual pocket picked. The crowd departed with a new thing in its ideological luggage,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lincoln's Gettysburg Address was transforming the United States of America from a plural to a singular noun, from the United States "are" into the United States "is" a free government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>According to Gary Wills, Lincoln, by his words and his actions, converted the Union from a mystical hope into a constitutional reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Looking out over the extraordinary events of 1863, on October 3, 1863, realizing that the North had made substantial progress in Gettysburg and substantial progress in Vicksburg, and Robert E. Lee, the Democrats, troops were on the retreat throughout the South, and he saw an opportunity to make an extraordinary period for which all of us are grateful even to this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On October 3, 1863, Abraham Lincoln issued the following, Mr. Speaker, proclamation:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"By the President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"A proclamation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The year that is drawing towards its close," and I quote, "has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God. In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude  and severity, which has sometimes seemed to foreign states to invite and promote their aggression, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except the theater of military conflict; while that theater has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union. Needful diversions of wealth and strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defense have not arrested the plow, the shuttle or the ship. The ax has enlarged the boarders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals have yielded," this is in spite of a civil war, they have "yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camps, the siege and the battlefield; and the country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect continuance of years with large increase of freedom. No human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"In testimony whereof, I have heretofore set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Done at the City of Washington, this Third day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States the Eighty-eighth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"By the President: Abraham Lincoln."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanksgiving has nothing to do with the Pilgrims and the Native Americans. Thanksgiving is looking out over a national disaster, a war over Federalism between the big government in Washington and the States and the fact that the slaves had been freed and the Northern armies were in pursuit through Vicksburg and Gettysburg, and Abraham Lincoln said the Nation is going to be preserved. And we deserve to give the person who is responsible for its preservation the greatest thanks, God, and therefore  every third Thursday in November is set aside as a national day of thanks to remember the path that we took to save the Union. That is what Abraham Lincoln was after.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I haven't quite figured out yet why national memory has bypassed this event and decided to somehow ascribe it to events that have absolutely nothing to do with Abraham Lincoln's proclamation. The very first Thanksgiving was about the Civil War and about emancipation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The same can be said for the story of our Capitol. From the moment a visitor enters this building, the unfolding process of emancipation, the players in the drama, the actors, the people, the heroes. The "sheroes" have been hidden. They have been denied a fair and accurate account of these unfolding events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you enter the Capitol Rotunda, we look up at the ceiling and we see the story of America, from Columbus all the way around the Rotunda to the Wright Brothers, from Columbus to the Wright Brothers, and not a single African American in the Rotunda's mural of the story of America. From Columbus to the Wright Brothers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Statuary Hall, the Old House Chamber, emancipation is ignored in Statuary Hall, where there today are status of the honored dead of the Confederacy. President Jefferson Davis is there, the greatest traitor in American history. Confederate Vice President Alexander Hamilton Stephens has his statue there. Confederate General Robert E. Lee is there, in uniform. Confederate Commander Joseph Wheeler is there, in uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that room, Old Statuary Hall, is where States were admitted to the Union, one free and one slave, to keep the balance between the North and the South, so that the House of Representatives and the Senate would never have more Members than any regional faction of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet for the millions of visitors, Mr. Speaker, who come through our Statuary Hall, we never tell them that story. We would rather talk to the floor and show them that the Chamber has acoustic capabilities that allow us to talk to the floor and watch our voices bounce off the ceiling and arrive somehow on the other side of the room.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Old Senate Chamber, Charles Sumner got beaten half to death by Preston Brooks, and a book still sits on Charles Sumner's desk, the central story in the Old Senate Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Old Senate Chamber doubled as the Supreme Court Chamber while the Supreme Court was under construction. It was in the Old Senate Chamber that Plessy v. Ferguson was decided, the Old Supreme Court Chamber. Of all of the decisions made in that room, it is known for two decisions under Justice Taney's leadership: Dred Scott and the Amistad Africans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So whether it is the Rotunda, from Columbus to the Wright Brothers; whether it is Old Statuary Hall where people visit our Capitol and are taught about the acoustics of the building and not about how States were admitted to the Union to keep the balance between North and South or why all the Confederate generals have their statues in Statuary Hall; whether it is the Old Senate Chamber, Charles Sumner getting beaten, caned half to death by Preston Brooks and the Plessy v. Ferguson decision; or  whether it is the Old Supreme Court Chamber, where Dred Scott and the Amistad Africans, Joseph Cinque and the others, were told they could go back home, only parts of the story are told, when they are told.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is the emancipation process, process, process, not an event, not a date, not a time, it is the emancipation process that led to the 13th, the 14th, and the 15th Amendments to the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as descendants of slaves, we believe that as Americans are better educated on this history, that that process, that American process, that process that we cannot change, it is part of our history, as more Americans are educated about that process, that it will lead to our 28th Amendment, our 29th Amendment, our 30th Amendment: health care for all, education of equal high quality for all, a cleaner environment for all, fixing our Nation's voting system for all, providing equality for all people,  especially women. It is our Nation's historical process, and only that process that can provide emancipation for all. Not liberty. Emancipation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, interpreting Lincoln's work and his life is extremely important. Recently there have been questions raised as to whether Lincoln should be credited with freeing the slaves. The argument goes, given some of Lincoln's history, his racial attitudes and statements, his moderate views on the subject, his noninterference with slavery where it already existed, his one proposed solution of colonization, his gradualist approach to ending the institution, his hesitancy with respect to issuing  the emancipation and using colored troops in the war, his late conversion to voting rights for blacks and more, why should he be given credit for freeing the slaves?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some have even argued that it was the various actions taken by the slaves themselves, including the power given to the Union causes as a result of the moral calls for overturning slavery, plus the actual military role of working and fighting in Union campaigns that actually freed them. By forcing the emancipation issue on to the agenda, first of military officers, then of Congress, and finally of Lincoln, it was their actions that led to freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, just as Congress and Lyndon Johnson would not have been able to sign the civil rights legislation of the 1960s apart from a modern civil rights and human rights movement, so too the military commanders, the Congress and Lincoln, would not have been able to achieve what they did without agitation and movement from the slaves and their allies. On the other hand, the slaves would not have become freed men, apart from what these leaders did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because historical interpretation has played up the role of white male leaders, while playing down the role of mass movement and leaders of color and women, our understanding of history has been skewed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the current putdown of traditional historical interpretation is legitimate rejection and reaction to this past limited and distorted understanding and interpretation of our history. The search now, it seems to me, should be for more balanced interpretation, which includes striving to put many forces and multiple players into proper balance and perspective. That, I think, is what is at issue with regard to the question that did Lincoln free the slaves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, but for Abraham Lincoln and the answers for which he so nobly fought and advanced, we today would be without the capacity of building a more perfect Union for all Americans. The naming of Emancipation Hall is an extraordinary event on behalf of all Americans. We begin the process now of broadening the education of all Americans to make the Union more perfect for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would close, Mr. Speaker, by just saying this: I shall never forget the movie "Roots." There was a great scene in the movie "Roots" when Kunta Kinte was being told by a slave master that his name was Toby. And he kept saying no, my name is Kunta Kinte. And he said, no, your name is Toby. He said Kunta Kinte. Toby.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Kinte made an extraordinary contribution to saving this Union, to preserving it, and his descendants are making a contribution and making it more perfect. Congratulations to all Members of Congress today who voted to name the great hall Emancipation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
