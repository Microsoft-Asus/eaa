    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am proud to honor a group of 88 World War II veterans from every region of Louisiana who are traveling to Washington, DC, this weekend to visit the various memorials and monuments that recognize the sacrifices of our Nation's invaluable service members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Louisiana HonorAir, a group based in Lafayette, LA, is sponsoring this Saturday's trip to the Nation's Capital. The organization is honoring each surviving World War II Louisiana veteran by giving them an opportunity to see the memorials dedicated to their service. On this trip, the veterans will visit the World War II, Korea, Vietnam and Iwo Jima memorials. They will also travel to Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknowns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the first of four flights Louisiana HonorAir will make to Washington, DC, this fall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>World War II was one of America's greatest triumphs, but was also a conflict rife with individual sacrifice and tragedy. More than 60 million people worldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians, and more than 400,000 American service members were slain during the long war. The ultimate victory over enemies in the Pacific and in Europe is a testament to the valor of American soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. The years 1941 to 1945 also witnessed an unprecedented mobilization of domestic  industry, which supplied our military on two distant fronts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Louisiana, there remain today more than 33,000 living WWII veterans, and each one has a heroic tale of achieving the noble victory of freedom over tyranny. The oldest in this HonorAir group was born in 1913. Two of these veterans began their service in the Louisiana National Guard as early as 1936, and were activated for Federal service in 1941.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This group served in every branch of the military, including 29 in the U.S. Army, 14 in the U.S. Army Air Corps, 23 in the U.S. Navy, 8 in the U.S. Marine Corps, 2 in the U.S. Merchant Marines, one in the U.S. Coast Guard and one in the Women's Reserve of the U.S. Naval Reserve. Our heroes served across the globe, participating in major invasions such as the Battle of the Bulge, the Battle of Huertgen Forest, and the battles of Tunisia, Naples-Foggia, Rome, Anzio, Po Valley and North Apennines.  They served in Europe, North Africa and the Pacific Theater. One was wounded in Germany, and another was captured as a prisoner of war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of these veterans earned Purple Hearts, including one with three Battle Stars. One of our veterans went on to serve in both Korea and Vietnam, retiring in 1967.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the Senate to join me in honoring these 88 veterans, all Louisiana heroes, who we welcome to Washington this weekend and Louisiana HonorAir for making these trips a reality.</paragraph>
