  <narrative>HONORING SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD -- (Senate - November 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14596">S14596</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, last night I had the honor and pleasure of going to a birthday party. I, personally, never had birthday parties. My mother always said my birthday was too close to Christmas, so I guess we made up for it on Christmas. But the party last night was sensational.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hundreds of people showed up. They showed up a few days early, but only a few days, because this coming week Senator Robert Byrd will be 90 years old. He holds all kinds of records. I often compare him with the greatest baseball player of all time, Babe Ruth, for obvious reasons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What a pleasure it has been for me to serve in the Senate, but every day that goes by that I am able to serve in the Senate, I reflect upon how fortunate I am to serve with Senator Byrd and the many courtesies he has extended to me; from the first time I arrived in the Senate, when he asked: Senator, will you agree to conduct hearings for the Interior Subcommittee on Appropriations?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was as good as scoring a touchdown, to have Senator Byrd ask me to conduct a hearing. He was chairman of that subcommittee, and I did that. When work was to be done on that committee, it didn't matter what I had scheduled, I set it aside so I could satisfy Senator Byrd and do a good job of conducting those hearings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish Senator Byrd happy birthday. As I said last night at the birthday party, I also wish to tell him how much I appreciate all he has done for me personally, all he has done for the people of West Virginia, all he has done for the people of the State of Nevada, and all he has done for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is such a thought-provoking thing, to think that I have been able to serve with Senator Byrd and serve in some of the positions he has held: Minority leader, majority leader, minority whip, majority whip.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night I was so happy. Senator Byrd was his old self. There he was up there in front of everybody, without a note, reciting poetry from memory. I have said it before, but I will say it again, I want him to hear this and I want everyone else to hear this. I have a lot of favored stories about Senator Byrd, but this is my favorite.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I came back from Nevada. I was right back here. Senator Byrd said: What did you do this weekend?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said: Senator Byrd, I grabbed a little paperback book out of my library and I read "The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Byrd did as I have seen him do many times: Robinson Crusoe? He was on that island 28 years, 6 months, 2 weeks, and 3 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I looked at him. I said: What is he talking about? I just read the book. I went back to my home and looked, and there it was. He hadn't read the book for 40 years, but in that computer he has that is a brain, he was able to recall that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is only one indication of the abilities of this orphan who is so proud of being from West Virginia. He may have been an orphan growing up, but he is not an orphan in the Senate. He has a family who loves him.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, when Robert C. Byrd was born, America had just sent its first troops to France, an angry mob had just abolished private property in Russia, and the New York Times published its first op-ed piece.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the "Times" would continue to publish daily editorials in addition to those op-eds. But fortunately for the country and for us, his colleagues, the Lord granted Robert Carlyle Byrd the gift of years--a lot of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week, Senator Byrd celebrates one more milestone in a long and growing list of them: his 90th birthday. And I think I speak for every Member of this body when I say we are grateful to have lived in an age in which we could serve with such a remarkable man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Writing about the foundation of any great society, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Robert Byrd is such a man. Indeed, those words seem almost to have been written with him in mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator, we revere you for your many achievements, we thank you for always bringing us back to our purpose here, we wish you a very happy birthday, and many more to come.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Oklahoma.</chair>
