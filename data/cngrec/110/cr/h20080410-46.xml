  <narrative>MAJOR ISSUES AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE DEMANDING CONGRESS ADDRESS -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2211]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is now 5:10 p.m. on a Thursday afternoon. And for most individuals across this Nation, this is about the end of the fourth working day of the week. For the House, we've just completed less than two full days of work, but if you stretch it, it's really a little over two. Where's the House now? They've gone home. Where was the House on Monday? Home. Now, that's important because there are important things to do at home. But Madam Speaker, it's important to  appreciate that there are major issues that the American people are demanding that Congress address.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We heard about one of them this afternoon: Gas prices. Gas prices significantly increased over the last 12 to 15 months, and this Congress has done nothing except raise taxes on American oil producers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the reason I want to bring focus to the issue of Congress going home is that we are now 55 days into a unilateral disarmament for our Nation. That is right, Madam Speaker. Fifty-five days ago, this House, the leadership in the House, chose to allow some amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to expire. Now, what did those amendments do? Those amendments which were adopted shortly after 9/11 allowed, e-d, past tense, allowed our intelligence community to listen or surveil  or intercept phone or electronic communication between, Madam Speaker, between a foreign individual in a foreign land talking or communicating to a foreign individual in a foreign land. That is right, Madam Speaker. If an individual who wishes to do our Nation harm</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now why did they choose to let that expire? Well, what they believe is that American trial lawyers ought to have the ability to sue communications companies who share that information with the United States government, with our intelligence community, the folks trying to keep us safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, back in my district, the Sixth District of Georgia, the people don't understand the kind of leadership that would have the mentality to not allow our intelligence community to listen to a potential terrorist talking to another potential terrorist outside the United States. Not to an American, but to somebody who is not an American citizen. Consequently, Madam Speaker, we are now utilizing the same rules that we had in effect on September 10, 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, you hear a lot of talk about crises across this Nation, and our friends on the other side of the aisle talk about the crisis in this and the crisis in that. I'll tell you what we've got a crisis of in this Congress, Madam Speaker, and that is a Congress of irresponsibility, a crisis of irresponsibility and a leadership that refuses to allow this Congress to do its number one job, which is to protect our citizens and our constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I call on the Speaker and I call on the majority leader and I call on the majority party in the House of Representatives to bring the Protect America Act to the floor. It's a bill that has bipartisan support. A majority of individuals in the House have said they will support it. It would pass if it were brought up today. But what were we talking about today? Bills that didn't have to do with the security of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the Speaker and the majority leader to bring that bill to the floor, allow it to pass as it has in the Senate, in a bipartisan way, so that we can return home and tell our constituents that we acted positively to assist in protecting them and their families.</paragraph>
