    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today is National Ride Your Motorcycle to Work Day, and just a few minutes ago, I proudly rode a Harley Davidson Roadking to the steps of the Capitol building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Motorcycle riding has been a passion of mine for many years, since my 20th birthday, and a proud member of the American Motorcyclist Association I am, as well as the Harley Owners Group. I can attest that responsible riding has many unique recreational benefits for millions of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this session of Congress, we are looking for ways to break our dependence on foreign oil, develop alternative fuels, and increase domestic conservation. Motorcycles are excellent alternatives to current forms of transportation because they offer both fuel efficiency and greater enjoyment for the commuter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage all Americans to learn more about the recreational and environmental benefits of responsible motorcycle riding by visiting American Motorcyclist Association's Web site and availing themselves of the motorcycle rider safety training program.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
