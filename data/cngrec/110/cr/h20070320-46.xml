    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in observance of the 186th anniversary of Greek independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1821 when Greek patriots revolted against their Ottoman oppressors, they sounded a clarion call for liberty that was heard by freedom-loving men and women all over Europe and around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 25 we celebrate a courageous struggle for independence that spanned 8 long and hard-fought years, creating a foundation for the modern Greek state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans and Greeks have long shared a profound commitment to the principles of democracy, and both peoples have worked to create societies built upon these values. Throughout history each nation has taken inspiration from the other's experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1823 Greek patriot, intellectual, and physician Adamantios Koraes wrote one of many letters to his friend Thomas Jefferson seeking counsel on how to draw up a constitution for Greece to use upon its liberation. Jefferson wrote extensively in response, expounding the virtues and the fundamentals of the freedoms we cherish today: freedom of religion; freedom of person, habeas corpus; trial by jury; the exclusive right of legislation and taxation reserved to the representatives of the people;  and freedom of the press. Greek Independence Day marks the moment the people of Greece realized these freedoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A shared commitment to liberty has been the hallmark of our collective histories. In the two world wars, Greece fought heroically in the allied campaign to maintain liberty and democracy. Similarly, during the Cold War, Greece fought against totalitarian aggression and emerged as a democratic nation with a vigorous economy, a strong partner in the United States, and a full member of both NATO and the European Union. Most recently, Greece's tremendous performance as host to the 2004 Olympic Games  has shone a light on what this longstanding commitment to democratic values and institutions can yield.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this occasion also offers us an opportunity to reflect on the enormous and distinctive contributions that Greek Americans have made to every aspect of life in our Nation, including the arts, business, science, public service, and scholarship. As Greek Americans have made this remarkable progress, they have also preserved important traditional values of hard work, education, and commitment to family and church, principles that strengthen and invigorate our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In one of his letters to Koraes, Jefferson wrote this: "Possessing ourselves the combined blessings of liberty and order, we wish the same to other countries and to none more than yours, which, the first of civilizations, provided examples of what man should be."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In America and Greece we choose this day to celebrate the courage, the liberty, and democracy that is the foundation of every civilized society.</paragraph>
