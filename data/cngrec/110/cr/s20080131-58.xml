  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on Monday, the Senate will resume consideration of the FISA legislation, and at 5:30 p.m., the Senate will proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="5140">H.R. 5140</bill>, the Economic Stimulus bill. Senators should be aware that additional votes will occur following the 5:30 cloture vote. Those votes would be in relation to the FISA legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand there may be some problems with Republicans wanting any votes that afternoon, but we will work on that Monday. At least we have agreement on this legislation, and I see no reason, if we can't take a big chunk out of it on Monday, which I think we can, we can finish it on Tuesday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank everybody for all their good work this week.</paragraph>
