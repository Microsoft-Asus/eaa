  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in January I introduced a bill to make permanent the $10,000 adoption tax credit which is set to expire in 2010. Four months later this bill has garnered 125 bipartisan cosponsors, including Ways and Means Committee Chairman CHARLES RANGEL.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the grateful father of an adopted son and a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I know all too well the challenges and rewards adoption brings. The adoption process can be mentally and physically exhausting. Families should not be overwhelmed with the financial burdens as well. We should offer incentives, not penalties, for making this commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee to move forward with this legislation and make the dream of a family a permanent reality by promoting adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
