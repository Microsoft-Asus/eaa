  <speaking speaker="300022" topic="Introducing S. 2877. A bill to improve and enhance research and programs on cancer survivorship, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2877">S. 2877</bill>] Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Pediatric, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancer Survivorship and Quality of Life Act, legislation introduced on the House side by Representatives SOLIS and BONO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Cancer Institute estimates that there are more than 10 million cancer survivors in the United States. Advances in medical research have resulted in earlier diagnoses, more effective treatments, and improvements in medical outcomes for Americans with cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These advances in cancer care are especially evident when examining our gains for pediatric cancers. The 5-year survival rate for children with cancer has improved markedly over the past decades, from 56 percent for those diagnosed in the mid-1970s to 79 percent for those diagnosed between 1995 and 2000. There are now more than 270,000 childhood cancer survivors in the U.S., and that number is expected to increase as we gain a better understanding of pediatric cancers and ways to treat them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in the years that we have made these gains in addressing cancer in children, we have also learned that many of these survivors experience what are known as "late effects" resulting from either the cancer or its treatment. These late effects include things like additional cancers, osteoporosis, heart problems and reduced lung capacity. As many as a quarter of childhood cancer survivors experience late effects that are serious or life-threatening. We must be doing more to ensure that the  quality of life of children who have survived cancer is as high as possible, and that life-saving treatments result in as few long-term side effects as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also important to note that health care disparities also impact pediatric cancer care and survivorship. African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asian/Pacific Islander children have  higher rates of certain cancers than their white counterparts. In addition, due to disparities in access to care, these individuals may fail to receive adequate treatments for late effects of cancers. We need to improve our efforts to ensure that racial and ethnic disparities  are eliminated from cancer care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a 2005 report, titled "From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition", the Institute of Medicine, IOM, recommended several measures we can take as a nation to improve the quality of life for children and young adults who are impacted by cancer. The legislation that I am introducing today will allow us to implement some of those recommendations, including expansion of cancer control and surveillance programs, increasing research in survivorship, and developing model systems of  care and monitoring for cancer survivors. It will also create grants to establish childhood cancer survivorship clinics, and help childhood cancer organizations expand and improve their work in providing care and treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure that we address the needs of cancer survivors throughout the lifespan, and help to improve the quality of life for the many children and families that struggle with a cancer diagnosis.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="Introducing S. 2879. A bill to provide for orderly and balanced development of energy resources within the Roan Plateau Planning Area of Colorado, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2879">S. 2879</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to ensure responsible development of the energy resources under Colorado's Roan Plateau in a manner that minimizes the adverse impacts on its unique ecological resources while maximizing the financial returns to the State of Colorado and to our country. This legislation was developed jointly with my colleagues Representative John Salazar and Representative Mark Udall, who plan to introduce the legislation today  in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Roan Plateau, an area of pristine wilderness in northwestern Colorado, rises 3,500 feet out of the Colorado River Valley. It boasts native cutthroat trout streams and has some of the best winter elk and mule deer habitat left in the heavily developed Piceance Basin. The Roan has long been a favorite destination for hunters and anglers. The mule deer, elk, black bear, and native trout that find habitat on top and at the base of the Roan Plateau are an economic engine all their own, drawing  tourism and recreation dollars to towns like Glenwood Springs, Rifle, Silt, and Parachute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently the Department of Interior's Bureau of Land Management, which oversees the public lands on the Roan and the minerals beneath them, announced that it is opening these lands for energy development. Under the BLM plan, 67,000 acres of public lands on and around the Roan Plateau will be open for natural gas drilling as soon as this year. We in Colorado are blessed to be home to significant energy resources, and tapping these resources is important to sustain our Nation's energy needs and  invigorate the Colorado State economy. But in its current form, the BLM plan lacks adequate protections for the Roan's land, water, and wildlife--the very things that support the outfitters, guides, hotels and restaurants in the area. And by proposing to lease all of the undeveloped public lands at once, the BLM plan would sell Colorado short.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Drilling is already happening on roughly half of the plateau that is either owned or leased by the natural gas industry. Without question, western Colorado is experiencing a boom in energy development. During the decade of the 1990s, the average number of completed gas wells per year in Garfield County--the home of the Roan--was 80. The number of completed wells has climbed rapidly since 2000, setting a new high each year. In 2006, 840 new wells were completed in Garfield County. This rapid expansion  of activity has created new jobs in the region, but has also stoked new conflicts between the energy values and environmental, ecological, and recreation values of these lands. The impacts of this development are being felt by landowners and outdoor enthusiasts alike. Sportsmen have watched as public hunting areas, habitat, and important watersheds have been irreparably degraded as a result of widespread development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this level of development occurring we must ensure that the most pristine areas of the plateau that remain are protected, that oil and gas development in the region occurs with minimal disturbance, and that Colorado receives the best possible financial return on any oil and gas leases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation has three main functions that work to address these issues. First, it requires phased leasing on top of the plateau to maximize state revenues and better protect wildlife habitat and the environment. Second, it ensures protection of critical cutthroat trout watersheds and other wildlife habitat on top and around the base of the Roan Plateau. Lastly, it contains a conforming amendment to the Transfer Act to ensure that Colorado receives its fair share of leasing revenues rather  than directing this money, as the Transfer Act specifies, to the Anvil Points cleanup fund, which is in surplus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The phased leasing provision requires BLM to lease less sensitive areas outside of cutthroat trout watersheds first, rather than leasing all available development areas at once. In selecting areas for leasing, BLM must take into consideration various factors designed to maximize leasing revenues and to minimize the environmental and ecological impacts of development. Phased leasing will generate higher per-lease bids from industry--and more money for the Treasury and Colorado--than the current  BLM plan to lease the entire designated development areas at once.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The special protection provisions of the bill expand BLM's designated "Areas of Critical Environmental Concern," ACECs, to include the headwaters of Northwater Creek and the East Fork of Parachute Creek above the confluence with First Anvil Creek--both of which are critical native cutthroat trout watersheds. The bill also permits gas development activities on top of the plateau outside ACECs that are within development corridors along existing ridge-top roads on slopes not exceeding 20 percent.  These measures will protect critical elk and mule deer habitat around the base of the plateau, while allowing development and recovery of the available natural gas under the Roan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1907, President Teddy Roosevelt told a crowd that, "In utilizing and conserving the natural resources of the Nation the one characteristic more essential than any other is foresight. The conservation of our natural resources and their proper use constitute the fundamental problem which underlies almost every other problem of our national life." President Roosevelt's wisdom--over a century later--is as valuable as ever to a Nation committed to protecting its land and water, but that is in  dire need of affordable, domestic sources of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Roan is a special place. Protecting our State's last few remaining wild spaces, maximizing oil and gas leasing revenues from these areas and supporting the communities that surround them need not be at odds. This bill will replace BLM's plan with a better, more balanced approach that will protect the most critical areas on the top of the Roan and provide the most benefit to the State of Colorado.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="Introducing S. 2881. A bill to establish national standards for discharges from cruise vessels into the waters of the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2881">S. 2881</bill>] Mr. President, if I said there was an industry that generates millions of gallons of wastewater every day and that can dump that waste with virtually no oversight, you might think that I was recalling the days before the Clean Water Act. The truth is, though, that such an industry exists today. I am talking about cruise ships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am introducing the Clean Cruise Ship Act of 2008. This bill will require cruise ships to upgrade their wastewater treatment systems to meet the standards of today's best available technology, which has been shown to significantly reduce the amount of pollutants discharged from ships. This technology is already being  used successfully on cruise ships in Alaska, thanks to that State's forward-thinking regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is real. The number of cruise ship passengers has been growing nearly twice as fast as any other mode of travel. In the U.S. alone the numbers are approaching ten million passengers a year. Some of these ships can carry 3,000 passengers. That is the size of a small city. As cities do, these ships produce massive amounts of waste--over 200,000 gallons of sewage each week; a million gallons of graywater from galleys, laundry, and showers; and over 35,000 gallons of oily bilge water  that collects in ship bottoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wastewater from cities, of course, is highly regulated. America wouldn't tolerate anything less. A city cannot simply dump waste into our waterways. We've seen, of course, what happens when municipal wastewater treatment systems are poorly operated or break down. People fall ill, beaches are closed, and ecosystems are harmed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what's the story for waste from cruise ships? Let us start with "black water" sewage--human body wastes and other toilet waste. Within three miles of shore, vessels can discharge this waste provided that a "marine sanitation device" is installed. The Environmental Protection Agency released a draft report in December, however, that concluded that these systems simply don't work. These sewage treatment devices leave discharges that consistently exceed national effluent standards for fecal  coliform and other pathogens and pollutants. In fact, fecal coliform levels in effluent are typically 20 to 200 times greater than in untreated domestic wastewater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond three miles from shore there are no restrictions on sewage discharge. Cruise ships are free to dump their sewage and foul U.S. waters with impunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The situation for graywater may be even more serious. Except in Alaska, cruise ship graywater requires no treatment whatsoever before being discharged, and there are no restrictions on where that dumping can be done. Yet graywater from sinks, tubs, and  kitchens contains large amounts of pathogens and pollutants--amounts that would never be tolerated from a land-based business. Fecal coliform concentrations, for example, are ten to a thousand times greater than those in untreated domestic wastewater. These pollutants sicken our marine ecosystems, wash up onto our beaches, and contaminate food and shellfish that end up on our dinner plates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Clean Cruise Ship Act seeks to solve this oversight in the current regulations, just as Alaska State law has done. No discharges whatsoever would be allowed within 12 miles of shore. Beyond twelve miles, discharges of sewage, graywater, and bilge water would be allowed, provided that they meet national effluent limits consistent with the best available technology. That technology works and is commercially available now. The recent Environmental Protection Agency study found that these "advanced  wastewater treatment" systems effectively remove pathogens, suspended solids, metals, and oil and grease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this legislation, the release of raw, untreated sewage would be banned everywhere. No dumping would be allowed of sewage sludge and incinerator ash in U.S. waters. All cruise ships calling on U.S. ports would have to dispose of hazardous waste in accordance to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The bill would establish inspection and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is one thing at this point I'd like to make clear. Many of us here have been working hard to stop aquatic invasive species that slip into our lakes and coastal waters in discharged ballast water. Alien species that have escaped into U.S. waters are causing massive harm. We have to do everything in our power to prevent new invasive species from getting loose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this in mind, many of us have been closely watching court cases surrounding the Environmental Protection Agency's responsibility for regulating ballast water under the Clean Water Act. That litigation may have implications for cruise ship wastewater pollution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have no intention of interfering with this court case. Likewise, I want to emphasize that this bill in no way undermines the provisions of the Clean Water Act that deal with discharges of pollution into the nation's waters. I have always supported the Clean Water Act. It will continue to be an important tool that, in conjunction with the Clean Cruise Ship Act, can significantly reduce wastewater pollution from cruise ships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The protection of U.S. waters is vital to our Nation's health and economy. There are 4.5 million square miles of ocean in the U.S. territorial seas--23 percent larger than our Nation's landmass. That's more than any other country has. Cruise ship wastewater threatens the very environments that family vacationers want to visit. Current regulations and voluntary guidelines for the cruise ship industry just aren't good enough. No other industry is allowed to pollute our waters at will. The cruise  ship industry is growing at nearly 5 percent each year, which means that the problem is growing, as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Uncontrolled dumping of cruise ship pollution must stop. We can achieve that goal with the Clean Cruise Ship Act. I recognize, though, that there may be other valid approaches. I encourage my colleagues to work with me to pass legislation this year that will put a stop to the dumping of hazardous pollutants along our coasts. Together we can clean up this major source of pollution that is harming our waters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the "Clean Cruise Ship Act of 2008".</narrative>
  <narrative> (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act is as follows:&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>Sec..1..Short title; table of contents.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..2..Findings and purposes.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..3..Definitions.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..4..Prohibitions on the discharge of sewage, graywater, bilge water, sewage sludge, incinerator ash, and hazardous waste.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..5..Effluent limits for discharges of sewage, graywater, and bilge water.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..6..Alaskan cruise vessels.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..7..Inspection and sampling.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..8..Employee protection.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..9..Judicial review.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..10..Enforcement.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..11..Citizen suits.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..12..Sense of Congress on ballast water.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..13..Sense of Congress on air pollution.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..14..Funding.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sec..15..Effect on other law.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Cruise vessels carry millions of people through North American waters each year, showcase some of the most beautiful ocean areas in the United States, and provide opportunities for passengers to relax and enjoy the oceans and marine ecosystems.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) A single cruise vessel generates a tremendous amount of waste each week, including an estimated 140,000 to 210,000 gallons of blackwater (sewage) and 1,000,000 gallons of graywater (including wastewater from dishwashers, showers, laundry, baths, and washbasins). Onboard amenities such as photo-processing, dry-cleaning, and hairdressing also generate hazardous waste streams.</narrative>
  <narrative> (3) In its final report, "An Ocean Blueprint for the 21st Century", released in 2004, the United States Commission on Ocean Policy found that these waste streams and the cumulative impacts caused when cruise vessels repeatedly visit the same environmentally sensitive areas, "if not properly disposed of and treated, can be a significant source of pathogens and nutrients with the potential to threaten human health and damage shellfish beds, coral reefs, and other aquatic life," thus threatening  the very environments cruise vessel passengers seek to explore.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) The cruise industry has grown by more than 6 percent annually since 2003 and is projected to continue growing. Cruise vessel capacity is also expanding dramatically; today cruise vessels can transport 5,000 passengers and crew members, but the next generation of cruise vessels is expected to carry 7,000 passengers and crew members. As the total number of passengers increases and the number of passengers per ship increases, the volume of waste entering these ocean ecosystems and the impact  of that waste on ocean ecosystems will also increase.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) In a 2005 report requested by the International Council of Cruise Lines, the Ocean Conservation and Tourism Alliance (OCTA) Science Panel recommended that "[a]ll blackwater should be treated", that discharging treated blackwater should be "avoided in ports, close to bathing beaches or water bodies with restricted circulation,  flushing or inflow", and that blackwater should not be discharged within 4 nautical miles of shellfish beds, coral reefs,  or other sensitive habitats.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) The OCTA Science Panel further recommended that graywater be treated in the same manner as blackwater and that sewage sludge be off-loaded to approved land-based facilities.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) The United States lacks a comprehensive wastewater management policy for large passenger vessels, and a new statutory regime for managing wastewater discharges from large passenger vessels that applies throughout the United States is needed to protect coastal and ocean areas from pollution generated by cruise vessels, to reduce and better regulate discharges from cruise vessels, and to improve monitoring, reporting, and enforcement of standards regarding discharges.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect the health and beauty of the marine and coastal ecosystems that cruise passengers enjoy, by--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) prohibiting the discharge of any untreated sewage, graywater, or bilge water from a cruise vessel calling on a port of the United States into the waters of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) prohibiting the discharge of any sewage sludge, incinerator ash, or hazardous waste from a cruise vessel calling on a port of the United States into the waters of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) establishing new national effluent limits for the discharge of treated sewage, treated graywater, and treated bilge water from cruise vessels not less than 12 miles from shore in any case in which the discharge is not within an area in which discharges are prohibited; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) ensuring that cruise vessels calling on ports of the United States comply with all applicable environmental laws.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3.

  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="Introducing S. 2882. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to provide for the presentation of a flag of the United States to the children of members of the Armed Forces who die in service; to the Committee on Armed Services.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2882">S. 2882</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator COLLINS and Senator ISAKSON to introduce legislation that would provide the secretaries of the military departments the authority to pay the necessary expenses that would accompany the presentation of a flag to each child of a servicemember killed in the service of the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The presentation of a remembrance flag to the family of a deceased servicemember is a time-honored tradition for each of the services which commemorates and memorializes the service of our men and women in uniform who have made the ultimate sacrifice to protect the liberties and freedoms we cherish. The remembrance flag is a profound symbol of the enduring appreciation of a grateful Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regrettably, however, there is an oversight in current law affecting which family members of a deceased servicemember may receive a flag. At present, the statute authorizes the secretaries of the services to present only two remembrance flags--one to the parents of the deceased servicemember and one to the person authorized to direct disposition of the servicemember. In many instances, the person authorized to direct disposition is also a primary next of kin of the servicemember. However, in  cases where the primary next of kin are the children of the deceased servicemember, which can occur in extended family situations, authorities do not exist for the secretaries of the services to provide a remembrance flag to the children of deceased servicemembers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation that my colleagues and I are introducing today will remedy this oversight. We believe that the children of deceased servicemembers should also be able to receive a remembrance flag in honor of the sacrifice made by their parent. Clearly, this is the right thing to do. I sincerely hope that my colleagues will join Senator COLLINS, Senator ISAKSON, and me in supporting this important legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300084" topic="Introducing S. 2883. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in commemoration of the centennial of the establishment of Mother's Day; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2883">S. 2883</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the women of our Nation who have the cherished title of mother and grandmother. Whether through natural means, adoption or foster care, their patience and unending well-spring of love and affection make an incredible difference in the lives of children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No treasure, no riches can ever compare with a profoundly reassuring hug, the kind words that soothe broken spirits, or that reminder, rooted in affection, that we're not living up to our full potential. They inspire, believe and ultimately profess enormous pride in us--no matter our successes or failures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why it is not surprising that a young woman from Grafton, West Virginia, took to the streets of her hometown to honor her recently departed mother's love and life by passing out white carnations to all those who passed by. Anna Jarvis' one simple act of personal commemoration in May 1908, grew year after year. Eventually, Grafton's efforts would be recognized by the entire State of West Virginia in 1910. This was the first time a state recognized Mother's Day, and many more would soon  follow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson declared the first national Mother's Day, and from that day until now, mothers have been honored with flowers, breakfast in bed, and of course, those endearing homemade cards by little children that are steeped in sentiment--and often covered in glitter, macaroni and school paste.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife Sharon would tell you that there is nothing more important than these simple gifts--first from our children, and now our grandchildren. They are cherished touchstones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, we think of our mothers as invincible. However, not even our mothers are immune to age or disease. For many families across the country, Mother's Day takes on even deeper meanings as parents get older.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my own life, my mother was a tremendous force. Each Mother's Day was a celebration of her spirit, intellect and determination--and all this was put to the test in her battle with Alzheimer's disease. It's not easy seeing the woman who raised you struggle with an illness that robs her of her dignity and quality of life. I know that my family is not the only one that has been touched by this disease--and I am certainly not the only son who could talk in such a deeply personal way about losing  a mother. But just like Anna Jarvis, my sisters and I sought to honor our mother--and perhaps in the process help another mother or grandmother or family--by opening the Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is altogether fitting and proper that as we prepare to commemorate that first, historic Mother's Day celebration in Grafton, that we as a Nation begin to reconnect with what Anna Jarvis was trying to achieve--community recognition of the role that women play in all our lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I am introducing legislation that authorizes the U.S. Treasury to mint commemorative coins to celebrate the centennial of Grafton's celebration. I am proud to have Senator ROBERT C. BYRD as an original cosponsor. The companion bill also has been introduced in the House of Representatives by my West Virginia colleague, SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO. The proceeds from the sale of these coins won't go to the Government. Instead they will go to two organizations that are actively working  to make a difference in the lives of our Nation's women who are battling breast cancer and osteoporosis--the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation and the National Osteoporosis Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every day can, and should be Mother's Day. Through this bill, Americans will now have the chance to show, with the purchase of these coins, the high  regard we have for not only our mothers and grandmothers, but our sisters and nieces, and all the women who have made a difference in our lives. In the process, we can contribute to funding research that will improve the quality of their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300025" topic="Introducing S. 2884. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide incentives to improve America's research competitiveness, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2884">S. 2884</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Research &amp; Development Tax Credit Improvement Act of 2008, legislation which would extend the R&amp;D tax credit for 5 years, phase-out the Basic Credit, and raise the rate of the Alternative Simplified Credit from 12 percent to 20 percent by 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who have followed the ongoing discussions regarding the R&amp;D tax credit will recognize that the legislation I am introducing shares the framework of a proposal already put forward by the senior Senator from the State of Utah, my good friend Orrin Hatch. Senator Hatch has done a superb job building a consensus around the need to transition to the Alternative Simplified Credit, and to raise that credit to provide a real incentive to the many companies that are unable to benefit  from the Basic Credit structure. I applaud his efforts in this regard, and I thank him for lending his support to the bill I am introducing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to note the contribution of the distinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, who has worked side-by-side with Senator Hatch on the Research and Development tax credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chief distinction between our two bills is the duration of the credit. The Hatch-Baucus bill proposes a permanent credit, while my bill would  extend the R&amp;D tax credit for five years. I certainly share the goal of providing a permanent R&amp;D tax credit, but I fear that the cost of doing so puts it beyond our reach. Yet we simply cannot continue to play "stop-and-go" with this critical research incentive. Since the R&amp;D tax credit was first enacted in 1981, Congress has had to extend it a dozen times, and it expired again at the end of last year. The constant uncertainty about the status of the credit has made it impossible for companies  to plan their research investments, and has seriously diminished the credit's role as an incentive for research and development here in the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A 5-year extension would give companies enough time to plan their research investments with the credit in mind, restoring the incentive-effect the R&amp;D credit has always been intended to provide. Just as important, the time frame I am proposing, coupled with the increase in the rate to 20 percent will allow for a smooth transition away from the Basic Credit to the Alternative Simplified Credit. The Basic Credit has served its purpose, but it has become hopelessly outmoded. Under the Basic Credit  methodology, companies wishing to calculate their R&amp;D credit must measure their current investments against a base that is stuck in the past--literally the tax years between 1984 and 1988. This period is simply not relevant to today's investment decisions, and because of that, fewer and fewer companies get any benefit at all from the Basic Credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By contrast, the Alternative Simplified Credit methodology allows companies to calculate their credit using a rolling average of their domestic investments over their three most-recent tax years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The value of doing this is evidenced by the fact that most companies have already switched to the Alternative Simplified Credit, even though it has been on the books for less than a year-and-a-half, and even though the credit rate is only 12 percent compared to the Basic Credit rate of 20 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The five-year extension I am proposing will allow for a smooth transition to the Alternative Simplified Credit, and will bring the R&amp;D tax credit up-to-date. Companies which still rely on the Basic Credit will be allowed to continue that credit for another two years, just as is contemplated by the legislation that Senators Hatch and Baucus have worked so hard on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Investment in research and development is critical to the breakthroughs we need to keep our economy competitive, and to create the good, high-paying jobs the American people deserve. The R&amp;D tax credit provides an important incentive for this investment, but it needs to be updated so more companies can benefit from it. While making the credit permanent is a worthwhile goal, the 5-year extension I am proposing today is "do-able", and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="Introducing S. 2885. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand the availability of industrial development bonds to facilities manufacturing intangible property; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2885">S. 2885</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would provide State and local development finance authorities with greater flexibility in promoting economic growth that meets the changing realities of an ever more global economy. Specifically, my bill would expand the definition of "manufacturing" as it pertains to the small-issue Industrial Development Bond, IDB, program to include the creation of "intangible" property. I am pleased to be joined by colleagues from both  sides of the aisle including Senators KERRY, SMITH, and BROWN, in introducing this critical legislation to promote economic development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's capacity to innovate is a key reason why our economy remains the envy of the world, even during these difficult economic times. Knowledge-based businesses have been at the forefront of this innovation that has bolstered the economy over the long-term. For example, science parks have helped lead the technological revolution and have created more than 300,000 high-paying science and technology jobs, along with another 450,000 indirect jobs for a total of 750,000 jobs in North America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear that the promotion of knowledge-based industries can be a key economic tool for states and localities. This is especially true for states that have seen a loss in traditional manufacturing. In my home state of Maine, we lost 28 percent of our total manufacturing employment over the last decade. I believe that it critical that we provide states and localities with a wider range of options in promoting economic development. My legislation will do just that by expanding the availability  small-issue IDBs to new economy industries, such as software and biotechnology, that have proven their ability to provide high-paying jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These IDBs allow State and local development finance authorities, like the Finance Authority of Maine, to issue tax-exempt bonds for the purpose of raising capital to provide low-cost financing of manufacturing facilities. These bonds, therefore, provide local authorities with an invaluable tool to attract new employers and assist existing one's to grow. The result is a win- win situation for local communities providing them with much needed jobs. Consequently, it only makes since to ensure that  these finance authorities have maximum flexibility in options to grow jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, my bill provides some technical clarity to distinguish between the phrases "functionally related and subordinate facilities" and "directly related and acillary facilities." Until 1988, there was little confusion based on Treasury regulations going back to 1972 that made it clear that "functionally related and subordinate facilities" were clearly eligible for financing through private activity tax-exempt bonds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, Congress enacted the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Bond Act of 1988 that imposed a limitation that not more than 25 percent of tax- exempt bond financing could be used on "directly related and ancillary facilities." While these two phrases appear to be very similar, they are indeed distinguishable from each other. Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Service has blurred this distinction between the phrases which has had an adverse impact on the way facilities are able to utilize tax-exempt  bond financing. My  legislation would make it clear that "functionally related and subordinate facilities" are not susceptible to the 25 percent limitation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must continue to encourage all avenues of economic development if Americas to compete in a changing and increasingly global economy and my legislation is one small step in furtherance of that goal. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="Introducing S. 2885. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand the availability of industrial development bonds to facilities manufacturing intangible property; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, Senator Snowe and I are introducing legislation that would expand the availability of the Industrial Development Bond, IDB, program. The small-issue IDB program has given State and local governments a low-cost source of financing to create and retain jobs in manufacturing plants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, numerous technological advances have driven software and biotechnology to the forefront of our economy. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are more than 400 biotechnology companies in Massachusetts alone, employing more than 42,000 and paying more than $5 billion in annual salaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, the small-issue IDB program is limited only to manufacturing facilities. As our economy continues to evolve, so must our policies. Our legislation would allow IDBs to be used for high-technology and biotechnology uses. The definition of manufacturing would be broadened to include the creation of intangible property--specifically, patents, copyrights, formulas, processes, designs, patterns, know-how and other similar items.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Expanding the current definition of manufacturing to include "knowledge based" companies would promote economic development in our local communities as well as nationwide. This legislation is supported by the Council of Development Finance Agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to expanding the definition of manufacturing, the legislation clarifies that a manufacturing facility includes functionally related and subordinate facilities as part of the facility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will provide a boost to the economy by fostering development in technology. I urge my colleagues to support this common sense change.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="Introducing S. 2886. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to amend certain expiring provisions; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2886">S. 2886</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing a tax package that would extend relief from the alternative minimum tax and extend other much-needed individual and business provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the economy is turning down, Americans need certainty about their taxes. Families and businesses need to know what the tax law is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why my bill provides a one year patch for the AMT. The patch will hold the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT at 4.2 million. We will not let more taxpayers fall into the alternative minimum tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, Congress did not put a patch in place until December. We must act sooner this year. Through this bill, Congress can act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why my package contains a 2-year extension of provisions that expired at the end of last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These include the qualified tuition deduction to give families relief from high tuition costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My package also includes the teacher expense deduction. This deduction gives teachers some of the money that they spend on school supplies to educate our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The package also includes the State and local sales tax deduction for those States without an income tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill offers an extension of the research and development credit. This credit gives an incentive to businesses to invest in research. It helps to keep America competitive in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My package will also extend provisions that expire this year for an additional year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill extends much-needed energy provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Public and private investment in the renewable energy sector was about $90 billion worldwide last year. That's a 27 percent increase over 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress can direct this investment toward the U.S.--rather than overseas--by supporting clean energy tax incentives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These incentives include tax credits for wind and solar power, efficient buildings and appliances, and clean renewable energy bonds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These provisions are not only good energy policy. They also create jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This package would also extend wind and solar provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American solar industry employs 20,000 Americans. With a long-term extension of the solar tax credit, that number would triple.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American wind industry expanded by 45 percent in 2007. It contributed about 30 percent of the new power capacity in America last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These job-creating industries are growing fast. We should support them. We know what happens when we don't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, the tax credit for production of renewable energy was enacted in 1992, starting the growth of renewable power in the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But since 1999, this credit has expired three times. And when it expires, clean energy suffers, leading to declines between 73 percent and 93 percent in wind energy investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to keep this credit going to ensure consistent investment in the wind power industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This package would also promote energy efficiency. Efficiency is the low- hanging fruit in the energy debate. We can make big strides toward energy independence and a clean environment by getting more for our energy buck.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, ENERGY STAR--a voluntary labeling program designed to promote energy-efficient products--saved businesses, organizations, and consumers an estimated $14 billion in 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Efficiency also creates jobs. The American Solar Energy Society reported that in 2006, the efficiency industry created 8 million jobs, over half of them in manufacturing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The government plays a key role in sustaining the efficiency industry, through tax incentives for efficient commercial buildings, homes, and appliances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This package would also extend the clean renewable energy bonds, or CREBs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CREBs passed in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. CREBs spurred more than 700 new wind, biomass, solar, and hydro projects. The number of projects far exceeded the funding available to pay for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But CREBs funding lapsed at the end of 2007. That halted development of new projects and the green-collar jobs that go with them. We must keep these projects going.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CREBs provision was written for non-taxable entities like rural co-ops. Those non-taxable entities cannot use other tax incentives in this package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've listed just a few of the important energy items in this extenders bill. There are more. And I plan to build upon this package as it makes its way through the legislative process, with edits and additional items. The Finance Committee has been working to that end for the better part of a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last June, the Finance Committee passed a roughly $30 billion energy-tax package, with a resounding bipartisan vote. A majority of the Senate voted for that bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we were just shy of getting the required 60 votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We tried again in December, with a slimmer package. That time, we fell short of the required 60 by just one vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We then tried in February, as part of economic stimulus bill. We offered a package very similar to what passed last week. That amendment got 58 votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, this body passed, by a solid 88-8 vote, a package of energy-tax extenders, similar to the package considered during the economic stimulus debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A vote of 88 to 8 might suggest that there is smooth sailing ahead on energy-tax legislation. But I'm afraid that's not the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The day before the Senate passed its housing bill, including the energy-tax package, the House Ways and Means Committee passed its own housing relief bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ways and Means bill restated the House's position on pay-go. The House requires that the most of the tax package be offset.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How did the Ways and Means Committee offset the bill? Largely with a provision called "basis reporting." President Bush included this in his 2009 budget proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, the House paid for a tax package with an item already supported, at least in principle, by the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I believe that this Congress should have paid for energy-tax legislation with the offsets passed by Finance Committee last year, it's not clear that passing that package gets us any further to extending these important tax incentives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I have been working on offsets that can pass both bodies and be signed by the President. That is what I will continue to do to get these important energy items--as well as other vital extenders--passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By taking care of this now, we can spend more of our time on other things like tax reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I plan to hold several hearings and roundtables to cuss tax reform. We began this week. I'm serious about simplifying our tax code. I am serious about helping the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress should do more than just extend legislation. Congress needs to work on new policy, new legislation, and new ideas. And by enacting this legislation, we can turn to those important goals. I urge my colleagues to support this package.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300061" topic="Introducing S. 2888. A bill to protect the property and security of homeowners who are subject to foreclosure proceedings, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2888">S. 2888</bill>] The legislation I have introduced with Senators Collins and Lincoln attacks the growing problem of foreclosure rescue scams. I held a revealing hearing in the Aging committee that uncovered the ways scam artists prey on homeowners already in financial and emotional distress. These scams are another consequence of the mortgage crisis that is plaguing our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For most people, their home is their greatest asset. When a homeowner falls behind in their mortgage payments, it is a great emotion strain. Scam artists prey on an owner's desperation and give them a false sense of security, claiming they can help "save their home." The types of scams vary, but the end result is that the homeowner is left in a more desperate situation than before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are three types of prevalent scams. The first is "phantom help," where the "rescuer" claims that they call the homeowner's lender and re-negotiate the loan for a fee. Often the homeowner will pay the fee and the "rescuer," will abandon the homeowner without performing any intervention. The second is a "rent-to-own" scheme which is set up to fail. A homeowner will sign over the title of the house and make monthly payments to the scammer in order to help rebuild their credit. However,  the monthly payments are extremely high and often result in the homeowner violating the contract and being evicted. Finally, a homeowner may be tricked into unknowingly signing over the title of their house and power of attorney to the scammer and the scammer will then sell the house to a third party. The scam artist might give the homeowner a small amount of money, but often only a fraction of the actual selling price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As one can clearly see, these scams are well crafted and extremely complicated. Catie Doyle, the Chief attorney for Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee, testified before the Special Committee on Aging, describing the difficulties and problems lawyers are facing when trying to help victims of these scams. One major problem she pointed out was that lawyers have to piece together both state and federal laws to untangle these scams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Foreclosure Rescue Fraud Act that Senators Collins, Lincoln and I are offering will remedy Ms. Doyle's concerns. While there are some states that have foreclosure rescue scam laws or are in the process of enacting them, many homeowners still go unprotected from these predators. This legislation will require that all contracts between a foreclosure consultant be in writing and fully disclose the nature of the services and the exact amount. Additionally, the bill prohibits up-front  fees from being collected and prohibits a "consultant" from obtaining the power of attorney from a homeowner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also have a letter of support from a variety of consumer groups including the Center of Responsible Lending, Consumer Federation of America, National Community Reinvestment Coalition, and the National Council of La Raza.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The foreclosure crisis is real. Most communities across the country are experiencing both the primary and secondary effects. It is important that we address fraud at the front end of the lending process, as well, as for those who face foreclosure. I hope that we can work together to move this legislation forward.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I introduce legislation requested by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, as a courtesy to the Secretary and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Except in unusual circumstances, it is my practice to introduce legislation requested by the Administration so that such measures will be available for review and consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This "by-request" bill would address a range of issues. On the health care side, it would allow VA to contract with community residential care programs for veterans with serious traumatic brain injury. It would also eliminate copayments for all hospice care. Further, it would expand continuing education benefits for physicians and dentists. Finally, it would allow the Secretary to disclose the names and addresses of certain VA patients without prior written consent to collect payment from third-party  health plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the benefits side, this legislation would permanently authorize VA to use data provided by the IRS and the Social Security Administration to verify the incomes of recipients of needs-based benefits from VA. VA uses this data to ensure that it does not disburse benefits and payments to individuals who do not legally qualify to receive them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would also provide a cost-of-living increase for VA disability compensation for service-connected veterans and dependency and indemnity compensation for survivors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am introducing this bill for the review and consideration of my colleagues at the request of the Administration. As chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have not taken a position on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a letter of support be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>THE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, March 18, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>Dear Mr. President: We are transmitting a draft bill, "To amend title 38, United States Code, to improve veterans' health care benefits and for other purposes," We request that the bill be referred to the appropriate committee for prompt consideration and enactment. Enclosed with the bill is a sectional analysis that describes each provision, provides a rationale for the provision, and provides estimates of the costs, savings and revenues that would result from enactment. Our draft  bill includes proposals contained in the President's FY 09 budget request, to include a cost-of living increase in rates of disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation. Two of the proposals are discussed in further detail below.</narrative>
  <narrative>This Administration advocates focusing greater attention on the long-term residential rehabilitation needs of veterans with traumatic brain injuries who do not require nursing home care but are unable to live independently in their homes. In furtherance of that policy, our bill would authorize the Secretary, in carrying out the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) community residential care program, to contract for specialized residential care and rehabilitation services for veterans of Operation  Enduring Freedom and/or Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) who: (1) suffer from traumatic brain injury, (2) have an accumulation of deficits in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living that affects their ability to care for themselves, and (3) would otherwise receive their care and rehabilitation</narrative>
  <narrative>In 2004, Congress amended the law to eliminate copayment requirements for hospice care furnished in a VA nursing home. The bill contains a provision to exempt all hospice care from copayments by amending 38 U.S.C. &#xA7;1710 to eliminate co-payment requirements for veterans receiving VA hospice care either in a VA hospital or at home on an outpatient basis. The provision would provide equitable treatment for all veterans receiving such care and would also align VA with the Medicare program, which  does not impose co-payments for hospice care (regardless of setting). There are no costs associated with enactment of this proposal. Projected discretionary revenue loss is estimated to be $149,000 in fiscal year 2009 and $1,400,000 over 10 years.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Office of Management and Budget advises that the transmission of this legislative package is in accord with the President's program.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely yours,</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300071" topic="Introducing S. 2890. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for a highway fuel tax holiday; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2890">S. 2890</bill>] Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senators Kyl, Burr, Graham, Martinez, Warner, Chambliss, Lieberman, Wicker and Sununu in introducing legislation that would provide all Americans with a "gas tax holiday" this summer. This bill would suspend the 18.4 cents-per-gallon Federal tax on gasoline and the 24.4 cents-per-gallon tax on diesel fuel from Memorial Day to Labor Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, this legislation was put forward on the Senate floor as an amendment to the Highway Technical Corrections bill, but it was blocked from being considered. I now call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together to support this proposal that would provide immediate relief to all Americans suffering from the high price of gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, hardworking American families are facing many difficult challenges due to the current economic realities facing our country. Now, more than ever, they find themselves having to choose between basic needs to provide for their families, and this is being greatly exacerbated by rising gasoline prices, which have risen by more than 58 percent in the last 14 months. That is why I am pleased to be joined by so many of my colleagues in offering a proposal to provide some needed relief  for every person who will be filling their gas or diesel tanks this summer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past year, the price of unleaded regular gas has increased 53 cents per gallon. Diesel fuel prices nationwide are now over $1.30 more per gallon more than this time last year. With the growing financial strains placed on so many Americans--rising food prices and falling home prices--the additional hit of rising fuel prices is becoming the breaking point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an effort to ease some of the hardship caused by the higher fuel prices, our bill would suspend the Federal tax on gas and the tax on diesel fuel from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Last Memorial Day, alone, approximately 32 million Americans traveled by car 50 miles or more from home. Suspending the federal excise tax during the summer, when fuel prices have historically been at the highest annually, would allow Americans to keep a few more of their hard-earned dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, let me be clear: this bill would not harm the Highway Trust Fund. This bill would ensure that the Highway Trust Fund remains whole during this "gas tax holiday" by transferring monies from the General Treasury. We all agree that our roads and highways must be maintained and improved to ensure the safety of the road-traveling public, and this amendment would do nothing to impact highway construction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, my colleagues have an opportunity to take meaningful action to ease some of the financial burdens that are impacting all hardworking Americans every time they fill up their gas or diesel tanks. Let's put some acton behind the usual rhetoric around here and vote to ease their tax burden this summer.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="Introducing S. 2891. A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to apply the protections of the Act to teaching and research assistants; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2891">S. 2891</bill>] Mr. President, it is important for Congress to do more to guarantee graduate students the right to organize and to bargain over their wages and working conditions as teaching and research assistants, so I am introducing legislation today to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than ever in modern education, teaching and research assistants are in classrooms every day, educating students in colleges and universities across the country. Their numbers are increasing as the number of full time faculty dwindles. Often, teaching and research assistants are now doing the same job as junior faculty members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, the classroom is a workplace for these scholars. It's where they earn the money they need to pay to put food on their tables and a roof over their heads. They deserve the right to stand together and make their voice heard in their workplace. Like other employees, they should have the right to join a union and improve their working conditions. Obviously, better wages and working conditions for them also means better education for their students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, however, a decision by the National Labor Relations Board changed the law and denied fundamental workplace rights and protections for teaching and research assistants. This ruling stopped an active organizing movement in its tracks and deprived thousands of teaching and research assistants of their right to organize and bargain over their wages and working conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is hardly the only bad decision by the National Labor Relations Board under the Bush administration, which has been the most anti-worker, anti-labor, anti-union NLRB in history. The Board has let workers down at every turn. It has blocked efforts to gain union representation, undermined workers' attempts to improve their pay and benefits, and exposed them to penalties for seeking to improve their working conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Labor Relations Board is supposed to protect the rights of American workers, but it is failing teaching and research assistants, just as it has failed so many others. By passing the Teaching and Research Assistants Collective Bargaining Rights Act, Congress will give these workers back the rights that the National Labor Relations Board has taken away. This legislation amends the definition of employee under the National Labor Relations Act to explicitly include teaching and research  assistants at private universities and colleges and restores the law to where it was before the Bush board's anti-worker decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is a significant step forward in restoring workers' rights, and I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this important legislation.</paragraph>
