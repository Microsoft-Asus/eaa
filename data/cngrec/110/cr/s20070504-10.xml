    <paragraph>Mr. President, often discussions about combating gun violence center around preventing criminal access to dangerous firearms. Another important component of the issue is the ability of our children and teenagers to access firearms. Most fatal firearm incidences occur when children and teens discover loaded and unsecured firearms in their homes. Over the years, accidental shootings and suicides have claimed the lives of thousands of young people. Sadly, many of these tragedies could  have been prevented through common sense gun legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 14, two 14-year-old boys were playing in one of their homes in Iosco Township, MI, when they found an unlocked .45-caliber handgun. After playing with it for a short time, the gun went off. The two boys were home alone, so no adult was aware of what happened until one of the boys called 911 and uttered the words, "I shot him." The other boy was pronounced dead after being airlifted to the University of Michigan Medical Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The very next day not far away in Battle Creek, MI, a 19-year-old accidentally shot and killed his 17-year-old best friend and cousin. The two were sitting on a couch in the living room, playing with an unregistered gun. They had removed the gun's clip but were not aware of the single bullet remaining in the chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are two examples of the misery gun violence can inflict. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have released some staggering statistics on gun-related deaths among young people:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2002 a child or teen was killed in a firearm-related accident or suicide every 9 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On average, four children died every day in non-homicide firearm incidents between 1999-2002.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1997-2002, more than 1,324 children were killed in firearm accidents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, 13,846 kids were injured by a firearm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last 10 years, an average of 1,213 kids committed suicide with a firearm each year; on average more than 135 each year were under the age of 15.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The overall firearm-related death rate among U.S. children under the age of 15 was nearly 12 times higher than among children in 25 other industrialized countries combined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As adults, parents and grandparents, we have a responsibility to protect our children from gun-related deaths. Trigger locks and other sensible gun safety measures can have a significant impact. I urge my colleagues to wait no longer to act on such measures.</paragraph>
