    <paragraph>Mr. President, Dr. Rufus Judson Pearson, Jr., of Southern Pines, NC, passed away in Tamarac, Fl. on Sunday, May 11, 2008 after a prolonged illness and went to be with the Lord and to the side of his beloved wife, Emily.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Pearson, the former attending physician to the U.S. Congress, was born in Atlanta, GA, October 8, 1915, the son of Rufus J. Pearson, M.D., and Myrtle Padgett of Richland, GA. He attended the University of Florida and received his doctor of medicine degree from Emory University in 1938 at the age of 22. He trained at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn and at Grady Hospital in Atlanta and subsequently had a year of intensive training in cardiovascular Diseases offered by Harvard Medical School  at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, under the tutelage of renowned cardiologist Dr. Paul Dudley White.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Pearson was fellow of the American College of Physicians, the American College of Cardiology, the Scientific Council, American Heart Association, and member, American Medical Association. He was certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine and by the Sub-specialty Board in Cardiovascular Disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In May of 1939, following first year of internship, he married the former Emily Virginia Timmerman of Atlanta, GA, whom he met during his first year as a medical student at Emory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During World War II, he served overseas as a naval medical officer, and after the war, he entered the private practice of internal medicine in Jacksonville, FL. Shortly after the outbreak of the Korean crisis in 1950, he was recalled to Active Duty and subsequently decided to make the Navy a career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He rose to prominence in the Medical Corps while serving as chief of cardiology at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, MD, from 1955 to 1961 during the period when open-heart surgery was being pioneered. He later served as chief of medicine at the Naval Hospitals in Charleston, SC and Portsmouth, VA. In 1965, he returned to the al Hospital at Bethesda to serve as director of clinical services and chief of medicine. To each of these assignments, he brought a high level of professional  competence, coupled with dynamic leadership, drive and imagination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1966, at the request of speaker John McCormack and Senate majority leader Mike Mansfield and by joint concurrence of both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, Dr. Pearson was assigned as the attending physician to Congress, a position he held for almost 7 years and only the second physician to ever hold that post. He brought to this unique position exceptional skill, innovation, and farsighted leadership, effecting numerous improvements to the health care delivery system  in the Capitol complex. He was highly regarded by Members of the House and Senate, not only as skilled physician, but also as a friend and confidant to many, earning the respect of the Nation's legislators and their staffs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On numerous occasions--his praises by Members of the House and Senate were made a matter of record in the Congressional Record. On such comment offered by Senator Aiken from Vermont is quoted in the Record:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Pearson will probably be missed as much as anyone who as ever has worked in the Capitol. It did not matter what we called him. We started out calling him "Admiral," and pretty soon we called him "Doctor." Finally, he got to be known as "Jud" and his wife as Emily. They certainly are people with whom we could be very proud to have worked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And another quote from Senator Mansfield of Montana:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Pearson has created a medical facility in the Capitol that is almost unequaled. His main purpose was our health and well being, but also he was there to offer his friendship and advice whether it be for us, our families, or our staffs. No task was too great, no hours too late, no burden too heavy for "Jud" Pearson. ..... Dr. Pearson's integrity, dedication, and deep devotion have been the cause of his excellence in his present position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was chosen to accompany the majority leader and minority leader of the Senate on their historic trip to China in 1972 and was at that time one the first few American physicians to enter China since World War II. For his exceptional service to the country while serving at the U.S. Capitol, the President of the United States presented him with the Distinguished Service Medal. Following his retirement in 1973, the Pearsons retired to the Sandhills area of North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Pearson was a most enthusiastic golfer and a member of Columbia Country Club and the Whispering Pines Country Club. He was also a highly skilled and avid bridge player and was invited to participate as a member of the Wolves Club in Southern Pines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Pearson was a marvelous and compassionate physician-scholar as well as skilled in his profession. He was a wonderful father and strong patriarch, both generous and kind. But friends and relatives alike will attest that his many significant contributions and achievements pale in comparison to the remarkable example he set as a devoted husband to his beloved wife Emily, to whom he was united in marriage for 67 years, loving her, cherishing her and caring for her until her death at the age of  91. Theirs was truly a marriage made in heaven.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is survived by his daughter, Mrs. Virginia P. Sudders of Tamarac, FL, and his son, CPT Rufus J. Pearson, III, and daughter-in-law, Elizabeth Pearson, of Wheaton, IL; eight grandchildren: Rufus Judson Pearson, IV, Matthew Allen Pearson, Andrew Clinton Pearson, Mrs. Kathryn Elizabeth Pearson Dickson, Mrs. Amy Sudders Wilke, Mrs. Barbara Sudders Andrade, Ms. Marylou Sudders, Mrs. Susan Sudders Kuper; and nine great-grandchildren.</paragraph>
