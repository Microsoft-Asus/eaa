    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, what kind of Nation are we when 47 million Americans go to bed every night without adequate health care coverage? And what kind of Nation will we become when we turn our backs on those who need us the most, our Nation's children, on whose future we all depend?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SCHIP bill, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, will provide access to necessary medical services to 11 million of our children who are most in need. We cannot, we shall not, we must not turn our backs on our Nation's children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues who have yet to consider voting up or down on this measure to think this thing all the way through. Whose side are you on? Are you on the side of our children, who need you the most? Or are you on the side of special interests? We Democrats are on the side of children. Please reconsider what kind of Nation we will be when we turn our backs on our children.</paragraph>
