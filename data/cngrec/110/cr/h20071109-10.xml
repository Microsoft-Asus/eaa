    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to a new report by Human Rights Watch detailing the use of child soldiers in Burma, particularly by the brutal dictatorship there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Past reports have suggested that there are approximately 70,000 child soldiers in Burma, the largest child soldier army in the world. It is difficult to know the exact number. But we do know that not only does the SPDC regime refuse to allow democracy and engages in ethnic cleansing, it also deliberately, as policy, targets children for military recruitment, training, and battle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Children are targeted simply walking down the street or waiting for a train. If they don't have their ID cards, so-called "recruiters" tell the children they will be sent to prison or they can join the army. If the children try to run away, they are severely punished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Children are also forced by the SPDC to participate in human rights violations such as burning down villages or shooting villagers on sight, women and children included.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the SPDC dictatorship must go. It is time for democracy in Burma.</paragraph>
