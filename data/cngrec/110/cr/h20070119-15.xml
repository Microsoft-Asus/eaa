    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during the last election, Democrats had a conversation with the American people. We listened to their concerns; the skyrocketing prices of college tuition and prescription drugs, the dangerously low minimum wage, the persisting security threats to our Nation, gas price gouging by Big Oil, and the disgraceful way the House has been conducting the People's business, and we promised to act quickly to make important changes and take America in a new direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that we can report to those millions of Americans who voted to elect a Democratic majority in Congress, we have heard your concerns and we have taken action. Already less than 100 hours into this new Democratic Congress, we have passed legislation to clean up House ethics rules, implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations, raised the minimum wage, end Federal subsidies to Big Oil, and lower the price of prescription drugs and a college education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, great progress has been made already this session, but these first 100 hours are just the beginning. Democrats are committed to continuing to improve the lives of all Americans. That is what we were elected to do.</paragraph>
