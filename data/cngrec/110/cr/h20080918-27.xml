  <narrative>SUPPORTING EXPANSION OF ELIGIBILITY OF BENEFITS FOR FILIPINO VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8402]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to urge the immediate support for the expansion of the eligibility of benefits for Filipino vets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On July 26, 1941, Franklin Roosevelt brought the Philippine Commonwealth Forces under the control of the United States during World War II. Yet when their service ended, they did not receive the same benefits or treatment as other American soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress passed the Rescission Act in 1946, against General MacArthur's open objections. This even includes such things as burial benefits. No other group of veterans has been systematically denied these benefits. There will be only 20,000 left by 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is some contention here that the Filipino veterans that fought with us as allies are not U.S. citizens. We are paying Sunni tribesmen who killed American soldiers bribe money today in Iraq, but the Filipino vets who saved American soldiers are left out of the benefits as allies of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is shameful and needs to be stopped immediately. Bring those benefits to these Filipino vets, who are the allies and comrades in arms of United States soldiers.</paragraph>
