  <speaking speaker="300010" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor today to note an anniversary. Although you may have noticed there has been no gift giving, no celebration, no remembrances of the day, the promise was made. That is because the people who made the promise failed to keep their promise. They failed to bring the change they promised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, to what promise am I referring? I am referring to the day, 2 years ago today--April 24, 2006--when then-House minority leader Nancy Pelosi announced "Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices." She told the American people that if they put Democrats in charge of the House and the Senate, we would all see lower gas prices. The then-minority leader, the senior Senator from Nevada, said, on that same day, that it was just "about priorities."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, it is time to get real about energy. Democrats running for office across the Nation in 2006 said change would come with a Democratic Congress. Well, we certainly got change all right. Since the Democrats have come to power in the House and Senate, pain at the pump has increased by 50 percent. Americans who paid, on average, $2.33 a gallon in January 2007 now pay $3.53 a gallon, on average--hardly a change any of us bargained for. However, $3.53 is just the national average. Some are paying  much more. To just take a few States, in California, it is $3.87; in Nevada, it is 3.60; in Illinois, it is $3.67; in New York, it is $3.67. Mr. President, $1.30 more for a gallon of gas is certainly not the kind of change I</paragraph>
    <paragraph>would believe in or support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is this doing to hardworking families struggling just to get by? "With gas hitting record highs, drivers [are] feeling squeezed," as my home State Kansas City Star reported this week. For example, Carol Licata, a 75-year-old retiree, told in the story of how a larger part of her fixed income is now going toward gas. She said that "to get to the doctors . . . it's an awful lot of money . . . I don't drive that often, but I have to take necessary trips . . . and [gas] takes a big chunk  out of our budget."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fixed-income seniors, though, are not the only ones suffering record pain at the pump. Consider the plight of low-income workers struggling to get to work. Their affordable housing is a great distance, maybe, from where they have a good-paying job. Maybe they are driving from the inner city out to a suburban job or from a distant suburb, where housing prices are lower, to the city. Either way, modest-income folks with the least ability to pay higher gas prices are hit especially hard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What about truckers? For all the hard work they put in on the open roads, they never seem to make more than a modest living. Now they are being hit with even higher diesel prices. At $4.20 a gallon, diesel prices are 40 percent higher than they were a year ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, this pain at the pump is just one more burden families and workers are bearing at the same time as a housing meltdown, higher food prices, higher health care prices, higher power bills, higher heating bills, and I expect, this summer, higher air-conditioning bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what is the Democrats' "commonsense plan" to lower gas prices and help working families? With record-high gas prices, it is clear we are still waiting for the "commonsense" part of the solution. About the only thing we have heard proposed from the other side is to increase taxes on oil companies. Since when does raising taxes on something increase its supply or lower its price? Never. Again, that is all we hear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is so sad is the fact that we are sitting on top of a big part of the solution. We can lower the prices by tapping the millions of barrels of oil just waiting for us here in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Alaska, above the barren Arctic Circle, Democrats refuse to allow us to tap millions of barrels of oil in an environmentally safe manner. They say drilling in an area smaller than the size of Dulles Airport would have too great an impact on an area the size of the State of South Carolina. Congress, in 1996, passed a budget resolution which would have allowed the opening of ANWR. However, President Clinton vetoed that resolution, pointing out that he opposed and would not support opening ANWR.  Had ANWR been opened, there would be a million more barrels of oil a day flowing into the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, speaking of South Carolina, Democrats refused to let us get at millions of barrels of oil and natural gas a safe distance off our coastal shores, literally unseen because it is over the horizon. Some say this is another example of "not in my backyard," or "NIMBY," but this is really a case of not in "your" backyard because the people, for example, of Alaska and Virginia are happy with and want to tap the oil and gas on their lands and off their shores.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Democrats still refuse to unlock the vast untapped natural resources  here at home. Our dependence on foreign sources of energy grows greater, and families continue to suffer. Is it any wonder Americans are fed up? Democrats are looking at thirsty Americans and saying: You should drink less or drive less. Now, do not get me wrong, I support and have supported aggressive but achievable automobile fuel efficiency increases, incentivizing low-emission  vehicles such as hybrids and plug-ins, and more fuels from renewable sources, but these are long-range solutions that will not pay dividends for years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some say opening our reserves would not pay dividends for years. While it will take time for the oil to start flowing, there would be a message. Right now, the market is factoring in the present U.S. attitude which says we will do nothing to increase our supplies of oil. A change in our attitude would change their attitude for the future. Saying we are going to increase supply and cut demand would help relieve the pressure. I think we need to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another pressure I support relieving is continuing to add to the strategic petroleum reserves during times of record-high prices. We need to stop supplying these strategic petroleum reserves when gas hits $3 a gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, my friends on the other side, predominantly, support legislation that will send gas prices even higher. I am referring to the Warner-Lieberman climate bill the majority plans to bring to the floor in early June. In pushing forward that bill, Democrats are willing to say that $3.53 a gallon gas is not enough. They will be telling the American people that gas prices should be even higher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Environmental Protection Agency recently estimated that Lieberman-Warner will force gasoline prices to rise $1.44 per gallon higher. For those of you keeping score at home, that would mean $5-a-gallon gasoline. It boggles the mind, the majority advocating $5-a-gallon gas in just over a month, but that is what they would be doing supporting that bill. That is not the kind of change our families and workers need. That is not common sense. That is why there are no flowers today, no fancy dinner  tonight. On this anniversary, there will only be more pain at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Texas.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Missouri for making enormous common sense on a subject where, frankly, the Congress can only be characterized as having a schizophrenic approach to our energy crisis today. Congress always seems to talk a good game, but when it comes to actually doing something about it, the solutions seem to be few and far between.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, too, think it is important to remember that since Speaker Pelosi made that promise 2 years ago, we have not had anything happen in the Congress that would indicate that this "commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices" is any closer today than it was 2 years ago. You would think, if any party has a commonsense solution to help reduce the pain at the pump, they would be eager to unveil it and to debate it on the floor, to show it off. But, of course, as we finished  out the 2006 session of Congress, we got no such bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So again, as elections are heating up, and, as we all know, our constituents back home are feeling the pain at the pump--and whereas there is a lot of concern today about food prices--a lot of the increase in food prices is caused because of increased costs of production on the farm, primarily energy costs. Again, we see that as it becomes a political football, it has become something to talk about in election season. But when it comes to the fact that now our Democratic friends have control  of both Houses of Congress, we have seen no action--zero action--taken to reduce the price of gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The price of gas, as we know, has continued to go up. Here is a chart that indicates--right here on Capitol Hill--that back in, I guess we can call it, the good old days, unleaded regular was $3.09 a gallon. Today, in April 2008, it is $3.49 a gallon, right here in Washington, DC. In some parts of the country, it is approaching $4 a gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While $3.09 is certainly not a low price by anybody's reckoning, it certainly looks pretty good today. But, frankly, we have not seen our colleagues on the other side of the aisle work with us to support any legislation that would be calculated to bring down the price of gas at the pump. As a matter of fact, this is calculated into the inaction as a result of the energy policies by the majority, and you see it costs the average American family $1,400 a year in additional energy costs, additional  gasoline costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So while the majority, which really runs the Congress, is quick to blame others for high oil prices, it is, in fact, their inaction that continues to raise gas prices. I wonder how long it will be before our friends on the other side of the aisle--who won the last election, who claimed a mandate as a result of that election--are actually going to act like the majority that they now are and help work with us to bring down prices at the pump. How long will it be before they stop pointing the finger  of blame and start looking in the mirror for the solutions?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only way we are going to resolve this schizophrenia when it comes to our energy policy is by Republicans and Democrats working together to pass commonsense legislation which will have the effect of bringing down the price of gasoline at the pump. I will talk about some of those in a minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The simple truth is, those who have been entrusted with the majority in the Senate and the House have failed to act to lower energy prices at all. Rather than show us their commonsense solution, as Speaker Pelosi talked about, they have opted to pursue political posturing, which has done nothing to deal with the problem. So, as we see, the problem just gets worse and worse and worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, our side does not have all the answers, but we have proposed some good solutions, I think, which would help address America's growing energy crisis that we should and could act upon to start bringing the price of gas down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say, first of all, there are several reasons why the price of gasoline is so high today. First and foremost is skyrocketing consumption in other parts of the world. This commodity is in great demand, and we are competing literally with the entire world for this scarce commodity known as oil that is then refined to make gasoline. Of course, we know there remains political unrest in producing countries as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every one of these problems could be mitigated, if not solved outright, by promoting and investing in America's natural resources rather than continuing to be so dependent on imported oil and gas from dangerous parts of the world and from our enemies such as Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are a politically stable nation with the resources to invest in maintaining our infrastructure and to add production that would greatly increase the available oil and gas supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of that adds up to lower costs at the pump and more money in the pockets of American citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a lot Congress can do that would be positive, but the one thing we can't do is to repeal the law of supply and demand. When you have a fixed supply and the demand goes up, the price invariably goes up. I don't know why Congress refuses to acknowledge that simple law of economics of supply and demand, and add to the supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First and foremost, we need to increase American energy production right here at home. Unfortunately, we see time after time and, again, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle block commonsense energy policies that would give American companies access to valuable resources such as oil deposits in the Arctic, in Alaska, the Outer Continental Shelf, on Government lands, and shale oil sites that have great promise in terms of the volume of oil that can be produced, the major component of  gasoline. Of all of the cost drivers in gasoline, it is the price of oil that causes the greatest increase. If we could increase the supply of oil by increasing America's supply of oil by developing the resources we have in our country, it would vastly improve the situation we are in now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to lowering prices at the pump and increasing domestic energy production, it would also create more jobs in America. At a time when Congress is passing economic stimulus programs, spending enormous sums of taxpayer money, one of the best things we  could simply do is to change the policies that would allow us to explore and develop our own natural resources rather than depend on imported oil from foreign sources. Personally, I have always  liked to see the "Made in America" label when I buy a product. Wouldn't it be nice to see that on the side of a gas pump here at home? Think of the thousands of jobs that could help kick-start our economy if we actually encouraged American energy production and less dependence on foreign sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond increasing the supply of oil, we also need to increase our refinery capacity, the place where that oil is then made into gasoline. We haven't built any new refineries in this country since the 1970s because of restrictive policies of the Federal Government. One of the most costly steps in producing gasoline is refining oil to make it usable in vehicles. Since we have limited refining capacity--again, the law of supply and demand--a fixed supply and increasing demand is driving up the cost  of gasoline because we don't have the refinery capacity to make the gasoline out of the oil. So prices continue to go up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, any American energy policy must, of course, include alternative sources of energy. We need to look to technology in our American legacy of innovation and research to help reduce our need on oil and gas, whether domestic or foreign. But that is not going to happen overnight. It is not going to happen even in the near term. But long term, clean coal technology, nuclear energy, even biofuels and wind energy can help reduce the strain on our gas supply by taking some of the energy load off  of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to be careful not to cherry-pick a few politically correct solutions. We have already seen the increase in the cost of food, in significant part because of food being used for fuel. Even with the best of intentions of an ethanol policy, it has created an impending crisis when it comes to using food for fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is time for us to take definitive steps to help reduce the cost of gasoline at the pump. We have some solutions, if we would get some cooperation on the other side of the aisle. Since the Democrats are now in charge, we would expect them to lead, to keep the promise that Speaker Pelosi made 2 years ago. We wish to help them come up with a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices. But continued obstruction, continued schizophrenia, and continued reliance  on politically correct solutions which sometimes end up backfiring is not the way forward. The American people are looking to us for a solution and it is high time we deliver.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400621" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to follow my colleague from Texas in pursuing that very same discussion on the issue of energy. I was here before the Presiding Officer joined the Senate and I remember daily diatribes about how Republicans being in charge was leading Americans to have higher gas prices. In fact, I recall a great deal being made about what the gas prices were then, when they reached $3 a gallon in April of 2006, and I recall a big show up here at the gas station on the corner,  right here on Capitol Hill, about how if Democrats were in charge, this wouldn't be happening; it was only because Republicans were in charge that gas prices had reached $3 a gallon. Now we are looking at a situation where they are $3.69 in April of 2008, 2 years later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats, as my colleague from Texas said, the House and the Senate leadership, with great enthusiasm, took control of both Houses of the Congress and promised the American people they would lower gas prices, they would change the dynamics, and they would deliver. We were promised an alternative to paying $3 a gallon. I don't think what they meant was to pay $4 a gallon, but it was an alternative to pay less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American families are hurting. AAA reports that today's price of $3.50 a gallon is the highest average price they have ever had on record. Families are paying record high gas prices and we still haven't passed a sensible energy policy that gets to the heart of this matter. Until that policy is passed, we ought to do what we can to offer Americans who are frustrated with the current prices some much needed relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, oil is nearly $120 a barrel. High fuel prices are translating into higher prices for groceries. What families need is relief. We need to do what we can to stem the rise of gasoline prices at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the ways I think we could do that and benefit our economy at the same time is a summer holiday from the 18-cent-a-gallon Federal gas tax. I have joined with several of my colleagues in supporting a gas tax holiday from Memorial Day to Labor Day. What a concept. Wouldn't it be nice. By suspending the gas tax 18 cents a gallon on gas and 24 cents on diesel, it would be putting money back into the pockets of American families. This would help those who have to drive great distances for work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many people in Florida who want to find affordable housing have to be a long ways from work. Florida doesn't have the kind of mass transit system many places in the Northeast and other parts of the country have. They have no option but to get in a car. When they do, they get hammered at the gas pump. People in the trucking industry are finding increasing problems in meeting their needs because diesel fuel costs are so high, so the cost of transporting goods is also going up. One of the things  that benefits my State greatly is when the American family jumps in their car and goes for a summer vacation. As the gas prices begin to hurt the pocketbook of the American family, fewer and fewer of them will have the joy of enjoying a vacation and more and more Floridians, already threatened by a weak economy, would have an additional problem of seeing vacationers not come to our attractions and beaches and maybe hurt our tourism economy as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Something else we can do is to seriously consider suspending the production of so-called boutique fuels. This is a requirement by States that mandate the use of different fuel blends to meet clean air standards. As States develop more and more requirements, the blends of fuel increase in number and now there are dozens of these fuel blends. Each one of them puts a strain on oil refineries which already are stretched to the max. States need to work to reduce the number of boutique fuels and increase  their cooperation with oil refineries to harmonize fuel blend requirements. In other words, we all want clean air, but every State's version of how we get there ought to not be an individual act, but ought to be harmonized so we can then shorten or lessen the number of additional fuel blends that have to be made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, we need to expand refinery capacity in this country. We haven't built a new refinery in 30 years, yet we keep saddling our fuel system with more and more mandates. We do need to find a way where we can create more avenues for refining fuel. Our industry refines approximately 18 million barrels a day, but we use over 20 million barrels a day. That means we have a shortfall between what we can refine, what we can actually do in that regard, and what must be imported from other parts  of the world. So as unthinkable as it is, the United States has to import refined fuel. We shouldn't be in that fix; we should be able to stay ahead of the demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need long-term solutions to our energy problems. There are alternative sources of fuel, such as cellulosic ethanol, where it is synthesized using agricultural waste,  biomass, and other byproducts that are renewable sources of energy and that do not compete with the food chain, which is an increasing problem we are finding. Florida could play a huge role in developing these fuels of the future and fuel technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was pleased that our energy bill last year included a very robust focus on these new emerging technologies that will require 21 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol by the year 2022. Florida has a real potential to be a leader in biomass production, and we are quickly becoming leaders in this field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So for the long term, we have taken some steps necessary to provide Americans with more alternatives to paying high gas prices at the pump, but more must be done. We must increase, where possible, more domestic production. We  need to also continue to expand avenues of research and opportunities for new fuel breakthroughs. I continue to believe that America's ingenuity is our greatest strength and we can look to ways in which we can utilize that ingenuity  to find ways so we might conquer this addiction, as it might be called, to refined fuel. We must do better. We also have to help the American family to get away from $3 and $4 a gallon for gasoline. It is time we find a way to help the American family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond that, I think there is one thing every American can do today, and that is to conserve. If we were to conserve fuel and do that in a significant way, I know we would lower the prices of gas, not only of fuel in the barrel but also at the pump. I think all Americans have an interest in conservation and we should seek and lead our people to do more and more conservation, because until we have alternative fuels available, this may be the very best way in which we can lower our fuel prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need leadership. We look for leadership from the majority party, and we hope part of that will include opening additional sources of exploration in America, where possible and where prudent, in compatibility with our environment; creating more options for fewer fuel blends, and more refining capacity; also, looking to cellulosic, but also conserving more energy.</paragraph>
