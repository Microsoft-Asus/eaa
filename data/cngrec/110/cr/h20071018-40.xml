  <narrative>CALLING FOR A SECURITY SUMMIT AT O'HARE AIRPORT -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11759]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kirk) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400222" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today's USA Today reports on a major security failure at two of our Nation's largest airports, Chicago's O'Hare and LAX. In a simulation conducted by the Transportation Security Agency, screeners at LAX missed 75 percent of hidden explosives and bomb parts carried through the security by undercover TSA agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Screeners at Chicago's O'Hare missed these items 60 percent of the time. According to the report, bomb materials were packed away in toiletry kits, briefcases and CD players. Now, more than 6 years after September 11, we have to fix the security failures at major hubs like O'Hare and LAX.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Security officials should call a security summit, bringing together local leaders and the Departments of Homeland Security and Transportation to schedule intensive retraining for TSA screeners, new testing standards, and accountability for lapses in security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much of our safety and a great deal of our economy depends on the security of O'Hare Airport. We can do this. And a security summit to fix this glaring security problem would help.</paragraph>
