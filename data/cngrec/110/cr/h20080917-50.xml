    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3019">H.R. 3019</bill>, the Expand and Preserve Home Ownership through Counseling Act. This important legislation establishes an office of housing counseling at the Department of Housing and Urban Development to carry out and to coordinate the responsibilities of the Department with respect to counseling on homeownership and rental housing issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House of Representatives has already approved this bipartisan bill in three separate measures that have passed during this Congress. They include <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill>, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007; <bill type="h" number="5830">H.R. 5830</bill>, the FHA Housing Stabilization and Home Ownership Retention Act of 2008; and the initial House version of <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Given that the Senate has yet to act upon this important housing counseling measure, it is important that the House pass this legislation as a stand-alone bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HUD's current Housing Counseling Program authorizes HUD to provide or contract with organizations to provide counseling and advice to tenants, homeowners and low and moderate income families on a range of housing issues. However, the current program lacks the stature, organization and prominence in the Department to help ensure that its counseling activities are high quality, widely available and well-coordinated within other Department activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the midst of this foreclosure crisis, this extraordinary crisis we are going through at this very moment in our financial markets, there can be no doubt that housing counseling, whether it is pre-purchase or post-purchase, is a vital component of the homeownership process, and I urge this House to support this bill, which will create an Office of Housing Counseling at HUD to better focus the Department's resources in this area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, specifically this bill will do the following: It establishes an Office of Housing Counseling to carry out and coordinate the responsibilities of the Department with respect to counseling on homeownership and rental housing issues; it will require and facilitate the coordination of HUD's homeownership and rental housing counseling programs, including programs targeted at low and moderate income individuals, the homeless and senior citizens; it will require the launch of a national public  service multi-media campaign to promote housing counseling, including the establishment of a Web site and toll-free hotline; and it will authorize the assurance of homeownership and rental housing counseling grants to HUD-certified State, local and nonprofit organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important and critical piece of legislation, and much needed, for all we know that the need for housing counseling far outstrips its current availability. The enactment of <bill type="h" number="3019">H.R. 3019</bill> is a major step in addressing this need in a very comprehensive, thorough, efficient and effective manner, and I urge this full House to support this very important bipartisan home counseling legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as the author of <bill type="h" number="3019">H.R. 3019</bill>, the Expand and Preserve Home Ownership Through Counseling Act, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. First let me thank Congressman Ruben Hinojosa for being the lead Democrat on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, we founded the House Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus, which is now over 75 members strong, and we have been working together on this issue for a very long time. This bill is just one more example of how financial literacy can promote economic security and empower Americans to make more informed decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, I would like to thank Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus for their support for this legislation. Both the chairman and ranking member have included the language of this bill in various mortgage and housing packages, two of which, as Mr. Scott said, have previously passed the House but not the other Chamber. The first time was in November of 2007, and the second time was in <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, and that bill passed the House on May 8 of this year. Unfortunately,  the Senate has not yet acted on this important legislation. It is my hope that the Senate will consider the bill as a stand-alone measure and send it to the President's desk before we adjourn this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What does the bill do? Well, it elevates housing counseling within the Department of Housing and Urban Development by establishing an Office of Housing Counseling and a director of that office who reports directly to the Secretary of HUD. The office will be tasked with carrying out and coordinating HUD's Home Ownership and Housing Rental Counseling Program, targeted at low and moderate income individuals, the homeless and the seniors, just to name a few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More specifically, the bill authorizes $180 million over the next 4 years for HUD to operate this office, offer grants to State and local counseling agencies and launch a national outreach campaign. The bill also calls for the office to provide a report to Congress on the root causes of defaults and foreclosures, including recommendations for policy reforms and best practices, as well as identification of populations most in need of counseling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, counseling can help guide homeowners into a loan that best meets their budgets and needs, steering them way from possible foreclosure down the road. Housing counseling, one form of financial literacy, is often the first line of defense that first-time home buyers have against predatory lending practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, counselors can save the homes of borrowers currently facing foreclosure. So many troubled mortgage holders genuinely want to pay for their home and had solid payment histories before their rates were reset. These are people that if given the right refinancing options, can and would be able to make their monthly payments. But they need someone to help them evaluate their options, guide them through the process and facilitate discussions with their current lenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing that we have learned during this downturn in the housing market is that many Americans need to better understand the terms of financial products, including and especially mortgages. Education is one of the most important tools in our arsenal to keep our economy and American families on sound financial footing. It is my hope that by providing greater access to home counseling services, we can help to prevent a repeat performance of the recent housing bubble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to conclude today by thanking the folks at the DuPage Homeownership Center of Northern Will County in Illinois. They have helped so many residents of the 13th Congressional District of Illinois to secure sound mortgages or avoid foreclosure. And I would like to thank all the counselors and organizations across the country that are now involved in the HOPE NOW initiative, which reported last month it had helped over 2 million homeowners to avoid foreclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I would urge my colleagues to support the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we conclude this, let me state the appreciation this entire Congress has for the distinguished leadership of Mrs. Biggert on this issue. She has been a pioneer in financial literacy. She has committed a tremendous amount of her time and energy to this bill and to other bills. I want to commend her for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another bill which she has provided leadership on has been a financial literacy bill of utmost importance as we see now, and that is K through 12th grade literacy programs, to get them into our schools. I think it is very important for all of us here to know, and the Nation to know, that Mrs. Biggert has provided sterling leadership on this entire issue of financial literacy. I certainly want to say how appreciative we all are for that leadership, Mrs. Biggert.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It points out, Mr. Speaker, as we look at where we are today with the downturn of the financial markets, the meltdown of our mortgage industry, at the core of it as we peel back the reasons and the causes we will all find and come to the conclusion that we have a tremendous need for financial literacy and financial education, because the core of our problem is that there are so many complicated and complex entities involved in financing, that we as a nation are coming up short on financial literacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To you, Mrs. Biggert, I thank you for your leadership on this. It has indeed been a pleasure working with you on this subject, and this bill is a testimonial to your leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for his very kind words. I really appreciate it. He is a wonderful member of the Financial Services Committee and is always there and always knows what is going on and always participates and does a good job. I thank you for all your work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of of <bill type="h" number="3019">H.R. 3019</bill>, to expand and preserve home ownership through counseling, introduced by my colleague from Illinois, Representative Biggert. This important legislation will amend the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act to establish an Office of Housing Counseling which will conduct activities relating to homeownership and rental housing counseling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the crisis in the mortgage industry began, it primarily hit subprime borrowers. As the foreclosure crisis endured, home values started declining and eventually affected homeowners who are considered to be prime borrowers. This amendment to the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 will require a number of different stipulations that will encourage the expansion of home ownership with adequate information to make an informed decision. These stipulations include:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Directing the Office of the Secretary to establish, coordinate, and monitor Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administration of homeownership and rental housing counseling procedures provided in connection with any HUB program, including all related requirements, standards, and performance measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Requiring the Office of the Secretary to provide certification for various computer software programs for consumers to use in evaluating different residential mortgage loan proposals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Encouraging the Director of Housing Counseling to develop, implement, and conduct national public service multimedia campaigns designed to make potential homeowners aware that counseling is available from unbiased and reliable sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Requiring the Secretary to provide technical and financial assistance to State governments, local governments, and non-profit organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Directing the Secretary to study and report to Congress the root cause of default and foreclosure on homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amending the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 to revise requirements for HUD booklets designed to help consumers applying for federally related mortgage loans to understand the nature of real estate settlement services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Problematic, unaffordable subprime loans are more often issued to African-American and Latino homebuyers. Nationally, African-American home purchasers were 2.7 times more likely to be issued a high cost loan than white borrowers. Latinos were 2.3 times more likely to be issued a high cost home purchase loan than white borrowers. Similarly, for refinance loans, African-Americans were 1.8 times more likely to be issued a high cost loan than whites. Latinos were 1.4 times more likely to be burdened  with a high refinance cost loan than white homeowners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These racial disparities persist even among homeowners of the same income level. In comparative terms, upper-income African-Americans were 3.3 times more likely than upper-income whites to be issued a high cost loan when purchasing a home. Upper-income Latinos were 3 times more likely than upper-income whites to be issued a high cost loan when purchasing a home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's lower-income and minority communities receive a disproportionate number of subprime loans and are therefore most exposed to experience default and foreclosure. Based on public data for 2006 available under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), this report examines the extent of high-cost lending for 172 metropolitan areas, determines the disparities between borrowers of various races and income levels and identifies metropolitan areas that are at highest risk of facing concentrated  foreclosures</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I firmly believe that we must pass this legislation in order to create equal terms and equal information for every homeowner or potential homeowner in America. This legislation will ensure that information is equally available to all homebuyers and enable every person to have a fair chance to obtain the information necessary to make informed financial decisions. There is a disparity of information in our current mortgage system and <bill type="h" number="3019">H.R. 3019</bill> will enable the Government to alleviate this disparity  by improving the flow of information through house owner counseling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="3019">H.R. 3019</bill> as well, as together we search for solutions that will help constituents throughout the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="3019">H.R. 3019</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
