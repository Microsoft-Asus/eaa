  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to commend William D. Wagoner of Royal Oak, MI, who last week retired from a long and distinguished career in public service. For the past 35 years, Dr. Wagoner dedicated his career to the public good, working to establish innovative and sustainable practices in urban planning, emergency management, and teaching the next generation of planners and emergency responders. His extraordinary career spanned the entire spectrum of government service,  from the local level to the Federal level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Wagoner began his career in service by teaching history and political science at a public high school in Clarkston, MI. He went on to earn his master's degree in urban planning and his doctorate in public administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 18 productive years, he served as assistant city manager in Berkley, MI, a large suburb of Detroit, and for the past 16 years has been director of planning and community development for Livingston County, the fastest growing county in Michigan. Dr. Wagoner has written several books on urban planning and emergency response, and has served for decades as an instructor for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Kennedy asked a generation of Americans to give of themselves for our country and for its future. Dr. Wagoner answered President Kennedy's call and has inspired countless others, who have worked with him or who have been his students, to do the same. I congratulate Dr. Wagoner for his remarkable public service, and I wish him a long and healthy and happy retirement. He has served America well.</paragraph>
