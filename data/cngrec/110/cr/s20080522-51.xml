    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to recognize the contributions of a community leader from my home State of Pennsylvania, Mr. L. Robert Kimball. Bob Kimball's name has become synonymous with high-quality work that clients have come to expect from the architecture, engineering, technology, and consulting firm that he founded 55 years ago in his home town of Ebensburg, PA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The firm's professional services are well known both in Cambria County and among the public and private marketplaces it serves. Far less recognized are the contributions that Bob makes to his community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his involvement on the boards of various civic, higher education, and professional organizations, his support extends to the fine and performing arts, education, athletics, youth organizations, community economic development initiatives, and health and human service agencies. His generosity is not limited to monetary contributions and sponsorships. He also encourages active participation by his staff in community activities. Bob wants to make sure that his firm never forgets its  small-town foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under his leadership as founder, Bob places a high priority on treating clients, staff, and the community with consideration, appreciation, and fairness. These core values are among the key components of the firm's success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob Kimball has enjoyed a successful career and has continuously shared that success, experience, and guidance with the community in Cambria County. He has distinguished himself as a  business leader, an accomplished professional engineer, a successful entrepreneur, and a dedicated family man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the United States Senate, we recognize Mr. L. Robert Kimball's commitment to his community in Ebensburg, PA.</paragraph>
