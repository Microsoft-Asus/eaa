  <narrative>NATIONAL ALCOHOL AWARENESS MONTH -- (Senate - April 09, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="2813">S2813</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300058" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I rise to recognize April as National Alcohol Awareness Month. We must all remain aware that alcohol is a drug that can pose serious health and well-being risks if used improperly. From underage drinking to drunk driving to alcohol addiction, this substance can have catastrophic and long-reaching effects on the lives of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to take the opportunity in a month dedicated to alcohol awareness to promote awareness of a devastating alcohol-related condition. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, FASD, is an umbrella term describing the varied range of alcohol-related birth defects that may result from the use of alcohol during pregnancy. The effects of this disorder may be mental, behavioral, and/or involve learning disabilities. FASD is the leading known cause of preventable cognitive impairment in America. It is  estimated FASD effects 1 in 100 live births each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must move past the stigma of this devastating disease to truly help those and their families who are affected by FASD get the health, education, counseling and support services they need and deserve. We must also address the tragedy of FASD at the source, by increasing awareness that any amount of alcohol during pregnancy can have heartbreaking, lifelong effects, and by ensuring this is understood by all women of child-bearing age and by providing treatment and counseling services for these  women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, several of my colleagues and I reintroduced legislation to address FASD issues within families, at schools, in health care centers, in our legal system, and at its source. In addition to supporting those living with FASD and their families, this bill works to educate our health practitioners, educators and members of our judicial system to recognize the special needs of these individuals. While we increase awareness of the effects alcohol can have on individuals and their families,  increasing FASD awareness must also be included to advance the fight against these damaging disorders.</paragraph>
