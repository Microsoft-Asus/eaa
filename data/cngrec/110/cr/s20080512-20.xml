  <narrative>CORRUPTION IN IRAQ -- (Senate - May 12, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4005">S4005</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am going to speak about energy and respond to a couple of things I heard on the Senate floor and talk about what we are going to be doing tomorrow. But first let me say I finished 2 hours of chairing a Democratic policy committee hearing in which three people testified: two previously serving with the U.S. State Department in the country of Iraq, and one, Major General Nash, who has a great deal of experience internationally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come away from that hearing after listening 2 hours to some very patriotic Americans, Judge Brennan and Mr. Mattil, who talked about their experience working for the State Department in Baghdad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I heard was unbelievable--almost unbelievable. They were there to try to be supportive of the anticorruption efforts that were underway by our Government and by Judge Radhi al-Radhi, who headed the Commission on Public Integrity in the country of Iraq. What they told me makes me almost furious.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They told me our State Department--yes, our State Department here in the United States--did everything they could to undermine the efforts of Judge al-Radhi and the Commission on Public Integrity and the section in the State Department that was in Iraq trying to root out corruption and support those who were engaged in anticorruption activity. Billions and billions of dollars have literally been stolen. The witnesses today who worked for our State Department in Iraq told us money that has gone  through the hands of the Iraqi Ministries, an unbelievably corrupt government, ends up in the hands, among other places, of the insurgents, which then fuels the war against our soldiers. Our State Department, they say in testimony--and I encourage people to write to us and get a copy of this testimony--they say</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a man whom they tried to kill. They didn't like him investigating corruption in Iraq so they tried to kill him. Yet our Government paved the way for the Iraqi Government to get rid of him, to throw him out of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Thursday of this week we are going to write a bill in the Appropriations Committee. I believe the President asks for $172 billion--that is with a "b"--$172 billion additional, mostly for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. The question is, how much of that $127 billion going through our Defense Department and then coming into the Iraqi Ministries, how much of that is going to be wasted? How much of that is going to stick in the hands of corrupt officials in the country of Iraq?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we could dye that money purple and track it through those who stuff it in their pockets in Iraqi Ministries and then pass it along to the insurgents as part of the take, who would we see stealing this money from the American taxpayers, and who would we see undermining the work, every day, of soldiers in Iraq?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can't leave the country of Iraq, we are told by this administration, until there is stability. There is not going to be stability until we address the issue of corruption. As long as we will turn a blind eye to corruption--which two people from the State Department who worked in Iraq told us today--as long as we turn a blind eye to corruption, which has been done; as long as we betray--yes, betray--those who were standing up in Iraq and risking their lives to get rid of corruption, we don't  stand a chance of making an inch of ground in Iraq. In fact, the witnesses today said the Special Inspector General in Iraq, in reporting to us, the Congress, and the American people about progress made in routing out corruption, that Special Inspector General was given information from those</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are not even getting the truth. We are being deceived. I want everyone to read the testimony that came today from Judge Brennan and others and understand what is happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we start on Thursday on this issue of whether we are going to provide another $172 billion, we ought to understand how much of that money is being stolen, how much of that money is going to actually support the insurgency, and what is being done about it. I am going to send letters, as a result of the hearing that I and my colleagues held today, to officials in the State Department, to Secretary Rice, and others demanding to know what she knows and what they know and who is doing something  about this and demanding accountability from those in the State Department relative to the testimony that was given today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I didn't come to talk about that, but I just came from chairing that hearing for 2 hours. It is an unbelievable tale that is very distressing and very disappointing and just cries out for action by the Congress and action by the President and this administration.</paragraph>
