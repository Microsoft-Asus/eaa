  <speaking speaker="400283" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Republican Party and the President will make it clear today to the American people that they own this war; hook, line and sinker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President and his Republican colleagues will be successful today in continuing the Iraq war, but this is a pyrrhic victory at best. The Democratic leadership is allowing this bill to pass because, unlike the President, they will not leave our troops unprotected in battle. It is our troops and their families that are the only ones being asked to make any sacrifice in this war, and this President's policy is unworthy of their sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only sacrifice requested of the rest of us has been to go out and spend our tax cuts at the mall. Meanwhile, the Iraqi parliament is preparing to take the summer off, probably using some of the missing $9 billion to sunbathe along the Mediterranean. Our soldiers risk life and limb to secure their country, which is in the midst of a civil war, and they go on vacation. Ask yourself if you think this is a war worthy of our soldiers' sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We Democrats will do everything, legally and legislatively, to bring our troops home as soon and as safely as possible. That is our pledge to the American people, and we will keep it.</paragraph>
