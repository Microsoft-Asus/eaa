    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased and proud to recognize the pastor of my hometown church in Somerset, Kentucky, Dr. French Harmon, who presides over the First Baptist Church, Somerset, Kentucky, where he has a valuable lesson for his congregation, which I am now proud to briefly repeat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He says three important words every Sunday: celebrate, connect, and care. Dr. Harmon reminds us to celebrate Jesus Christ and what he sacrificed for us. He tells us to connect with one another in our communities, at work, and at home. And he tells us to care about our fellow human beings, whether friends, strangers or mere acquaintances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Congress goes about the people's business in this Chamber, let these words guide us as we strive to make the country a better place. As we press ahead with the issues of our time, let's follow the most basic lessons of our faiths that teach us to do right by others. Let's remember the higher power that we answer to and to whom we are ultimately accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud of my hometown pastor who reminds me of what really counts, what's really important, and why we are here. Dr. Harmon is a leader. He has grown his congregation 50 percent to 600 over just the last year. He coaches little league baseball, he leads prayer breakfasts at the local chamber of commerce, just as he did yesterday at the National Prayer Breakfast here in Washington. He celebrates, connects, and cares, not just on Sunday but every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Dr. French Harmon. His wife, Rachel, and three children and Rachel's parents are with him here in Washington.</paragraph>
