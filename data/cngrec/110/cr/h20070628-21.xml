  <speaking speaker="412189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, since I've been here in Washington, in January, this Congress, under strong Democratic leadership, is making progress on the American people's priorities, despite intense opposition on many issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In spite of this opposition, Democrats have succeeded by increasing pay for 13  million workers, raising the minimum wage for the first time in a decade, by providing overdue assistance to the gulf region hit hard by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, by protecting our troops, investing in military readiness, including armed vehicles and equipment, and by increasing the transparency and accountability with strengthened ethics and lobbying rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also continue moving legislation that has already passed here in the House but is making its way through the system, including fully implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations, putting 50,000 more police officers on our streets, and by providing the largest increase in veterans health care funding in the Veterans Administration's 77-year history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this new Democratic Congress has begun moving our Nation in a new direction to address the needs of all Americans.</paragraph>
