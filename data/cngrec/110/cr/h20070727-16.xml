  <speaking speaker="400154" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my amendment streamlines and adopts one set of terms and conditions for easements for the Wetlands Reserve Program, the Grasslands Reserve Program, the Farmland and Ranchland Protection Program, and the Healthy Forest Reserve Program. This greatly simplifies the process for the Department to purchase easements, while leaving functions of the programs intact. It allows for one set of rules on titleholders, establishment of easements, type of deeds, acceptance of contributions,  title transfer and reversionary interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment not only helps the Department to reduce inefficiencies which result in administrative costs, but will help producers by simplifying the process of obtaining easements for these programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment does not consolidate any program. This simply sets up one set of rules and regulations for easements. Each program has its own application process, sign-up period, and administrative requirements. Countless hours are wasted on administrative work because each easement has its own set of rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment makes an effort at streamlining these complex rules and regulations into one set of rules with flexibility that is simple and makes common sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each of these individual programs retains their own mission. These easement programs are implemented through landowners who voluntarily agree to a deed restriction and some landscape and resource restoration. Making the sign-up process for producers easier will allow NRCS to focus on their true mission, which should be to provide technical assistance to producers wanting to implement voluntary conservation methods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have taken popular components of the Farmland and Ranchland Protection Program, including the ability of third-party entities to hold easements, and implemented them in a manner that all producers interested in easements will be able to enjoy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment keeps the funding and missions of each easement program intact. The amendment even keeps the appraisal method of each program intact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a commonsense amendment, a good government amendment, and a producer-friendly amendment. And I ask for your support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400316" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I've been working with the gentleman from Virginia on this issue, and I think he has some good ideas here that we have been working through, but we just aren't at the point where we're comfortable on this side at this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I could engage in a conversation with the gentleman, as he knows, I think that some of the elements of this are something that we should do. It's just, as I said, we're not there yet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, as you know, I have an interest in looking at this issue of NRCS doing administrative work within their agency. We've been talking about that as well. I still believe that it would be better if we transferred that function over to FSA like they're doing now at CRP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So if the gentleman would agree, I am very much interested in working with him on this issue. I think we can get something accomplished over the next period of time until we end up in conference with the Senate. So if the gentleman would be willing to withdraw, I will make the commitment that we will work on this in a serious way, because I think we can get something done here.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400154" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400316" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would be glad to yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400154" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for his comments. He and I have had discussions about this, and I think we are in agreement that there needs to be significant reform of these programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I've shared with the gentleman and others, there are farmers in my district and elsewhere around the country who are very frustrated with signing up for these programs. And, quite frankly, it is counterproductive to have programs that are so complex, that require so much paperwork, that require you to apply in several different places. One farmer, a woman in my district, has done a fantastic job of attempting to utilize these programs, but the frustration, the cost, the amount of time involved  discouraged her, as it has discouraged others from even initiating the process to participate. And therefore, I think it's in the interest of the stakeholders, the groups who want to see more of these easements taken up, to make it an easier process. And that includes not only streamlining the definition of easements in this amendment, but looking  at whether some of these programs can be made to work together better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentleman's seriousness about undertaking this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I understand that the CBO has determined that my amendment violates the PAYGO rules. As such, I would like to engage the chairman of the Agriculture Committee and the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee in a colloquy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you both well know, buried within the authorization of the Homeland Security Department was a little-known provision that mandated the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's 1,800 agricultural inspectors move from USDA to the newly created Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection Division.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This move was made in order to consolidate custom and border enforcement into one agency, a decision I'm sure was made with all good intentions in mind. However, as the GAO has recently reported, since the transfer of these USDA employees, Customs and Border Protection has not developed sufficient performance measures to take into account the agency's expanded mission or to consider all pathways by which prohibited agricultural items or foreign pests may enter the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this deficiency in our border security cannot and should not be tolerated. Stopping foreign pests and prohibited agricultural products from entering the United States might not be as sexy as stopping terrorists, weapons, or drugs, but it is certainly as important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are six-legged terrorists, Mr. Chairman, that can wreak havoc on our Nation's agricultural industry, costing billions of taxpayer dollars in eradication efforts and decimate our ability to access new export markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like your assurances that by withdrawing this amendment I have the commitment from both of you to work with me on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I certainly would prefer to see these employees moved immediately back to USDA, where I believe they belong, my greater concern is that wherever they are right now, they must certainly have the tools and resources at their disposal to do their job effectively and efficiently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to have a hearing on the staffing, training and morale problems that persist within the agency. I also believe that we should direct USDA and the Department of Homeland Security to develop standardized, reputable  training programs that properly identify and assess the major threats posed by foreign agricultural pests and disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe USDA and Homeland Security should be required to fully and accurately account for all agricultural quarantine inspection fees. But perhaps most importantly, I want this issue to have the attention it deserves from both Agriculture and Homeland Security Committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Preventing pest and disease infestation is a paramount concern to all of American agriculture, but primarily to our specialty crop industry. I have vowed to fight for them on this issue and would appreciate your help in ensuring their concerns are met.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to assure the gentleman from California that, as Chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, I look forward to working with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The border issue, from a security standpoint, as you know, is a major issue. Customs and Border Patrol should have more training in this area. I look forward to joint hearings with the Agriculture Committee on this, and subsequent to the findings of those hearings, look forward to strengthening our borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must express my reservations to using the farm bill as a legislative vehicle to transfer agriculture import inspectors from the Department of Homeland Security to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Congress, in March of 2003 consolidated and transferred critical responsibility for inspections of passenger and agricultural commodities from USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the transfer of APHIS inspectors to DHS, DHS had dedicated considerable resources to enhancing agriculture inspections to protect the nation from economically devastating agricultural pests and diseases. I agree that the Department of Homeland Security, especially Customs and Border Protection, must improve its training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While DHS has experienced some challenges in implementing this enhanced inspection regime, those challenges are not insurmountable. As a former Agriculture Committee Member and representing many agriculture interests, I am very concerned about any breaches at the border, including foreign pest and prohibited agricultural products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though DHS carries out the inspections, USDA maintains the responsibility for establishing the regulations, guidelines, and even the training that govern the import of agricultural products. Thus, it is important to note that the success or failure of the program requires both DHS and USDA coordinated efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Transferring employees at this time would divert attention from the real mission, delay any efforts to identify needed improvements, and set the program back for another several years while yet another readjustment occurs for both USDA and DHS. A far better approach than another disruptive, time-consuming transfer of thousands of employees would be for USDA and DHS to commit to conducting a thorough analysis of the program's performance, agree to a specific action plan for improvements, and to  set clear and measurable goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman and Mr. Cardoza, I am committed to working with you on this issue and would like to hold a joint hearing on this matter. I thank the gentleman for raising this important issue and look forward to working with you and Chairman Peterson immediately on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May 22, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON: We write to you today regarding the recent consideration given to the proposed removal of the agricultural inspection function from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and relocation of this function to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), as included in <bill type="s" number="887">S. 887</bill> and other legislation pending in Congress. USDA and DHS oppose this legislative proposal. We both  take seriously the shared mission of protecting our Nation from foreign plant and animal diseases, as well as securing our homeland against unintentional and intentional threats to our agriculture and food supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The creation of DHS was a thoughtful complex, and ambitious integration effort. We strongly believe that Congress, which recently mandated an extensive internal reorganization of DHS, should now give DHS the organizational stability it needs to succeed with its vital homeland security mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>USDA, DHS, and our agriculture stakeholders all share a common goal--protecting American agriculture. However, both USDA and DHS strongly believe that another disruptive, time-consuming transfer of thousands of employees and the agricultural inspection function, as advocated by some, would degrade enforcement and seriously undermine the integrated border enforcement capabilities created with the formation of DHS. A transfer would divert attention from the real mission to prevent the entry of  harmful plant and animal pests, disease, and threats to our agricultural resources and food supply. A transfer would delay efforts to identify needed improvements in agricultural inspection and would therefore set the agricultural inspection program back while also creating counterproductive</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 1, 2003, the responsibility for the inspection of goods and travelers for illegal agricultural products or pests arriving in the United States was transferred from USDA to the then-newly created CBP within DHS. The transfer of this function was among the first steps in establishing CBP as the single, unified agency responsible for managing and securing our Nation's ports-of-entry. Another important part of the creation of CBP was the development of two new positions to respond to new  and expanded border security needs: the CBP Officer and the CBP Agriculture Specialist (CBPAS).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CBP Officers are responsible for a wide range of duties including preventing the entry of terrorists and their weapons and conducting traditional inspection activities related to trade, contraband enforcement, and admissibility--as well as the important agricultural inspection function. In this regard, CBP Officers receive specialized cross-training related to agricultural risk and inspection referral. CBPASs fill the role of the former APHIS inspectors and conduct activities to prevent harmful  plant and animal pests and diseases from entering the United States while guarding against agro/bio-terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, CBP Agriculture Specialists receive the same amount of agriculture-specific training as they did when they were part of USDA. The eight weeks of agriculture-specific training that CBPASs receive, conducted by USDA instructors, ensures that they are fully prepared for their role at the border. In addition to traditional agricultural enforcement, CBPASs play a crucial role in educating other CBP officers about the agricultural inspection process, thus enhancing the agricultural knowledge  of all personnel at ports-of-entry. Importantly, CBP has increased CBPAS staffing in the field by over 30 percent, providing coverage at over 157 ports-of-entry since the merger on March 1, 2003. The deployment of both CBPASs (over 2,000) and cross-trained CBP Officers</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the creation of CBP, USDA continued to retain the majority of agricultural functions, including responsibility for establishing regulations and guidelines that govern the import of agricultural products, pest identification, inspection of propagative material, risk assessment, and methods development. CBP, of course, retained border inspection responsibilities. While USDA continues to establish agricultural policy governing imports, it is the significant cooperation between the two Departments  that has enabled the agricultural inspection program to advance and meet the new challenges of the growing global marketplace. USDA and DHS have worked tirelessly to integrate the important duties and responsibilities of the scientific mission of agricultural inspection with CBP's other missions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American agriculture remains at risk from external threats. Our joint efforts must continue to prepare us for the threat of unintentional or intentional introduction of foreign plant or animal pests or pathogens into our country. These potential threats could devastate American crops or livestock, which is why the incorporation of the two CBP line positions plays such an important role in DHS's multi-layered approach to protect U.S. agricultural resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>USDA and DHS are committed to working in partnership to safeguard American agriculture by detecting and preventing harmful plant and animal pests and diseases through training initiatives, trend analysis, targeting initiatives, and the development of special programs like the National Agriculture Release Program. As part of this commitment, USDA and DHS are forming a task force to address the concerns of our agriculture stakeholders, as well as issues raised about the agricultural inspection  program in reports from the Government Accountability Office and USDA's Office of the Inspector General. Through this task force, USDA and DHS will take important steps to continue to improve the program by conducting a thorough analysis of the program's performance, agreeing to a specific action plan for improvements, and setting clear and measurable goals to hold the agencies accountable for protecting America</paragraph>

And we really do need to make sure that this function of the Department is operating in the fashion that it was operating  when it was under the control of the Department of Agriculture, that we're not losing people with the kind of expertise that's necessary to be able to detect and keep these pests out of the country.

  <chair>Amendment No. 6 offered by Mr. Boustany:</chair>
  <chair> At the end of subtitle A of title XI, add the following new section:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 11013. DETERMINATION OF CERTAIN SWEET POTATO PRODUCTION.</chair>
  <chair> In the case of sweet potatoes, Risk Management Agency Pilot Program data shall not be considered for purposes of determining production for the 2005-2006 Farm Service Agency Crop Disaster Program.&lt;p&gt;</chair>

  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Goodlatte, the Democratic staff of the committee and the Republican staff of the committee for working with my staffer, Michael Hare, on this amendment. I think it's a very important amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to offer this with my colleague and good friend, Mr. Alexander, from Louisiana as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sweet potato farmers throughout the Nation are involved in an insurance pilot program being administered by the Risk Management Agency. This is a multi-year process which involves many adjustments along the way. The biggest problem was a change made by RMA that defines what qualifies as a marketable sweet potato.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new definition of the term "marketable" includes all sweet potatoes over 1 1/2  inches in diameter. Unfortunately, this definition does not allow for any sweet potato that has been ruined and is considered unmarketable from being deducted from the total yield calculation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sweet potato farmers in Louisiana, as well as in many other parts of the country, suffered heavy rains in September and October of 2005. While these heavy rains led to significant yield losses, sweet potatoes that were over 1 1/2  inches in diameter were counted as a part of the total yield. By counting the sweet potatoes ruined by heavy rains, farmers were unable to qualify for disaster payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment would simply use the data collected by the local FSA offices instead of the RMA to be used for the purposes of determining crop losses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>These local offices already have the production yield information for the 2005-2006 crop year and will be able to certify if a sweet potato farmer is eligible, indeed, for disaster payment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to be clear: this amendment will only apply to farmers who purchased crop insurance and had a 35 percent crop loss. This amendment simply corrects a technical error made by RMA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge that we support our sweet potato farmers and adopt this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>As I said, I support the gentleman's amendment. I understand the gentleman's frustration with RMA and how it is on operating this crop insurance program for sweet potatoes. We have similar frustrations in our area in some other projects that we have been working on. I have heard from many of my farmers about this as well. That is why once we finish this farm bill, the committee is going to conduct a thorough, top-to-bottom review of all our operations down at USDA, especially at RMA.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me acknowledge the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Peterson, and the ranking member, Mr. Goodlatte. I, too, was trying to yield to the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. But I am sure that we will have an affirmation, hopefully, of the spirit of this amendment and ask my colleagues before I start to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to affirm family farmers around America. I rise proudly to acknowledge the importance of family farmers and the American agricultural industry in feeding not only America, but feeding the world. This bill, in particular, does a great amount as relates to improving nutrition, providing food for hungry children, and, of course, serving the world, particularly those in need of food.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It goes a long way in providing for black farmers and those who are socially disadvantaged or have land that needs conservation or needs the sharing of technology. I look forward to working with the chairman on those issues as we move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I rise today to offer an amendment that reaffirms the importance of nutritious meals for our young people, and the importance of the young people who eat school breakfasts and school lunches to have nutritious meals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This map may not necessarily speak to the idea of school lunches and school breakfasts, but the vastness of this map shows how big America is and the number of people on food stamps. You can imagine that the number of people on food stamps have children who go to school in need of a school breakfast and a school lunch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obesity in America is a health crisis. My amendment simply asks that we reaffirm, as a Congress, that those school lunches and those school breakfasts will be nutritionally based to overcome juvenile obesity and to ensure nutritious meals.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, childhood obesity is a growing problem in our country. We already know that obesity leads to a greater risk of heart disease, diabetes and a host of other cardiovascular problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to data from a California physical fitness testing program, among fifth, seventh and eighth graders in Los Angeles County public schools, 22 percent of students are overweight. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Los Angeles high schools, 16 percent of students were overweight and 18 percent are at risk of becoming overweight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this alarming trend in childhood obesity is not only a problem for Los Angeles, but for our Nation. Seventeen percent of our Nation's children aged 12 through 19 are overweight. Overweight children and adolescents are more likely to become obese as adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we want to reverse this trend and effectively reduce childhood obesity, we need to ensure that school breakfasts and school lunch programs clearly communicate the dangers of obesity and the importance of nutrition and physical fitness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased that the Chair has agreed to take the Jackson-Lee amendment to underscore the importance of this issue.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me quickly say this amendment is supported by the National Farmers Union, and it is a sense of Congress that food items provided pursuant to the Federal School Breakfast Program and School Lunch Program should be selected so as to reduce the incidence of juvenile obesity and to maximize nutritional value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Very quickly, African American and Hispanic families have the greatest risk for overweight and obesity, and youngsters from lower-income families have a higher risk for obesity than those from higher income. More than 40 percent of African American teenagers are overweight. Nearly 25 percent are obese. Hispanic children have the highest lifetime risk of diabetes, 52 percent for boys, 45 percent for girls, followed closely by African American children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This would be a very crucial statement made by this body, a bipartisan statement, that we not only support America's farmers, but we support the nutritional eating of our children in programs that are federally funded. I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment because obesity is at epidemic proportion in America; and I look forward to working with this committee as we promote nutrition, not only in the United States, but around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I ask for support of this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2419">H.R. 2419</bill>, the Farm Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007, the Farm Bill. Let me first thank my distinguished colleague Chairman Peterson for his extraordinary leadership and guidance in crafting this bill. The Farm Bill will go a long way to feed the hungry, increase access to childcare for low-income parents, help the environment, increase opportunities for alternative energy and promote healthy food choices. <bill type="h" number="2419">H.R. 2419</bill> will play a crucial role in continuing  to provide a strong support system for many of this Nation's neediest families. <bill type="h" number="2419">H.R. 2419</bill> reauthorizes nutrition programs, which account for two thirds of the bill's funding, to help low income families in need. This includes the extremely important Food Stamp Program that keeps many Americans from going hungry. In fact, the Farm Bill increases the minimum benefit under the Food Stamp</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation makes historic investments in programs to support fruit and vegetable producers who have not received traditional Farm Bill benefits. The bill provides $1.6 billion in funding for fruit and vegetable programs, including nutrition, research, pest management and trade promotion programs. It increases and expands the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Snack Program to schools in all 50 States and allows Senior Farmers Markets to expand six-fold. The bill provides mandatory funding for organic  certification cost share and authorizes a new incentive payment program for farmers wanting to convert to organic production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the nutrition section of the <bill type="h" number="2419">H.R. 2419</bill> will go a long way to combat the obesity crisis in this country. Emphasizing the importance of nutrition in this bill will give us some hope that we can find very real solutions to curtail the increasing rates of obesity in our communities and the extremely serious health consequences that result from these high obesity rates. In fact, that is why I offered an amendment to the Farm Bill. My amendment is simple but makes an important contribution  to the legislation. The amendment, which is strongly supported by the National Farmer's Union, simply provides that: "It is the sense of the Congress that food items provided pursuant to the Federal school breakfast and school lunch program should be selected so as to reduce the incidence of juvenile obesity and to maximize nutritional value."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, we cannot wait any longer to provide every opportunity for our children to receive nutritious meals and, in turn, reverse the alarming rates of childhood obesity. Although the obesity rates among all Americans are alarming, the obesity rates among African- American and Latino communities are particularly astonishing. As chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I have a special concern to bring attention to the childhood obesity epidemic  among African-Americans and Latino communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, my office in concert with the office of Congressman Edolphus Towns and the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, held a widely-attended issue forum entitled, "Childhood Obesity: Factors That Are Contributing to the Disproportionate Prevalence in Low Income Communities." At this forum, a panel of professionals from medicine, academia and research, nutrition, and the food industry discussed the disturbing increasing rates of childhood obesity in minority and low-income  communities, and the factors that are contributing to the prevalence in these communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we know is that our children are consuming less nutritious foods and that they do not get sufficient physical exercise. This combination has led to the obesity epidemic as well as various directly-related consequences. We must find ways to remove them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consider these facts:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obesity is widely recognized as one of the most pressing health threats to children and families across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, one-third of American children and adolescents are either obese or at risk of becoming obese.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are serious health implications associated with obesity for children, including increased risk for developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, orthopedic problems, and asthma. When ethnicity and income are considered, the picture is even more troubling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>African-American and Hispanic families have the greatest risk for overweight and obesity, and youngsters from lower-income families have a higher risk for obesity than those from higher-income families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 40 percent of African-American teenagers are overweight, and nearly 25 percent are obese.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hispanic children have the highest lifetime risk of diabetes (52 percent for boys, 45 percent for girls), followed closely by African-American children (49 percent for boys, 40 percent for girls).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the mid-seventies, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased sharply for both adults and children. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, among  adults aged 20-74 years the prevalence of obesity increased from 15.0 percent (in the 1976-1980 survey) to 32.9 percent (in the 2003-2004 survey). There were also increases in overweight among children and teens. For children aged 2-5 years, the prevalence of overweight increased from 5.0 percent to 13.9 percent; for those aged 6-11 years, prevalence increased from 6.5 percent to 18.8 percent; and for those aged 12-19 years, prevalence increased from 5.0 percent to 17.4 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These increasing rates raise concern because of their implications for Americans' health. Being overweight or obese increases the risk of many diseases and health conditions, including the following: hypertension; dyslipidemia (for example, high total cholesterol or high levels of triglycerides); type 2 diabetes; coronary heart disease; stroke; gallbladder disease; osteoarthritis; sleep apnea and respiratory problems; and some cancers: (endometrial, breast, and colon).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must stop the obesity trends now. We cannot afford the health cost or financial cost that are resulting and will continue to result from the alarming obesity rates in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AMENDMENT TO <bill type="h" number="2844">H.R. 2844</bill></paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also offered a nutrition-related amendment to <bill type="h" number="2844">H.R. 2844</bill>, "The Food Security and Agricultural Development Act of 2007." That amendment contains two simple, but very important, provisions. It states that it is U.S. policy to use non-emergency food aid to work to ensure that all members of a community, and particularly children, receive proper nutrition. It also recognizes the importance of non-emergency aid in mitigating the catastrophic effects of potential future emergencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Malnutrition remains a significant problem worldwide, particularly among children. According to the United Nations World Food Programme, severe acute malnutrition affects an estimated 20 million children under 5 worldwide. It kills approximately 1 million children each year, or an average of one every 30 seconds. According to UNICEF Director Ann M. Veneman, malnutrition plays some part in 53 percent of all deaths of children under 5. When an emergency situation does arise, malnutrition increases  dramatically and kills most quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These statistics are absolutely staggering. They are unnecessary. The World Food Programme estimates that, when implemented on a large scale and combined with hospital treatment for children who suffer complications, a community-based approach to combating malnutrition could save the lives of hundreds of thousands of children each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment recognizes the need to meet a community's nutritional needs, particularly those of the children. It highlights the need for non-emergency assistance to address these devastating, long-term deficiencies. There are strong links between a lack of development and the effects of humanitarian emergencies, and the second part of my amendment highlights these. This legislation takes the very important step of setting aside $600,000,000 specifically for non-emergency programs, recognizing  the need to finance development. We must act to ensure that the world's most vulnerable populations have access to the long-term solutions that will permit them to fight off hunger, not just in the immediate aftermath of a catastrophe, but in the years and decades to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2007 Farm Bill makes conservation a cornerstone of agriculture for all producers in all regions of the country. The bill increases funding and access to conservation programs to preserve farm and ranchland, improve water quality and quantity, and enhance soil conservation, air quality, and wildlife habitat on working lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2007 Farm Bill also includes key provisions that invest in rural communities nationwide, including economic development programs that target rural areas in need and broadband telecommunication services to bridge the digital divide and provide access to rural, underserved areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2007 Farm Bill boosts funding for renewable energy programs by 600 percent. It encourages the production of renewable energy, including biofuels and biobased products that protects our environment and encourages energy independence. It also provides loan guarantees for the development of biorefineries that process biofuels from dedicated energy crops and agriculture and forestry waste materials, a key step toward bringing more renewable fuels to market in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the reauthorization of the Farm Bill presents an opportunity for our Nation to have a food system that is more just and sustainable. Current policy in the United States has not adequately met the needs of people living in poverty, small and mid-sized farmers, or of rural America; nor has it been effective in protecting the environment in which we must live. We can do better. Now is the time for us to make a real difference in the lives of people across our nation and around the  world. We can do just that with passage of <bill type="h" number="2419">H.R. 2419</bill>. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me once again thank the chairman of the committee and the ranking member for the bipartisan work that they have put into allowing this great bill to reach the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I think this amendment is going to be a real win for America and a win for American farmers and a win for democracy. What it allows is that the people in Cuba can purchase hundreds of millions of dollars of goods from our farmers and be able to pay directly to U.S. banks without going through the red tape with the restrictions that we have on their visas and having to go to third countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Close to 50 years ago, someone came up with the great idea that in order to get rid of Castro and the communist government, that we should put an embargo on that country, which, of course, included food products that our great farmers are producing. Well, what has happened is that Castro is still there and we have gone through 10 presidents, and we are the only country that it appears as though has this embargo, which is truly ineffective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having said that, it would just seem to me that if we really want to win the hearts and minds of the people in Cuba, that we should make it abundantly clear that our greatest salesmen are our farmers, to be able to give food and nutrition to these people, and the money comes here and the food goes there. Hugo Chavez may be there trying to give them oil, but the poor people in Cuba can't eat oil. So this would open up the markets by hundreds of millions of dollars for wheat, pork, chicken, rice  and beans, instead of having the Cubans go to Thailand and Europe, and indeed to go to Communist China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I know there is a lot of fear about communists, but if you take a look at our deficit with the People's Republic of China, if you see our exploding exchange with the communist government of Vietnam, give me a break. This has nothing to do with communism, very little to do with Cuba, and a heck of a lot to do as to how people are going to vote in Miami and in Florida as relates to Republicans and Democrats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have a great opportunity to do what America does best: compete on the open market of competition. Let's try to take local and domestic politics out of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know it is difficult, because those who oppose this, they don't like Castro. Well, I am 77 years old. Forty years of that has been fighting Castro with an embargo. Young people, that is not going to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>If you want to get rid of Castro, let American enterprise, capitalism, farmers, food, liberty, justice, get that into Cuba, and that will bring the old man down.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am strongly opposed to this amendment that rewards a state sponsor of terrorism with unfettered access to our banks and increases the threat to our country. It condones terrorist financing through our banking system. We do not allow other state sponsors of terrorism, such as Iran, Syria, Sudan, and North Korea, to have direct access to U.S. banks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During a visit with Iran's Ayatollah in May 2001, Castro declared that together Cuba and Iran will bring America to its knees. We should not allow the Cuban regime to access U.S. bank accounts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then there is the troubling provision to expedite visas for so-called Cuban agricultural inspectors. This would give free rein to any intelligence agent that the Cuban Government designates as an agricultural investigator to come to the United States. We should not open our borders to any Cuban agent to roam freely throughout the United States under the guise of being agricultural inspectors.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400316" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his outstanding leadership on this issue now and in the past. This is something that I support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent report by the U.S. International Trade Commission shows the United States was a main supplier of ag products to Cuba last year, accounting for 30 percent of the island's imports. This report indicates that number could increase to 50 percent if the United States would only end some of its decades-long restrictions on trade between the two nations. This report shows that lifting the trade and travel restrictions against Cuba can have a real effect on the U.S. farm economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, since 2000, American farmers and other ag exporters have been allowed to sell goods to Cuba only on a cash-only basis. So with elimination of all such travel and trade restrictions, U.S. exports to Cuba could almost double from the 2006 level. The largest gains would be fresh fruits, vegetables, milk powder, processed foods, and certain meats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is long overdue and would take care of those factors and finally allow our ag producers to benefit from Cuban trade.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 1/2  minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee of the Legislative Branch.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SCHULTZ, WASSERMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate Chairman Peterson for an excellent farm bill which I support and look forward to supporting, assuming this amendment is not added to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do have the utmost respect for the gentleman from New York and have enjoyed my time serving with him in the House of Representatives, but I rise in opposition to his amendment which provides the Cuban regime with the ability to open bank accounts in the United States and obtain visas for regime officials to visit U.S. production facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support the farm bill, but this amendment needlessly adds a volatile political issue to this important bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cuba is one of five countries in the world that is a state sponsor of terror, along with North Korea, Iran, Syria and Sudan. This amendment would allow access to our financial institutions by a regime that is and maintains close relationships with other state sponsors of terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, we have been especially vigilant about not allowing access to our financial institutions since 9/11. We adopted the Bank Secrecy Act. We have made sure there are countless accountability measures to ensure that financial institutions have the ability  to protect themselves from people who would do us harm, and this amendment would go in the opposite direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, regular Cuban citizens are prohibited from engaging in private economic activity; thus, general agricultural licenses will only serve the purpose of allowing agents of the Cuban Government into the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I want to remind Members that while the Castro regime seeks U.S. concessions to finance its existence, it has consistently rejected offers of direct U.S. humanitarian assistance to the Cuban people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to vote against this amendment. The Cuban people stand at the cusp of actualizing their dreams of freedom. It is our duty to stand by them during this historic time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it is my understanding that the United States does a lot of trading back and forth with Pakistan. Today we understand, in fact, that Osama bin Laden may be hiding in the hills in Pakistan, so let's get this record straight here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is about only having Cuba to pay cash in advance, cash in advance for any products that are shipped. It also says that the U.S. Government has created unreasonable obstacles to American businesspeople in their trade with Cuba, which can average $2 billion in agricultural products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me give you an example. Today Cuba has increased its purchases of rice from Vietnam because of the payment restrictions imposed by the United States. That is $200 million that could be directed towards our farmers and not to Vietnam. Talk to the folks from Arkansas. Talk to the folks from Louisiana. Wouldn't it be better if our rice farmers, in fact, could be the beneficiaries of that market?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us end this foolishness of making a restriction on our farmers to sell their agricultural products to Cuba. Cuba is the only country in the world on which we put these kinds of restrictions.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412186" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise briefly to respectfully state my strong opposition to this amendment because I believe that we must not open our financial institutions to a state sponsor of terrorism like the Cuban regime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Rangel amendment has almost nothing to do with agricultural interests. In fact, it may actually cause harm to our agricultural community. What this amendment does do is threaten our national security. This amendment allows the Cuban Regime, a state sponsor of terrorism, access to U.S. financial institutions and allows its agents access to U.S. visas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If adopted, the Rangel amendment will legitimize the Cuban Regime and provide them with the opportunity to continue its sponsorship of terrorism. It will also provide high level regime officials access to U.S. visas to travel throughout the United States. At a time when our country has declared a war on terror and we have worked to cut the flow of money to terrorists and terrorists access to our financial institutions, we must not open our financial institutions to help finance state sponsors  of terrorism. By adopting this amendment, we will be doing just that, rewarding the Cuban Regime and supporting the financing of a state sponsor of terrorism.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400260" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it was interesting that the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee pointed out since the time Dictator Castro has held sway over the Cuban people, the United States has had Presidents come and go, which seems to point to one ineluctable fact: the United States, as a free people, can make their Presidents come and go, which is an option the Cuban people do not have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a practical matter, I oppose this amendment for a very simple reason: it would open up trade with a state sponsor of terrorism, and I can find no logical way to differentiate one state sponsor of terrorism from another. It would be akin to simply trying to determine what the make of the car that ran you over was as opposed to the driver. In either event, you are probably likely dead, and the rest of the question is academic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, we have heard much in this debate about the benefit that we may reap in terms of our corporations and farmers, but let us never forget that the United States must always care more about the cause of human freedom than about mere money.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the agricultural issue in this amendment is really a subterfuge, because if we read, for example, the spokesman of U.S. Agribusiness, Mr. Radlow, he states that in the 5 years that we have been selling products to Cuba, the political hurdles have never hurt. We know how to deal with third-party banks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People use the hurdles as an excuse for not getting a contract. It is legal to sell agricultural products to the Castro regime since the year 2000. But as the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz) pointed out, ever since 2001 and the attacks of 2001, we have been making sure that U.S. financial institutions, to the greatest extent we can achieve it, are protected from state sponsors of terrorism. And as a matter of fact, the regulation being discussed today was requested by  U.S. financial institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let's not get confused. This amendment would allow a state sponsor of terrorism on the list of state sponsors of terrorism U.S. bank accounts and visas for their agents, over a dozen of which have been convicted in recent years alone of spying against United States interests. So let's vote down resoundingly this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="LEE" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Rangel amendment and thank the gentleman for offering such a forward thinking measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment will remove the banking restrictions that require prepayment for agricultural goods, that keep Cuban families from purchasing food from American family farmers. And frankly it's past time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is past time to leave out-dated cold war era thinking on U.S.-Cuban relations out where they belong--in the cold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is past time to reach out to the Cuban people and allow them to engage our democratic free markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is past time to restore the rights of the American family farmer's access to upwards of $300 million dollars in sales to the Cuban market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It makes no sense to me to allow agricultural exports into Cuba on one hand an then turn around and set up bureaucratic banking restrictions that severely limit those very exports on the other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Chairman RANGEL for his leadership on this issue and I hope to work with him to bring some common sense to Cuba policy.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me first congratulate Mr. Peterson and Mr. Goodlatte and the bipartisan group of members on the Ag Committee who have brought this bill to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the several tax increases contained in the bill I think are problematic, and we will deal with that later in this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the amendment that I bring to the floor today aims to fix a problem that has been identified by the administration and others but has not been addressed in the bill that we have before us. This bill would extend a policy that permits farmers to receive loan deficiency payments based on a daily posted county price, and I think that would allow a mistake to continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are going to continue loan deficiency payments, I think we need to address the situation that allows farmers to lock in an LDP when prices are low and then to sell that crop when prices are high. LDPs are a valuable tool for farmers, and in order to preserve this valuable tool, we need to fix this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Loan deficiency payments enable farmers to receive financing early in the harvest season, preventing farmers from forfeiting their crops to the government and allow commodities to be marketed in response to market demand. As I said, they are a valuable tool, and if we do not preserve their integrity, I think they are likely to blow up and to be eliminated entirely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would replace the daily posted county price with a monthly posted county price. The monthly PCP would be the average of five daily PCPs on preset days during the previous month, taking out the high price and the low price for that month. Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns included this provision in his farm bill recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problems with calculating LDPs based on the daily posted county price were highlighted in the days after Hurricane Katrina. Because of the hurricane, transport of grain on the Mississippi River was stopped for several days. This caused a short-term precipitous drop in market prices which then triggered a number of farmers to go in and trigger their LDP payments. The farmers who locked in these artificially low LDPs were simply using the program to increase payments that they received from  the government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was not the purpose of the marketing loan program or the LDP program. Marketing loans and LDPs are intended to allow farmers to receive financing early in the harvest season to allow commodities to be marketed in response to demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>If we want to increase subsidies for farmers, let's be honest about it. If we allow the marketing loan program and LDPs to continue to be used in this manner, we'll be undermining their integrity by allowing them to game a pricing system that reacts to daily natural disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think supporting a good farm policy is important, but exploiting catastrophic natural disasters cannot stand. So I believe we need to make this change if we're going to preserve LDPs and the integrity of our good farm policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400316" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, Mr. Boehner is a good friend of mine, and I am reluctant to oppose this amendment but I must.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision was part of the administration's farm bill proposal. The benefit of daily posted county prices is that farmers have the greatest amount of flexibility in responding to market price changes, which have become, as indicated by Mr. Boehner, increasingly volatile, and the farmers have very little power in this marketplace. This is something that I think we clearly should retain for them so that they've got some ability to deal with what happens in the marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moving to a monthly posted county price may save money, but as I said, it hampers, weakens the effectiveness of the marketing loan program as a safety net feature, which is one of the primary things we're trying to do in this farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a letter from the National Grain and Feed Association, this proposal would be highly disruptive to the efficient operation of the cash grain marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The entire General Farm Commodities and Risk Management Subcommittee, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected this approach when it defeated an amendment containing the administration's proposal that had this feature in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment, this idea has no support in the agricultural community; and, therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, and I appreciate his leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an example of a simple, commonsense reform that needs to be in a farm bill. Just because it was buried in the overall administrative proposal and rejected does not mean that it doesn't have merit. It's not that this just saves money; it avoids an unnecessary complication and room to game the system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What Mr. Boehner said is true, there are billions of dollars at play here. Obviously this may not be supported in the farm country to fix the loophole because this is an opportunity for them to make unjustified money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge support with this simple, commonsense reform.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman from Oregon said, this is simply a commonsense amendment. In the days after Katrina, people were able to lock in artificially low prices and make billions, billions of dollars at the expense of the taxpayer when they then sold at the higher price. So it was simply a way to game the system. That's all it was. There's no other explanation for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And to say that the agricultural community rejects it doesn't say anything about its worthiness as a commonsense reform measure. This needs to be done. It's common sense. There's no justifiable explanation to allow people to game the system.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of our time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the days after Katrina, and just several days after Katrina, when we had the precipitous drop in prices, it cost the Federal Government $3.5 billion in extra LDP payments. So what we're talking about here is sound agricultural policy and sound policy with regard to America's taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think about the fairness of the farmer who sold his crop the day before Katrina. Think about what he felt like when several days later his fellow farmers ended up with hundreds of thousands of dollars more in extra benefits from the government because they just happened to sell a day or two before Hurricane Katrina hit.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400316" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I think what people need to  understand, the farmer that sold the day before Katrina got his money out of the marketplace, and what the LDP did is protect those farmers that sold later to get the same price that farmer got right before Katrina. So that's exactly what this is supposed to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Farmers don't have any power in this marketplace to speak of. If you want to give all the power to the big guys, go to this system. It's not what we want to do in the Ag Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, I served for the last 17 years with Mr. Peterson on the Ag Committee. I'm on leave, and I know all my colleagues on the Ag Committee are glad that I'm on leave. But the fact is that marketing loans and loan deficiency payments were there to facilitate the marketing of a crop. They weren't there to make or set up a system to allow or to put farmers in a position where they become day traders, and the current system does, in fact, allow that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So instead of looking at a daily posted county price, if you looked at a monthly posted county price where you take out the high for the month and the low for the month and pick 5 days, you've got a fair price for all farmers. You've got a fair system that prevents people from gaming the system because of some abnormality in the market that may occur on one or two days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a commonsense amendment. I would urge my colleagues to adopt it.</paragraph>
