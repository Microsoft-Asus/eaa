  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, President Kennedy, 47 years ago at the establishment of the Peace Corps, said that reactions to the Peace Corps are proof that we have in America "an immense reservoir of such men and women, anxious to sacrifice their energies and time and toil to the cause of world peace and human progress."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What was true in 1961 as it is true today. Peace Corps volunteers are an outstanding group of men and women serving the cause of humanity across the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, those words have even more meaning for me as my daughter Anne is serving in the Peace Corps in Mozambique.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this National Peace Corps Week, I want to commend the service and commitment of the Peace Corps volunteers from my community and express our pride in fellow Oregonians who have chosen to devote 2 years or more of their lives in service to others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to Anne Blumenauer, I would like to recognize John Bento, serving in Georgia; Amanda Bickle-Eldridge, serving in Nicaragua; Stuart Chidester, serving in Paraguay; Melanie Edwards, serving in Azerbaijan; Ashley Hollenbeck, serving in Morocco; Andrea Lawrence, serving in Bolivia; James Lensen-Callas, serving in Peru; Erik Nelson, serving in Georgia; Sami Oeser, serving in Botswana; Sandra Stevens, serving in Jamaica; Paul Sylvester, serving in Samoa; Normand Tremblay, serving in Cameroon;  and Natalie Wilson, serving in Botswana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are the foundation for creating a safer and more prosperous world, establishing a better future for people everywhere.</paragraph>
