  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, regarding the recently revealed abuses of power and process by the FBI, Director Mueller has now indicated that he should have provided adequate training, experience and oversight. He is right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it also ignores what may have been one of the underlying contributors to the ultimate problem now revealed. Director Mueller has for some time now changed personnel policies at the FBI that he knew would drive out some of his best agents with the most and best experience to handle such very sensitive PATRIOT Act powers. When a director decides that his policies are far wiser than others, even as he sees that he is driving many of his best, most experienced agents and employees out of their  supervisory roles, he has an even greater burden to see that his agents are trained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some tried to advise him of the damage to the ranks of experience that he was causing by what he thought to be innovative personnel management. He did not listen, and he did not ensure that the turnover he was creating left adequately trained personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a wonderful thing when a leader goes against all the critics to do what he knows to be right, and he is, in fact, right. However, when a leader goes against critics who tried to tell him he was wrong, and he is later proved to be quite wrong, he should do the noble thing and step down without further ado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Director Mueller has stated himself he must take the responsibility, and he is right. He must and he should. He should step down.</paragraph>
