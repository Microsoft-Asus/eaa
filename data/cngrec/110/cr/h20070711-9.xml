    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this Saturday the President will issue an interim report on the Iraqi government's success or failure meeting the benchmarks. But prior to taking a look at that report, we have another set of benchmarks to look at; that is, the benchmarks for President Bush's administration and what they've done on the Iraqi policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the war began, The White House said that Americans would be greeted as liberators. That's not happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next we were told oil revenues would finance the reconstruction of the Iraqi society. Not happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we were told that the insurgency was in its last throes. Not happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we were told that we were planting a democracy in the heart of the Mideast. Not happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At every turn, the administration's benchmarks for the Iraqi strategy have failed to meet their own measure of success. And the American people have been asked to pay for this failure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two years ago, we were spending $5 billion a month in Iraq. It is now reported that we're up to $10 billion a month in resources, not counting the amount of lives we lose on a monthly basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we've waited long enough. The President's strategy of more troops, more time, more money and more of the same has run its course. It's time for a new direction.</paragraph>
