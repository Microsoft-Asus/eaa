    <paragraph>Madam President, today I congratulate Penobscot Bay Porch Swings of Brunswick, a woman-owned company dedicated to reviving the tradition of porch swings in my home State of Maine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Inspired by the old-fashioned hammock swings she saw along the Maine coast while on a field trip with her daughter, Sarah Bloy began creating the prototype for what would become the widely popular Penobscot Bay Porch Swing. After 4 years of planning and a trip to the Marine Canvas Training Institute, Ms. Bloy commenced production of her porch swings in January 2005. Each swing, which takes between 8 and 10 hours to make, is delicately produced in a studio workshop at Brunswick's Fort Andross  by Ms. Bloy with the assistance of her dedicated employee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Penobscot Bay Porch Swings is a successful small business due to Ms. Bloy's entrepreneurial and innovative spirit. Her company's hand-made porch swings are similar to those fashionable at the turn of the 20th century in Maine and New England, illiciting nostalgia for some and amazement for many others. Penobscot Bay Porch Swings offers an assortment of styles that were named to celebrate Maine's coastal heritage. The Bar Harbor, Kennebunkport, and Camden are some of the swing styles available.  Moreover, the swings' vibrant colors provide a contemporary look to a time-tested design. Choosing between colors, such as Capri blue and Tuscan orange, Jockey red and Seville Seaside stripes, customers have many bright and welcoming options for the color of their swing. And each hammock swing is carefully crafted with mildew resistant Sunbrella fabric to temper the tough elements of New England's climate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Bloy has also created the inventive Castine Cradle, a swing-like crib especially designed for babies and infants. Along with the swings and cradles, Ms. Bloy also constructs a plethora of brilliant pillows to coordinate with her swings, in even more creative colors like Beachfront Balsam and Sandrine Sunset. Her sights are set on expanding her business, with the hopes of designing new and more creative products for her clientele to enjoy for seasons to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Porch swings and hammocks have long been a staple of east coast life, and Ms. Bloy's expertly crafted swings will help to revitalize interest in this outstanding tradition. Penobscot Bay Porch exemplifies what a small business can accomplish with a pioneering and talented Mainer, such as Sarah Bloy, at the helm. Penobscot Bay Porch Swings has built a reputation of meticulous craftsmanship and durability, and I wish Sarah and everyone at Penobscot Bay Porch Swings the best of luck as they continue  to thrive and expand.</paragraph>
