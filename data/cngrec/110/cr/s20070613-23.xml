    <paragraph>Madam President, today there is a great deal of debate about how Americans are doing, in particular those considered low income. I rise today to dispel a major misconception about the progress of low-income Americans. Those on the other side of the aisle would have you believe that when one person does better it must be at the expense of another. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, when Congress adopts policies that encourages individuals to work harder, save, take risks,  and invest more, the economy does better and everyone benefits. Two recent studies I requested from CBO prove a rising tide does lift all boats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first report issued in December, entitled "Changes in Low Wage Labor Markets Between 1979 and 2005," found that the inflation adjusted hourly earnings of U.S. workers was 10 percent higher now than back in 1979. Since 1990 those in the bottom 10th percentile of wage earners witnessed their inflation adjusted wages increase 12.8 percent, more than 2.5 percentage points faster than those in the statistical middle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CBO's second report entitled "Changes in the Economic Resources of Low-Income Households with Children" indicates that poor households with children experienced real earnings gains of 80 percent since 1991, outpacing even those in the top income quintile whose earnings grew 54 percent. This fact is even more amazing viewed in the context of welfare reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those opposing welfare reforms in the mid 1990s argued that limiting direct Government assistance and requiring low-income people to work more would prove to be disastrous. However, low-income households with children now rely less on the Government, are more self reliant and have a higher standard of living. In 1991, low-income households relied on the Government for a majority of their income with earnings accounting for just 49 percent. Today, low-income households earn 65 percent of their  income and rely on Government assistance for the remainder. Female headed households also rely less on the Government for their livelihood. In 1991, 35 percent of their income was earned compared with 54 percent now. The share of their income derived from AFDC or TANF fell from 42 percent in 1991 to 7 percent in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These two studies prove that when the Government interferes less in the lives of its citizens, they are more productive. Once unencumbered by Government, people are motivated to work harder, save, and invest more.</paragraph>
