  <narrative>FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT -- (Senate - November 13, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14350">S14350</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have been working very diligently on both sides of the aisle today to put together a list of amendments we could agree with each other would be the maximum number and substance of amendments that would be offered on the farm bill. Senator Reid, Senator McConnell, Senator Harkin, Senator Conrad, and myself have all been engaged in different conversations today about these amendments. At the end of the day, the lists we have come  up with are very long on both sides. I think the total number exceeds 275.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, on bills of this magnitude, an overwhelming number of those amendments will ultimately disappear. We will dispose of them by either bringing them to the floor by accepting them or by the authors and proponents of those amendments agreeing at the end of the day that they simply don't want to do anything other than talk about their amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are not able to enter into a unanimous consent agreement on this right now. I understand the leadership is going to wait until in the morning to do that. But by starting first thing in the morning, I think we do have the opportunity to move through a significant number of these amendments, and I encourage the proponents of the amendments on both sides of the aisle to think seriously about whether you want to see a farm bill completed, and if you do, then come down, agree to a minimal amount  of time we can use for debate and discussion on the amendments, and let's move through these amendments with as much haste as we possibly can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do regret that--we are here ready to agree to a unanimous consent that this will be the complete list and we will begin working and we look forward to being here tomorrow in that same frame of mind, to agree to the list of amendments as proposed on both sides of the aisle. We are not happy with some of their amendments and I understand they are not happy with some of the amendments coming from this side. Again, that is the way this body has always worked, and I hope in the morning we are ready  to proceed and we can move toward debate, discussion, and voting on these various amendments, and that we can conclude this as soon as possible, whether that is before we leave this week--it may be impossible--but in any event, we will begin work on it tomorrow.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, while my friend is on the floor and my friend from South Dakota is on the floor, through the Chair to my friend from Georgia, looking at these two lists kind of puts a smile on your face, because it is quite a list. There is a multitude of tax issues and a lot of things totally not relevant to this farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I would say through the Chair to my friend that I am going to take a look at this--I have had some good meetings with my staff and Senator Harkin today--and make a decision about what we should do on this tomorrow. But the question I have of my friend from Georgia is how long do we have to work on this, work our way through these amendments? There are about 280 or 290 amendments. I sit here today and I say again, I have no doubt that the vast majority of the Democrats--with a significant  majority of Democrats, with a handful of help from the Republicans, cloture would be invoked on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I say to my friend, how long do you think we should play around with all of these amendments? Is there a magic number we need to have votes on some of them? When should I file cloture? If farm State Senators and if other Senators want a farm bill, time is wasting. We have a few more days left in this work period before Thanksgiving, and when we come back after Thanksgiving we have a very short 3 weeks to get all of the Federal Government's work done that has to be done before the calendar  year ends. So I don't expect my friend to answer the question without talking to my counterpart on the other side, but I want him to think about how much longer do we do this little gesture we are going through here? We have wasted a lot of time. The question the Republicans have to make a decision on is do they want a farm bill? We want one. We want a farm bill. We will</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will have some meetings in the morning and we will report back to the ranking member of this very important committee.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to the majority leader I appreciate his comments. Obviously, I don't have the answer to the question as to how long we should consider the amendments before we file cloture. That is a decision for the majority leader to make on his own, hopefully in  consultation with the leadership on this side. But what I would say is we started this process last week. There were procedural issues that had to be resolved last week. We sat around for a couple of days without being able to bring up amendments. Here we are again. We have sat around today, again, without having the opportunity to bring them up. After having served 8 years in the House, I have an appreciation of the Senate as I have never had before. It is a deliberative body that our forefathers  decided it should be, and I have seen no better example of that deliberation than I have on this particular bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That being said, we won't know when it is the right time to file cloture until we begin the work, and if we begin the work on this tomorrow, I know from our side of the aisle--and I will make the commitment--we will move these amendments as quickly as possible. There is the great likelihood that a number of these amendments won't be called up, but we won't know until we get into the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My farmers and ranchers want a farm bill. They like the one we have, but this bill, in my opinion, improves ag policy for the next 5 years. If we should not be able to get a farm bill, then an extension of the current farm bill is one of the options that is out there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have said all along that I think we could improve that product and this farm bill does that. So I hope we can come here in the morning with the idea that we are going to take up these amendments and we will take the Grassley and Dorgan amendment as the first one. That is on payment limits. I am opposed to the amendment and I will have a lot to say about it during the debate, but we are ready to talk about it and we are ready to begin the process. I hope that with all of the counsel available  to the majority leader, he will be prepared with us to begin the debate and vote on these amendments in the morning.</paragraph>
