  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO TECHNICAL SERGEANT ANTHONY CAPRA -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2738]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I quote: "Somehow or other their faces seemed different from those of ordinary men."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Winston Churchill wrote those words about volunteers who risked their lives defusing bombs in wartime. I imagine that he saw in their faces the constant strain of knowing that their smallest movements over the bomb could mean the difference between life and death. I imagine that he saw in the lines and creases the evidence of the burden they carried for their comrades; and, deeper still, some indefinable quality that made them willing to take that burden on again and again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I never met Technical Sergeant Tony Capra. But underneath all the marks of strain and stress, I am sure I could have seen there his love for his family: His wife, Angie; his five children, Mark, Victoria, Jared, Shawn, and Adrianna; his 11 brothers and sisters; his mother and his father.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week I had the opportunity to talk to his father about the loss of his son in Iraq as he disabled an IED and it exploded. Obviously, he saved scores of others, and paid the ultimate price. His dad, as one would imagine, was extraordinarily sad, but also exceptionally proud of the duty his son had performed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure I could have seen in his devotion to our Armed Forces an absolute commitment to their mission, to his duty, to his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Tony Capra, 31 years of age, died on April 9th in Iraq. He was an Air Force Ordnance Technician based in Indian Head City, Maryland, in my district, an expert diffuser of improvised explosive devices. Quoting from the report about him, his "keen eye for details, astounding memory, and courage without measure," in the words of his commanding officer, as I have said, saved countless lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in the middle of an Iraqi road, not far from Balad Air Force Base, an explosion took his life. Sergeant Capra was on his fourth tour in Iraq. When he could have rested at home, he volunteered to return to work, to work  against explosive devices designed to maim and kill his fellow soldiers, as well as innocent Iraqi men and women, and, yes, too many children. He placed his body in harm's way. He laid his life down for others. He died in our country's  service and was posthumously awarded a second Bronze Star.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this great Nation owes him a debt far beyond its power to repay. It is because of the bravery and sacrifice of American patriots like Tony Capra that a dangerous dictator no longer menaces his own people and the world, and that 25 million human beings who were oppressed for a quarter of a century are currently struggling to establish a democratic government that answers to its own people, that stands for freedom, and respects the rule of law. That was Tony Capra's vision. That is why he served  his country so well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope, in time, that Tony's unwavering patriotism and courage gives some comfort to his family. I know it does. But, today, there is so little we can say to soften this blow. As his young brother James said shortly after his death, "It's like a puzzle. Our family is not complete without all the pieces together."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Memories of Tony are all that can be put in his place, and I know how insufficient they must seem right now. But my sincere hope for you, the family and friends of Sergeant Capra, is that those memories will turn in time from a source of grief to a well of comfort; that you will be consoled by the loving and devoted way he lived, and the fearless way he died in the service of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me end with this thought. We often speak in abstractions in this Chamber. We use words like "supplemental," "counterinsurgency," "redeployment." But behind each of these words is a young life like Sergeant Capra's. More than 4,000 Americans, like Tony Capra, have paid the ultimate price, have given the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation in Iraq and Afghanistan. They bear the burden of the decisions we make here almost every day. And we have a responsibility, indeed, we have a moral  obligation, to never forget the Tony Capras and the 4,000 others whom we have lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, may God bless Tony Capra, a man of courage, patriotism, valor and commitment, and may He console and strengthen those who grieve his loss.</paragraph>
