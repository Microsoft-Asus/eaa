    <paragraph>Mr President, today I honor an exceptional small business from my home State of Maine that is striving to employ more Mainers and revive tourism in one of Maine's hidden natural treasures. The New England Outdoors Center of Millinocket is a multifaceted ecotourism and recreational sports business and a wonderful example of entrepreneurial spirit in Maine. Local residents of the Millinocket region and tourists, who come from far and wide to see Maine's splendor and beauty, enjoy the  Outdoors Center's diversity of services. In addition, the Center's owner, Matt Polstein, is working to add a resort to his business which would bring additional jobs to the Katahdin region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The New England Outdoors Center is an all-season facility that consists of a snowmobile business, the River Drivers restaurant, and a white water rafting enterprise. The Outdoors Center provides a gateway to Baxter State Park and the spectacular Mount Katahdin, the Appalachian Trail's northern terminus. The Center has won numerous commendations throughout its decades of operation, including a Maine Tourism award. It is a member of the Katahdin Area Chamber of Commerce, the Maine Tourism Association,  the Maine Snowmobile Association, and many other groups. Matt Polstein and the New England Outdoors Center's endeavors greatly benefit the local economy, which has recently been suffering due to a slump in visitors to Baxter State Park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In light of this decline in tourism, Matt Polstein's vision of building the new Ktaadn Resorts on Hammond Ridge is particularly critical in bringing people back to the Katahdin region and to all of Maine. Mr. Polstein's $65 million proposal evidences his commitment and determination to create new jobs for Mainers and to contribute to the growth of Millinocket's regional economy. The plan has garnered the support of the Millinocket community and its leaders, as well as the unanimous endorsement  of Maine's Land Use Regulation Commission, which oversees the state's planning and zoning for plantations, townships, and unorganized areas without local governance. This forward-thinking proposal for a new resort is one of the largest resort proposals in Maine's Unorganized Territory history--a true victory for all involved. Conscious of the environment, Mr. Polstein is</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is vital that we respect our natural surroundings, and Matt Polstein's proposal does just that. It is a bright example of the kind of intelligent planning that benefits Maine's economy while protecting the State's natural environment. Mount Katahdin is a shining example of what makes Maine beautiful, and Mr. Polstein's dedication to the improvement of his community exemplifies what makes Maine people so special. I commend Matt Polstein for his public service as a city councillor in Millinocket,  his current business ventures that provide accommodations and services to tourists year-round, and for his smart and bright entrepreneurial savvy with the future Ktaadn Resorts. I wish Mr. Polstein and everyone at the New England Outdoors Center continued prosperity, and a successful completion to the Ktaadn Resorts.</paragraph>
