  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO DON MEYER -- (Senate - February 12, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="918">S918</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor Don Meyer, the head men's basketball coach at Northern State University, NSU, in Aberdeen, SD. Coach Meyer recently won his 880th coaching career victory and currently has the most wins of any active coach in men's basketball. This accomplishment places Coach Meyer in second place on the collegiate all-time win list, trailing only Bobby Knight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coach Meyer began coaching at NSU in 1999 and has led the Wolves to 178 victories. Prior to coming to Aberdeen, he coached for 24 seasons at David Lipscomb University in Nashville, TN, and three seasons at Hamline University in Minneapolis, MN.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite his many accomplishments, Don Meyer has remained extremely humble. He is always quick to praise his assistant coaches, players, and fans for the invaluable role they play in his accomplishments. This humility has earned him the respect and admiration of his players. His excellent example of leadership and teamwork has even inspired one of his former players to write a book chronicling his time playing for Coach Meyer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coach Meyer is truly an example of the dedication and inspiration that is found in South Dakota's coaches. He has given the young people of South Dakota a fine example of what it means to be leader both on and off the court. On behalf of the State of South Dakota, I am proud to commend Coach Meyer on this impressive accomplishment and wish him and the Wolves all the best for their continued success.</paragraph>
