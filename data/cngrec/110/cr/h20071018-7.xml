    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 150th anniversary of the town in which I grew up, Coggon, Iowa. Coggon's motto is, "The One and Only." Indeed, there is only one Coggon, but like so many small towns across our country, it is a place people are proud to call home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that the people of Coggon appreciate the genial nature and the proud history of the town. The name Coggon was agreed upon at a banquet held at the Clemons House in 1888. Superintendent T. Spaulding suggested it. He had received a letter from his cousin, William Coggon, and thought the name would be appropriate. At that time, Superintendent Spaulding was supervising the construction of the Illinois Central Railroad through the town. This railroad would later prove to be an economic engine  for Coggon, bringing in economic development and encouraging the growth of businesses. And on July 24, 1888, the settlement became Coggon, Iowa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, this small, wonderful town is populated by 745 people. Small towns have been the lifeblood of America. Even now, my own family and I live in Dimock, Pennsylvania, a town with a population of about 70. We take the time to get to know our neighbors, we are a community of values and we work hard to support our families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coggon, Iowa is the small town that lives in all of us. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Coggon's 150th anniversary.</paragraph>
