  <narrative>THE NOBLE THREE -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H3190]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, America's lawmen are the last strand of wire in the fence between the law and the outlaws. They are all that stands between chaos and civilization, between the barbarians and the people, and between what is good and what is evil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we honor these lawmen, I give special attention to the Capitol Police Officers. These officers are on duty 24 hours a day in the halls, on the roof, and in the shadows of this Capitol diligently protecting this shrine of democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ten years ago, a madman entered the Capitol, shot and killed Officer Jacob Chestnut. He headed to the majority leader's office and wounded Officer Douglas McMillan and tourist Angela Dickerson. His shooting stopped after he murdered John Gibson, who literally gave his life for a Member of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In these hallowed halls, we have portraits and statues of great Americans that have lived before us, but the spirit of duty, sacrifice, and honor is still alive and on display daily by those Capitol Police who serve us so well. They carry on the tradition of Chestnut, McMillan, and Gibson, those noble three that stood in the line of fire for the rest of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
