    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last week the Ways and Means Committee chairman outlined the provisions of what he has been calling the "mother of all tax bills."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The most important piece of information about this proposal is the bottom line. The proposal would mean a multi-trillion-dollar tax increase on the American taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this is a good moment to take a step back and look at the philosophical difference between Republicans and Democrats. On this side of the aisle, we simply believe people know how to spend their money better than the government. But just look at the legislation passed in the House so far this year: $431 billion in tax increases have been included in bills that have already passed the House this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we should remember, no one knows how to spend their money better than the taxpayer. We should be looking for ways to decrease the tax burden, not increase it.</paragraph>
