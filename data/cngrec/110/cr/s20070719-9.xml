  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think with the consent agreement we are prepared to yield back the time we still have. I want to join, first of all, in thanking my friend and colleague from Wyoming, as I did in the opening of the discussion and debate on education. This reauthorization legislation--the  one we will consider on Monday--is legislation that had Senator Enzi's name on it until the change in the makeup of the Senate. We had worked on  it in a bipartisan way. I think with the exception of the ethical issues, which have been developed more recently, it is by and large a reflection of a really strong bipartisan effort, as our reauthorization on the Head Start Program is as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the way we worked when Senator Enzi was the chairman. We have tried to follow that pathway. As he mentioned, there has been a long history of leaders in education who work on a bipartisan basis in the Senate, going back with the Republicans with Senator Stafford and with our friend Claiborne Pell, as well as Judd Gregg when he was chairman of the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we want to see this passed. Hopefully, by Tuesday sometime, we will be able to look back on these past days and see a job well done. But we still have work to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to take a moment of time, though, to join in thanking the staff. Senator Enzi has said it so well. There has been tireless work and a real willingness to find common ground. These staffs have worked very closely with all of us. These issues are of prime concern to every member of our committee. Every member of our committee is involved in these education issues. We have good exchanges on that, and they have all been interested for a long period of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I wish to thank, certainly, on my staff Michael Myers, who heads our committee staff and does such a wonderful job, Carmel Martin, and Missy Rohrbach. Missy even managed to get married during this period of time. I don't know how she found that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>J.D. LaRock, Erin Renner, Emma Vadehra, David Johns, Liz Maher, Parker Baxter and Nick Bath. For Senator Enzi, Katherine McGuire and Ilyse Schuman and Greg Dean, Beth Buehlmann and Ann Clough, Adam Briddell and Lindsey Hunsicker. There are many others, and I will include those as we go through the evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I was concluding the earlier remarks but I think many of our Members are ready to move ahead now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other major provisions of this legislation were the loan forgiveness for those in public service for 10 years, the ceiling on loan payments so they don't exceed 15 percent of monthly income, which assist people in repaying their loans in a responsible way. It is very solid legislation. It is good legislation. As I mentioned earlier, it deserves to be passed. We know the House is ready to move forward together on this bill. They have addressed this issue in the committee and they are ready  to move ahead. I think the country is ready for us to move ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have been willing and able to deal with education issues, I join in the plea of my friend and colleague from Wyoming in the hope we will not extend these amendments that have no relevance to the education of the young people in this country. They are entitled, I believe, to the kind of respect they should receive with an important piece of legislation that has been bipartisan, it has been worked through, and reflects the Nation's judgment in terms of understanding the importance young people  can play and must play in our country and in our democracy, in our economy and in our national security. This legislation deserves, I believe, to have a quick and speedy passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Yes, there is. So there will be points of order raised on amendments where those points of order should be raised.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400357" topic="">
    <paragraph>My question was similar to Senator Dorgan's. I was going to say that if there was a substantive debate, we are prepared to offer several second-degree amendments. I hope I don't have to do that because I agree with the Senator from Massachusetts that we are dealing with higher education now, a very important issue, and I think we should keep it clean and move forward. But if something else evolves, we are prepared to offer several second-degree amendments.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his very important contributions during the development of this legislation and his excellent statement on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am prepared to yield back the time, if my colleague is prepared to yield back. I think also for any amendments, can we request that we have the opportunity for 2 minutes of debate on any amendment that is going to be offered to be evenly divided. Furthermore, I ask unanimous consent that after the first vote, the time on each succeeding amendment be limited to 10 minutes.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the provision in this bill that creates an entirely new loan forgiveness program for Government public service workers I believe is unprincipled and can only get worse in the years to come. Actually, it has some pernicious aspects to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, it says if you are any Government worker or social service worker, it appears that as long as you are not in the private sector, after 10 years, the Government will forgive your loan debt. I think that is an odd thing for us to do, to have that many people have their loans forgiven.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think, No. 1, when people go to college and they make up their mind about how they are going to pay for college and whether they will work, this will be an inducement for people not to work and to borrow; it will encourage borrowing for loans. No. 2, it  does not have any limit on the amount of money involved, so those who go to more expensive colleges will obviously get more of the taxpayers' money than those who don't go to more expensive colleges  in terms of the loan forgiveness. I think that is not a healthy thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eighty percent of the colleges and universities in America don't use the Direct Loan Program. Eighty percent do not. You don't get this loan forgiveness unless you are part of the Direct Loan Program, or consolidate your loans with it. I think that is an odd bias in the system that I am not comfortable with. So I will say, again, I think this is creating a new bureaucracy, an unwise way to help workers. I would suggest if we want to help people, we should expand our Pell grants--as we have dramatically  and I support--and the loan programs in general but not to target a forgiveness program to people who have been working for the Government for 10 years who are probably better able to pay off the loan than they were the first 2 or 3 years they started to work. It doesn't make sense to me. I don't like this new program and all its ramifications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think our focus should be on Pell grants, on improving the loan program for everybody equally, and I don't think the plumber who is taking business courses so he might one day run his own business, or the nurse who is advancing her skill level so she might one day reach a higher level of pay, that one ought to be favored over the other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly believe our resources should be directed to overall strengthening of the loan program and not focusing on just Government employees. I am not putting down Government employees, but I will ask you about two Government employees, one who goes to a community college and works their way through and ends up with no debt and another one who incurs a good bit of debt, one gets benefits under this program, whereas the other one doesn't. I don't think that is a good principle. I think that  is hard to defend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How much time remains?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator has 17 remaining seconds.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair, and I thank Senator Kennedy. I know the bill does do some good things with regard to Pell grants and to focusing more of our loan money on some of the professions and areas of our economy that need more students involved, so I salute that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Massachusetts.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I understand we have 4 minutes. Earlier in the day, we had a good exchange with the Senator from Alabama. I pointed out that Alabama, under this legislation, gets an additional $442 million over the next 5 years in grant aid. My own State of Massachusetts gets $317 million. Alabama does exceedingly well, and that is under the need-based provisions of this program, the need-based provisions of this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from Alabama has raised I think three important points, and they should be addressed. First of all, the loan forgiveness is applicable to those who are on the Direct Loan Program or those who are on the Pell Grant Program. That is spelled out on page 14 of the legislation. That is spelled out on page 14.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, there is a cap--spelled out on page 30, that requires the borrower's annual adjusted gross income or annual earnings to be less than or equal to $65,000 for eligibility. So if they make more than $65,000, there is no loan forgiveness. So this is for those individuals who are working--the working middle class and the working poor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, we believe, as this chart points out, that there is a value in terms of public service employment. We have heard the announcement about the COMPETE Act and about those who are going to go to conference on the COMPETE Act. That bill addresses math and science education and many other important areas. Try to find a good math teacher to serve the public schools of Boston--it's extremely difficult--a good science teacher, a good chemistry teacher to work in a high-need school. Try to find  individuals who are going to work with the disabled population. Increasingly, we are finding challenges in meeting the needs of our elderly population so they can have independent living. We have listed the range of what we consider to be public service fields in this bill, and it is extensive. There is enormous need in America. There is an enormous desire of young people</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have mentioned many times, and in traveling around to schools and colleges in my State of Massachusetts, the number of young people who want to do public service and work and make a contribution to their community, to their local communities, to their State or to the country. We were reminded earlier today by the excellent statement of the Senator from Maryland the difficulty in getting law enforcement people to work in many of the areas in the communities in Baltimore. There are important  public responsibilities and services. We have a generation of young people who are prepared to do it. The principal thing that is blocking them is the limitation on their salaries. As we have seen, this chart gives you a pretty good example. A starting salary for teachers is $35,000,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are going to get a $10,000 forgiveness. This is not taxpayer money, Mr. President; this is the lenders' money. I hope the amendment will not be accepted.</paragraph>

LIMITATION ON GENERAL POWERS: FAIRNESS DOCTRINE.</narrative>
  <narrative> "Notwithstanding section 303 or any other provision of this Act or any other Act authorizing the Commission to prescribe rules, regulations, policies, doctrines, standards, or other requirements, the Commission shall not have the authority to prescribe any rule, regulation, policy, doctrine, standard, or other requirement that has the purpose or effect of reinstating or repromulgating (in whole or in part) the requirement that broadcasters present opposing viewpoints on controversial issues  of public importance, commonly referred to as the `Fairness Doctrine', as repealed in General Fairness Doctrine Obligations of Broadcast Licensees, 50 Fed. Reg. 35418 (1985).".&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300024" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this bill is about educating young people. Let them have unfettered access to information. This bill would prohibit the Government from monitoring ideas on our public airwaves and penalizing broadcasters who don't meet the Government's definition of fair and balanced. There is a reason why our first amendment is freedom of speech because all freedoms are at risk when Government monitors and controls the broadcast of ideas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the end of the fairness doctrine in 1987, talk radio has flourished because of consumer-driven market demand, not because of Government command, not because of Government control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am offering this amendment which will protect America's constitutionally granted right to free speech. It will prohibit the FCC from reinstituting the fairness doctrine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of the day, there is nothing fair about the fairness doctrine. This issue is not which broadcaster is fair and which is not. The issue is who decides. I believe fairness is what the American public decides is fair, not some Washington politician or bureaucrat. Americans love a fair fight, but there is nothing fair if the intent is to silence debate because a politician disagrees with it.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an amendment numbered 2351.</narrative>
  <narrative> At the appropriate place, insert the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. __. SENSE OF SENATE ON THE DETAINEES AT GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) During the War on Terror, senior members of al Qaeda have been captured by the United States military and intelligence personnel and their allies.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Many such senior members of al Qaeda have since been transferred to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) These senior al Qaeda members detained at Guantanamo Bay include Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was the mastermind behind the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which killed approximately 3,000 innocent people.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) These senior al Qaeda members detained at Guantanamo Bay also include Majid Khan, who was tasked to develop plans to poison water reservoirs inside the United States, was responsible for conducting a study on the feasibility of a potential gas station bombing campaign inside the United States, and was integral in recommending Iyman Farris, who plotted to destroy the Brooklyn Bridge, to be an operative for al Qaeda inside the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) These senior al Qaeda members detained at Guantanamo Bay also include Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who was an al Qaeda operations chief for the Arabian Peninsula and who, at the request of Osama bin Laden, orchestrated the attack on the U.S.S. Cole, which killed 17 United States sailors.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) These senior al Qaeda members detained at Guantanamo Bay also include Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, who played a major role in the East African Embassy Bombings, which killed more than 250 people.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) The Department of Defense has estimated that of the approximately 415 detainees who have been released or transferred from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, at least 29 have subsequently taken up arms against the United States and its allies.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, said in his 1998 fatwa against the  United States, that "[t]he ruling to kill the Americans and their allies--civilians and military--is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) In the same fatwa, bin Laden said, "[w]e--with God's help--call on every Muslim who believes in God and wishes to be rewarded to comply with God's order to kill the Americans and plunder their money wherever and whenever they find it".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) It is safer for American citizens if captured members of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations are not housed on American soil where they could more easily carry out their mission to kill innocent civilians.</narrative>
  <narrative> (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that detainees housed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, including senior members of al Qaeda, should not be released into American society, nor should they be transferred stateside into facilities in American communities and neighborhoods.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> The Republican leader.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, 6 years ago no one would have thought about deliberately bringing terrorists into American communities, but some of our friends on the other side of the aisle feel differently. The senior Senator from California actually has proposed that we require the President to move terrorist detainees held at Guantanamo Bay to the continental United States and to keep them here. That means moving them into facilities in cities and small towns in places such as California  and Illinois and Kentucky. I can guarantee that my constituents don't want terrorists housed in their backyards in Fort Knox, Fort Campbell or, for that matter, anywhere else in the Commonwealth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would allow the Senate to express its view that it is better for the safety and the security of the American people that the terrorists at Guantanamo Bay are not moved into American communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment does not prohibit moving the terrorists elsewhere. It does not rule out closing Guantanamo Bay, although my personal view is that is a bad idea. All it does is say to the American people the Senate does not want these terrorists housed on our soil in our communities.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The time of the Senator has expired.</chair>
  <chair>Madam President, there has been no shortage of public debate about the detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay. Unfortunately, much of the public debate seems somewhat at odds with what is really going on. As Morris Davis wrote in a recent editorial in the New York Times, "critics liken Guantanamo Bay to Soviet gulags, but reality does not match their hyperbole." Indeed, after an inspection last year by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a Belgian police official said,</chair>
  <chair>My trip to Guantanamo confirmed what Mr. Davis and many others have concluded. When I visited Guantanamo, the first detainee I came across was working out on a recumbent exercise bike.</chair>
  <chair>It is worth listening to some of the complaints registered by detainees themselves. One high-value detainee has alleged that he and others were given "cheap branded, unscented soap." Perhaps the U.S. military should have provided the detainees with St. Ives Apricot Scrub or Bath &amp; Body Works Sun-Ripened Raspberry shower gel.</chair>
  <chair>Mr. President, concerns over scented soap aside, the fundamental question is, what do we do with the detainees? There are several options I am willing to consider. I am willing to consider more aggressive repatriation efforts, for example. Or perhaps modifying the current facility or moving the detainees housed there to another overseas facility. One approach I oppose, however, is shipping these terrorists to our own shores. I am confident that most Kentuckians would not want al-Qaida housed  down the street from them, and I would assume citizens from other States feel the same way.</chair>
  <chair>To me, the fundamental question in taking any action regarding Guantanamo should be: does this step make the American people safer? Accordingly, does bringing al-Qaida to America constitute the best way to protect the American people? I myself am heartened that 528 miles of ocean separates these dangerous men from the United States.</chair>
  <chair>It is perhaps worth recalling that these al-Qaida detainees take their instructions from Osama bin Laden. These are the words of their leader in his 1998 fatwa against the United States: "The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies--civilians and military--is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it."</chair>
  <chair>Here is more guidance from bin Laden to his supporters: "We--with God's help--call on every Muslim who believes in God and wishes to be rewarded to comply with God's order to kill the Americans and plunder their money wherever and whenever they find it."</chair>
  <chair>It is because of words like these and actions like 9/11 that our policy in the global war on terror has been to keep al-Qaida out of this country. Better to fight them abroad than in the U.S. Yet now some on the other side of the aisle would require that we bring terrorists to the heartland of America and house them near our very own citizens.</chair>
  <chair>Lest we forget, these Guantanamo detainees include Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. As most of us know, KSM, as he is called, was the mastermind behind the attacks of September 11, 2001. This attack killed approximately 3,000 innocent men, women, and children.</chair>
  <chair>These detainees also include Majid Khan. Mr. Khan was tasked to develop plans to poison water reservoirs inside the United States and was responsible for studying how to carry out a gas station bombing inside America. He also recommended Iyman Faris to al-Qaida. Iyman Faris, it will be recalled, was the man who plotted the destruction of the Brooklyn Bridge.</chair>
  <chair>These detainees also include Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. Mr. al-Nashiri was responsible for orchestrating the attack on the USS Cole, which killed 17 U.S. sailors.</chair>
  <chair>These detainees also include Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani. Mr. Ghailani played a major role in the East African Embassy bombings which left over 250 people dead.</chair>
  <chair>Nor should we forget that approximately 415 detainees have been transferred out of Guantanamo. Of these, no less than 29 have subsequently taken up arms against the United States and its allies.</chair>
  <chair>The senior Senator from California and other Democratic colleagues, however, proposed an amendment to the Defense Department authorization bill just last week that would mandate that we bring these terrorists into our own communities all across America, in cities and small towns in States like California and Illinois and Kentucky. There, they could either escape or litigate their way to freedom and then be among the innocent Americans they have sworn to kill. I guarantee you my constituents do  not want terrorists housed in their backyards in Fort Knox, Fort Wright, or anywhere else in the Commonwealth.</chair>
  <chair>The Feinstein proposal reflects a pre-9/11, "criminal justice" approach to fighting terror. The amendment I offer today to <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the Education Reconciliation bill, reflects quite a different view; a post-9/11 understanding of terrorism; a view that recognizes the profound and enduring peril that terrorism poses to the U.S. and its citizens. My amendment is simply a sense of the senate that the detainees housed at Guantanamo should not be released into American society or transferred stateside  into facilities near American communities and neighborhoods.</chair>
  <chair>For those who wish to close or modify the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, however, my amendment is not a status quo amendment. As I discussed, my amendment would permit the administration to handle the detainees in other ways. All my amendment would do is to assure the American people that the United States Senate does not want these terrorists housed on our soil, in our communities.</chair>

FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) The right of employees under the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) to choose whether to be represented by a labor organization by way of secret ballot election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board is among the most important protections afforded under Federal labor law.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) The right of employees to choose by secret ballot is the only method that ensures a choice free of coercion, intimidation, irregularity, or illegality.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) The recognition of a labor organization by using a private agreement, rather than a secret ballot election overseen by the National Labor Relations Board, threatens the freedom of employees to choose whether to be represented by a labor organization, and severely limits the ability of the National Labor Relations Board to ensure the protection of workers.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC.

    <paragraph>Mr. President, as our Nation's college graduates head out into the workforce, many of them will be faced with the question of whether they should join a union. Some will get to make that decision by secret ballot, while others will not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is very simple. It guarantees that every American worker will get a secret ballot election when deciding whether to join a union. This is especially important because there are some in this body who want to take this right away and conduct union elections by card check. This approach would open workers to harassment, intimidation, and other forms of union pressure. We need safeguards to allow employees to freely choose without intimidation and coercion from union bosses.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I could ask the distinguished Senator from Maine to withhold for a brief statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have talked to Senators on both sides of the aisle. I think it is appropriate we finish this legislation tonight, or in the morning, whatever the case will be. But we are going to continue working tonight. I think that is the most appropriate thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The one thing I have asked for--and I hope the minority can complete that--is that we should have a finite list of amendments, so we at least can get that done and find out how many amendments we have to work through. I would hope the minority would work on that to see if we can come up with a finite list of amendments before final passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, an alert citizenry is one of our best defenses against terrorist attacks. That is why the New York City subway system has signs saying: "See Something, Say Something."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is just what a group of airline passengers did recently in reporting suspicious activity they thought represented a terrorist threat. What was the result? Those passengers, the pilot, the airline, and the airport were all sued. The Collins-Kyl-Lieberman amendment would protect individuals from lawsuits when they, in good faith, report reasonable suspicious behavior that may reflect terrorist activity.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment is not germane. It is subject to the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. I would be happy to hold hearings on it. This is so overbroad that you could have all kinds of problems. It could invite racial and religious profiling. Suppose somebody is wearing religious garb and it frightens somebody. They could immediately--or maybe it doesn't frighten them, but they could say it does. It broadly protects Government officials from potential misconduct.  It sets a new standard for a government official responding to reports of activity, and it is basically a court-stripping bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this is for more than a political point on this bill, fine, bring it to the Judiciary Committee. We will hold a hearing on it before the committee that has jurisdiction.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Many of the individuals were convicted of the crime of terrorism. Some  were individuals who jeopardized intelligence gathering. Some were family members and represented by family.</paragraph>

This is about the future of this next generation, their hopes and their dreams. It is about our country and being able to compete in the world. It is about the quality of our Armed Forces, about  getting well-trained, well-educated young people. It is about our institutions, whether they are going to be functioning and working.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why can't we go ahead and vote on this legislation? We were here for 2 days waiting for different amendments on education and few of them came. Why in the world are you holding up this legislation that means so much to the future of our young people? We are prepared to vote. We didn't have amendments over here on our side. We want to get this legislation going ahead. We are looking forward to the reauthorization debate for next week, and we are looking forward to getting something worthy of this  institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 45 years I have been in the Senate under the leadership of Stafford of Vermont, of Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, of the Members whom we have had here--we have had true commitment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I do not want to make any of the chairmen and ranking members feel bad, but this committee has a lot of good work they have finished and they will be able to bring to this floor things we have been waiting for for years.

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I hate to be offering an amendment such as this on this bill, but as we know around here, a lot of times we do not get to offer amendments. I wanted to offer my amendment on the immigration reform debate, so we are offering it tonight because it is one of the only chances we will have to offer it this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment denies Social Security benefits for illegal, fraud-based work. It also ensures an individual who is on a visa overstay, or someone who has a card in their name but is working here illegally will not get credit for that illegal work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There have been many media reports recently about illegal immigrants stealing Americans' Social Security numbers. Last year I spoke about Audra, who was a stay-at-home mom since 2000. Over 200 different illegal immigrants stole her identity, used her Social Security number. She ended up owing the IRS over $1 million. That is the kind of thing we have to have stopped. We should not reward those who have stolen people's identities with Social Security benefits.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment is very clear. It reaffirms that illegal immigrants cannot and will not receive Social Security benefits. It focuses the Attorney General to strongly and vigorously enforce this provision, and it focuses enforcement efforts against those who are here illegally, not American citizens who are naturalized and here legally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, whether intended or not, the Ensign amendment would threaten the Social Security benefits of millions of Americans. It makes no sense. We need to focus the Attorney General on those who are here illegally, and make it very clear that no one who is here illegally can receive Social Security benefits, period.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, first I want to address what Senator Kennedy said in case there is misinformation out there in what he said, that MEL MARTINEZ and others would not qualify for benefits under my amendment. That is absolutely false. We have cleared this, we have run the traps on it. It is necessary to make sure that not just someone who is here illegally now who is stealing someone's identity but it is when they become legalized that we want to prevent them from getting  Social Security benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the problem with the Stabenow amendment, that illegals cannot get benefits now. What we want to do is prevent them, if they become legalized--that the work they did when they stole someone's Social Security number, we don't want them to have benefits.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300047" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am going to do something else unusual. I think we have an agreement to voice vote this amendment. Quite frankly, the amendment is pretty simple. I think that is why we are all going to agree to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the current student loan application process you are asked: Have you ever been convicted of a drug offense? That question determines whether or not you are eligible for a period of time to get student loan money. If you have been convicted of simple possession, you are ineligible for a year; the second offense, 2 years; the third offense, indefinite ineligibility. If you sold, first offense, two years of ineligibility from date of conviction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The application has a question that I think makes all this relevant: "Have you ever been convicted" is the question. That has been taken off the application. It needs to stay on. I would urge everyone to support this amendment to keep current law as it is.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I urge our Members to support this amendment. Those who are ineligible because of drug usage, for the Pell grants, will be ineligible under our legislation.

  <narrative>(Purpose: To protect innocent children)</narrative>
  <narrative> At the end, add the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. __X. INNOCENT CHILD PROTECTION.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) In General.--It shall be unlawful for any authority, military or civil, of the United States, a State, or any district, possession, commonwealth or other territory under the authority of the United States, to carry out a sentence of death on a woman while she carries a child in utero.</narrative>
  <narrative> (b) Definition.--In this section, the term "child in utero" means a member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300024" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, my amendment, the protection of the innocent child, will prohibit any level of government--Federal, military, and State governments--from carrying out a death sentence on a pregnant woman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In existing law, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 already prohibits Federal executions of a woman while pregnant. However, this law does not apply to the military or States. In fact, most executions are carried out by States. Additionally, the existing law does not recognize the principle of the unborn child is innocent and, therefore, must be shielded from wrongful execution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment does not reflect any point of view on the desirability or appropriateness of capital punishment. This amendment is grounded in the undeniable fact that a human being is being carried by the pregnant woman and cannot possibly be guilty of a crime and, therefore, should not be subject to the death penalty itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Women do become pregnant in prison, even at maximum security facilities, from sad and unfortunate situations involving rape or having relations with a guard. Congress should prevent the government at any level from taking the life of an innocent human being by prohibiting within all U.S. jurisdictions any death sentence from being carried out when a woman convicted of a capital crime is pregnant.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment that has a great deal to do with education. That is the underlying issue that we are debating tonight. We have an important bill that tries to address accessibility of higher education for millions of Americans, and my amendment addresses that very subject by extending a number of important provisions that are currently in tax law, but they expire in 2010. These are provisions that have broad bipartisan support, provisions that many  in this Chamber have voted for time and again; allowing a $2,000 contribution to educational savings accounts, having an exclusion for your employer if they provide you with education assistance to encourage those employers to foster additional education for their employees; having tax</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300087" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, certainly the sentiments of this amendment are absolutely correct. We certainly want to increase deductibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my friend from New Hampshire knows, I have worked long and hard on this and was able to work with some others--the Senator from Maine and some others--to actually get into law and then get extended a $4,000 tuition deductibility for the vast majority of families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the trouble with this amendment, of course, is not only is it not paid for, but if it were to be added to this bill, it would rob from Peter to give to Paul because it would undo all of the good things in the underlying bill--not just the Pell grants but the excellent provision that says that no one, even of middle income and higher middle income, should pay more than 15 percent of their adjusted earnings when they pay back their student loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I will be offering a second-degree amendment that says we certainly agree with increasing tuition deductibility but not at the expense of what the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from New Hampshire are trying to do.</paragraph>

  <chair>The amendment is as follows:</chair>
  <chair>In the amendment strike all after the first word and insert the following:</chair>
  <chair>It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should provide tax relief to help families afford the cost of higher education, including making tuition deductible against taxes, and eliminate wasteful spending, such as spending on unnecessary tax loopholes, in order to fully offset the cost and avoid forcing taxpayers to pay substantially more interest to foreign creditors; and that such relief should be provided on an appropriate legislative vehicle that won't jeopardize legislation providing greater  access and affordability to higher education for millions of students by subjecting the bill to a "blue slip" by the House.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300095" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, is there time remaining on the second-degree amendment?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Two minutes of debate equally divided.</chair>
  <chair>The Senator from New York is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300087" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this second-degree amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should provide tax relief to help families afford the cost of higher education, including making tuition deductible against taxes and eliminate wasteful spending such as spending on the necessary tax loopholes, in order to fully offset the costs and forcing taxpayers to pay substantially more interest to foreign creditors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do believe on this side in pay-go. We are going to pay for the worthy programs we want to enact and put our fiscal house in order. This amendment expresses that. It expresses the view also that we should not jeopardize that, because if this amendment were to be adopted, it being tax legislation, the bill would be blue-slipped by the House and sent back to the Finance Committee, and all of the good work we have done over the last day or two and the great things that would be done to help those  who need Pell grants and those middle-class students who will have their loan repayments capped will be gone down the drain. That is what the second-degree amendment does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the remainder of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300095" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have three quick points. I certainly trust the Finance Committee. If the Finance Committee believes in all these tax provisions, it could send the bill back expediently, and it could move on its merry way. But the suggestion that doing the right thing on taxes is incompatible with the Senate doing its work is wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, this is a second degree. It is a sense of the Senate that we agree with all these tax provisions. But we don't quite agree enough to actually write them into law. I think that is a little disappointing and disingenuous. I think if we believe this is good policy, it is the right thing to encourage accessibility of higher education, if it is the right thing to do for the 75 percent of filers in that $50,000 to $65,000 range to take advantage of these provisions, we should put it in this  bill and pass it into law, and we should make sure these provisions continue to be accessible to the Americans who use them.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, no one disputes that a key part of America's economy is our ability to innovate and retain the most qualified workers, especially in areas such as math, science, and engineering. There is one step Congress can take this year to help provide at least temporary relief. My amendment would allow the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security to recapture unused employment-based visas. These unused visa numbers would go to nurses, physical therapists, and  other key areas for people with extraordinary ability with advanced degrees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would also include a one-time H-1B visa increase of 115,000 for fiscal year 2008 only, given if that cap was hit in the first day this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment will go a long way to help provide the legal workers who are the lifeblood of the U.S. economy. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this H-1B visa issue was debated during the course of the immigration bill. We decided to increase the number of the H-1B visas but also increase the safeguards against abuse. We know abuses are taking place. We wanted to be sure American workers have first chance at these jobs, No. 1; and, No. 2, we want to stop these foreign job shops that are using thousands of these H-1B visas to outsource jobs in the United States then back to their home country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>None of those reforms are included. All we have is an increase in the H-1B visa numbers. We need a balanced and coordinated approach that increases the numbers with the safeguards. Unfortunately, Senator Cornyn's amendment does not do that, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane. Therefore, I raise a point of order pursuant to section 305(b)(2) and section 310(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I may have an amendment that we can actually all agree on tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of my colleagues know, the infant adoption tax credit is a powerful tool that is making it possible for thousands of American families to open their homes to children in need. I know everyone here agrees with me that there is nothing more important than for a child to have someone to call a mom and a dad. There is nothing more important to the success of education than a good family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the current adoption tax credit is scheduled to sunset in 2010. If we don't make this tax relief permanent, adoption taxes will go up and many American families will not be able to afford the expenses associated with adoption, which are now between $10,000 and $25,000. I wish to thank all the people in this Chamber who have done so much for the cause of adoption, especially Senator Landrieu, Senator Craig, and Senator Bunning, whose amendment we are actually  bringing up today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, a very basic and fundamental issue. This is a constitutional issue. The taxes that are raised result in a blue slip, which effectively is automatically exercised. The chairman of our Budget Committee, the Senator from North Dakota, understands this and understands it well. It effectively ends the bill. It effectively ends the bill constitutionally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the Senator from Louisiana is going to have an alternative. There are only three tax provisions, but the tax provisions that are offered effectively result in what is a constitutional blue slip. I have not talked about killer amendments or poison pills, I am talking about this constitutionally.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an amendment numbered 2363 to amendment No. 2362.</narrative>
  <narrative>Strike all after the first word and insert:</narrative>
  <narrative>It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should permanently extend the adoption tax credit and eliminate wasteful spending, such as spending on unnecessary tax loopholes, in order to fully offset the cost and avoid forcing taxpayers to pay substantially more interest to foreign creditors; and that such relief should be provided on an appropriate legislative vehicle that won't jeopardize legislation providing greater access and affordability to higher education for millions of students by subjecting  the bill to a "blue slip" by the House.</narrative>
  <chair> The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 1 minute.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I offer this second-degree. I appreciate the Senator's compliments about the work we have done to put this tax credit on the books. It is a very important tax credit, but if we are going to have it, we need to pay for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem with the first-degree amendment is it is not paid for and it is going to jeopardize the underlying bill. So, yes, we do need to extend this tax permanently but not on this bill and not tonight, and we need to find a way to pay for it. That is why I am offering this amendment as a second-degree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask all of us who are supporting it to vote for the second-degree amendment.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from South Carolina.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her comments as well. We all know adoption is an important issue. I wish the situation were such in the Senate that we could bring this up at a different time. As we look forward to between now and the rest of this year and, frankly, through 2008, it is going to be very difficult to get this amendment up. We know the process of getting back to the Finance Committee and then back as part of this bill will not bring this bill down. I encourage  my colleagues to look at the greater good, the issue here. There is no reason we can't create some predictability with the adoption tax credit so we can continue to grow the number of adoptions in this country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I am proposing a commonsense measure to uphold the integrity of Federal elections. My amendment to require voters to show photo identification at the polls would go a long way in minimizing potential for voter fraud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When a fraudulent vote is cast and counted, the vote of a legitimate voter is cancelled. This is wrong, and my amendment would help ensure that one of the hallmarks of our democracy, our free and fair elections, is protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision was approved by the Senate in the 109th Congress when it was filed by Minority Leader McConnell, who I am proud to have as a cosponsor of this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opinion polls repeatedly confirm that Americans overwhelmingly support this initiative. I strongly encourage my colleagues to stand with the American people and support this measure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise to speak against this measure. If one would want to suppress the election, suppress the vote in the 2008 election, one would vote for this because this measure goes into effect January 1, 2008. It provides that everybody who votes essentially would have to have a photo ID. If you want to suppress the minority vote, the elderly vote, the poor vote, this is exactly the way to do it. I urge a "no" vote. Many of these people do not have driver's licenses.  This amendment would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to actually carry out. It is a grant program to the States, but it goes into effect--surprise--January 1, 2008. I urge a "no" vote.</paragraph>

REPEAL OF INDIVIDUAL ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) In General.--Section 55(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to alternative minimum tax imposed) is amended by adding at the end the following new flush sentence:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "For purposes of this title, the tentative minimum tax on any taxpayer other than a corporation for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2007, shall be zero.".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Modification of Limitation on Use of Credit for Prior Year Minimum Tax Liability.--Subsection (c) of section 53 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to credit for prior year minimum tax liability) is amended to read as follows:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(c) Limitation.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(1) IN GENERAL.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the credit allowable under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess (if any) of--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(A) the regular tax liability of the taxpayer for such taxable year reduced by the sum of the credits allowable under subparts A, B, D, E, and F of this part, over&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(B) the tentative minimum tax for the taxable year.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(2) TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING AFTER 2007.--In the case of any taxable year beginning after 2007, the credit allowable under subsection (a) to a taxpayer other than a corporation for any taxable year shall not exceed 90 percent of the regular tax liability of the taxpayer for such taxable year reduced by the sum of the credits allowable under subparts A, B, D, E, and F of this part.".</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam President, the AMT patch that protected most taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax expired on December 31 of last year. As a result, 15 million additional taxpayers on top of the 4 million taxpayers already subject to AMT are subject to the tax this year. This bill affords us an opportunity to correct the problem now, and we should. We are halfway through the year, and the tax is adding up. The AMT should be repealed as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The text of my amendment is identical to a bill introduced by Senator Baucus on January 4. It is <bill type="s" number="55">S. 55</bill>. Very simply, the bill would repeal the individual AMT without any revenue offsets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his introductory statement, Senator Baucus noted that the AMT is a "monster that really cannot be improved. It cannot be made to work right." I agree with him. That is why the Senate should vote to repeal the AMT now, before it overwhelms the middle class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I believe the Chair will rule it is not germane to this bill, I would suggest to my colleagues it is propitious; that this bill gives us the opportunity to act now to repeal this tax.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I say to my colleagues, if you want to kill this bill, this is the way to do it. If your real intention is to eliminate the educational assistance for millions of young people in America, vote for this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everybody knows what is at stake. The Constitution provides revenue bills must begin in the House of Representatives. To begin it here violates the blue slip process, violates the Budget Act, and will kill this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us know the AMT has to be fixed. In the budget we have passed it is fixed. It will be fixed by consideration in the Finance Committee, which is where alternatives for fixing it should be considered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not the time. It is not the place. It violates the Budget Act. It violates the constitutional requirement for the initiation of revenue measures. I hope my colleagues will resist the Kyl amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <chair>The amendment is as follows:</chair>
  <chair>Strike all after the first word and insert:</chair>
  <chair>It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should provide relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax to prevent the expansion of the AMT to nearly 23 million taxpayers in 2007 and eliminate wasteful spending, such as spending on unnecessary tax loopholes, in order to fully offset the cost of such repeal and avoid forcing taxpayers to pay substantially more interest to foreign creditors; and that such relief should be provided on an appropriate legislative vehicle that won't jeopardize legislation  providing greater access and affordability to higher education for millions of students by subjecting the bill to a "blue slip" by the House.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, if we are going to vote--and clearly this is blue slip material--No. 1., No. 2, it is not germane. And No. 3, it is not paid for. Madam President, $872 billion is what is contained in that. So if we are going to do the AMT, which all of us believe we ought to do, we ought to do it in a responsible way that raises the question of unnecessary spending, closing tax loopholes, and doing what is necessary to try to pay for this. That is what my amendment suggests. If you  want to vote somehow to do something about the AMT, let's vote in a responsible way, do it in a way that repeals those loopholes, looks at the Tax Code, and pays for that purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So accordingly, Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Madam President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will suggest that under the Budget Act the proposed second-degree amendment is not germane. Let me make two comments about it first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is responsible for us to repeal the AMT in the way the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee has proposed to this body in <bill type="s" number="55">S. 55</bill>. I happen to be a cosponsor of that bill. I think it is a very good idea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is true it repeals the AMT without any revenue offsets. I happen to believe, as the chairman of the Finance Committee does, that is a responsible action, given the number of Americans who otherwise would be subject to the tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I appreciate the notion that a sense of the Senate that we should do tax relief on AMT would be a good thing for this body to do, one of two things will happen. Either the blue slip issue will not be a problem because it will not be raised and we can, in fact, use this vehicle to accomplish this result now or it will and, in effect, my amendment would have been the equivalent of a sense of the Senate.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400629" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I first want to thank my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, for his leadership in bringing a bill to the floor to make college more affordable for millions of students. I also want to thank him for the example he has set over many years in standing up repeatedly to protect the interests of the students of America, and in so doing, to work tirelessly for the future benefit of our economy and our country. I am fortunate to now serve on the Senate  HELP Committee and have seen first hand the efforts of Senator Kennedy and his counterpart on the minority side, Senator Enzi. I appreciate their effort, the hard work of their capable staffs, and the bipartisan collegiality that allows us today to provide much needed support to the college students of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The success of our Nation's youth increasingly requires a college diploma. But that diploma is becoming, for many, ever more difficult to attain. That difficulty arises not from lack of ambition or lack of ability. Increasingly, the difficulty arises from lack of any realistic way for many American families to afford the college education needed for the success of their daughters and sons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The math here is simple. College costs have increased, but family incomes have not, nor has the Federal commitment to provide financial aid. The cost of college continues to increase for many reasons. Over the past 5 years, the cost of a 4-year public college in my State increased 47 percent. At private colleges in Illinois, the increase was 27 percent. Incomes have increased little, and so even with financial aid, 35 percent of a family's income is needed each year to pay for attendance at a  4-year public university in my State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Federal student aid has not kept pace with these increased costs. The proportion of college expenses met by Pell grants decreased from 47 percent to 29 percent over a recent 5-year period for students in my State. Students are increasingly forced to rely on loans, and college graduates are increasingly burdened by debt. Graduates from a 4-year college in Illinois owe, on average, over $17,000 in student loan debt. That is the average.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resulting difficulty in financing a college education impacts not only the dreams of millions of students but also the future of our country. Capable high school graduates from low- and moderate-income families are much less likely to earn a college degree than their wealthier peers. Yet competition in the global economy requires that our students attain a college degree, whether to become engineers or entrepreneurs, in order to maintain the creative and competitive workforce America needs.  And for those students who do make it through college, their large debt loads make it difficult for them to choose occupations which might serve the public good but might not pay enough. Student debt is too often limiting options for those very students who should have the greatest opportunities and whose talents might provide the greatest good to society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must change this. The bill we are considering here today is a step in that direction. With it, we expand loan forgiveness for graduates who enter public service, we increase the threshold for income that may be earned by students receiving financial aid, and we make other significant changes. But most importantly, we increase college access by increasing the amount of support for students through increased grant aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My support of this legislation today echoes the first piece of legislation I introduced in the Senate. That was the Higher Education Opportunity through Pell grant Expansion Act of 2005 the HOPE Act, which called for a significant increase in the maximum Pell Grant to $5,100, financed by decreased Federal subsidies to banks and lenders. The bill we debate today would provide that increase to $5,100 by next year and further increase the maximum to $5,400 by 2011. I applaud Mr. Kennedy  and my colleagues on the HELP Committee for keeping this the main focus of the benefits provided in this package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I realize that we are asking lenders to dig a little a deeper to help students, to come up with innovative ways to continue to provide services students, even while receiving lower subsidies from the Federal Government. But I have faith that they can do this, to the benefit of our students and our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to soon considering the remainder of the comprehensive package to improve higher education contained in the Higher Education Amendments of 2007. But for today, I am proud today to support this bill to bring needed assistance to college students, and I urge my colleagues to join in this effort.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I speak today in support of the Higher Education Access Act of 2007, a bipartisan piece of legislation that will increase student aid by billions of dollars by curbing Federal subsidies to private banks and lenders. This is a significant victory for students around the country and in my State of Wisconsin, which will receive over $270 million dollars in new need-based grant aid by the year 2013. Wisconsin has a world-class higher education system, and I am pleased  to support this much-needed legislation that will help open the doors to college for more students in my State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have long supported and led efforts in Congress to expand the availability of student aid and ensure that qualified students have access to a postsecondary education, including raising the individual Pell grant award. I was pleased to join with my colleagues in February to pass a significant increase in the maximum Pell grant award to $4,310 from $4,050, the first increase in 4 years. Earlier this year, I also joined with my colleagues, Senators Kennedy,  Collins,  and Coleman, to lead letters to both the Budget and Appropriations Committees that advocated for the highest possible increase in funding for Pell grants. The Pell grant program provides need-based aid to low income students, and I am pleased that the Higher Education Access Act retains the Pell grant's focus on need-based aid for low-income students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Access to a higher education is increasingly important in the competitive, global environment of the 21st century workforce as an increasing number of jobs require education or training beyond high school. But while the importance of attending college continues to increase, the cost of attending college also continues to increase, which often causes financial strain on students and their families as they seek to finance the cost of higher education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues and I have long fought against the declining purchasing power of the Pell grant by supporting substantial increases in the maximum grant award. According to data from the Department of Education, the maximum Pell grant covered half the cost of tuition, fees, room and board at public 4-year colleges 20 years ago but only covered a third of these same costs during the 2005 to 2006 period. The declining power of the Pell has impacted my State of Wisconsin as well. In 1986 to 1987,  the $2,100 maximum Pell grant covered 58 percent of college costs for Wisconsin students. In 2005-06, the $4,050 maximum Pell grant only covered 38% of college costs in Wisconsin. This legislation seeks to address the declining purchasing power of the Pell grant by funding new Promise grants which will supplement the Pell grant awards received by students throughout the country and target need-based funds to Pell-eligible students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the declining purchasing power of need-based aid like Pell, the availability of such need-based grant aid does not come close to meeting the demand for it. As a result, an increasing number of students turn to Federal and private loans to finance their education. According to the College Board, in the late 1970s, over three-fourths of the Federal aid to students were grants, while 20 percent of Federal student aid were loans. Recent data from the College Board indicates that the  breakdown between grant aid and loans had switched by 2006, with grant aid only making up 20 percent of the federal student aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Students in my State of Wisconsin, like students in other parts of the country, are greatly affected by the Federal Government's increased reliance on student loans at the expense of grant aid. The Project on Student Debt reports that more than 60 percent of Wisconsin graduates in 2005 graduated with debt and the average student who graduated from a 4-year college in my State in 2005 owed over $17,000. While the prospect of these large debt burdens impact many students' decisions about whether  to attend college, low-income students may be even less inclined to attend college if they have to take out large amounts of student loans. These students are understandably nervous about the significant debt burden they would have to undertake, and some students</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Higher levels of debt can also influence the decisions students make about whether to take a job in the public interest sector or in the more-lucrative private sector after graduation. We have all heard about students who are interested in working in public interest jobs fields like teaching, law enforcement, legal aid, or State and local government but who decide against taking these public interest jobs because of their high debt loads. It is unfortunate that so many students are forced to  consider their debt loads when deciding which jobs to take or pursue. The loan forgiveness and income-based repayment provisions of this legislation will help those graduating students in Wisconsin and around the country who want to pursue careers in public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I applaud much of the policy included in this measure, I am disappointed that we are again seeing the reconciliation process used to advance legislation that is not primarily a deficit-reduction package. While there are better arguments for using reconciliation to consider this particular bill than there were for the reconciliation protection proposed for the legislation to open up the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, I am still troubled by the use of this extraordinary procedure  as a way to advance a significant policy change that is not primarily a deficit reduction package. Thanks to the efforts of our Budget Committee chairman, Senator Conrad, the days when the reconciliation process could be totally subverted to protect legislation that actually worsened the deficit are over. I also commend Chairman Conrad for insisting during the conference</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A student's access to higher education should not depend on his or her family's income but, rather, on the student's desire to obtain a higher education. Passage of the Higher Education Access Act of 2007 moves our Nation in the right direction and represents a great victory for students in my State of Wisconsin and around the country. I have long led and supported efforts to expand Federal higher education programs, including Pell and TRIO, and I am pleased to support passage of this legislation.  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming months and years to continue to expand important need-based grant programs so that hard-working students will be able to take advantage of the full opportunities that access to a higher education offers.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to express my support for the Higher Education Access Act of 2007. I applaud Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Enzi for their work on crafting this bill that will widen access to higher education by providing for increased funding assistance available to American students for their higher education studies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The need for these improvements by now should be as clear to the Senate as it is to America's families. In recent years average college tuition rates have been rising faster than inflation and outpacing student financial aid. Skyrocketing tuitions are pricing our families out of their ability to afford higher education. This trend not only closes doors to opportunity in the lives of the Nation's young people; it also poses harsh consequences on our country and our communities, in ways that are  evident across our economy. I am pleased that, in this new Congress, this bill has been brought forward to reverse the direction of recent budgets that have continued to erode the Federal Government's support of higher education with deep cuts in the funding support for colleges and universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government must rise to the challenge and improve our financial aid programs to ensure that college is an affordable option for all qualified students. No student should be thwarted from enrolling and graduating from college because of financial concerns. This bill accomplishes this goal through need-based grant aid to students by raising the maximum Pell grant to $5,100 next year, and up to $5,400 by 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because tuition has increased well beyond the rate of student assistance, students today are graduating with staggering debt burdens. With the weight of this debt on their backs, recent college graduates understandably gravitate toward higher paying jobs that allow them to pay back their loans. Unfortunately, all too often these jobs are not in the arena of public service or areas that serve the vital public interests of our communities and of our country. We need to be doing more to support  graduates who want to enter public service, be it as a child care provider, a doctor or nurse in the public health field, or a police officer or other type of first responder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate that the chairman has included strong provisions in this bill that will forgive the debt of borrowers who continue in public service careers  such as nursing, teaching, or law enforcement for 10 years. Under this bill, a starting teacher in Vermont earning less than $30,000, and with debt of $20,000, could have his or her loan payments capped at 15 percent, reducing monthly payments by almost 40 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The increases for student aid in this bill are paid for by reducing the subsidies the government provides to lenders. I believe that increasing student assistance should be our highest priority in this bill and that this offset is a worthy and sensible exchange. However, while this bill reduces the subsidies for lenders, I am pleased that it recognizes the importance of not-for-profit lenders, by differentiating between the size of cuts intended for for-profit and for nonprofit lenders. Several  States have established not-for-profit State agencies to administer financial aid and to provide their residents and students attending their schools with quality counseling services and low-cost loans. Vermont pioneered this movement by creating the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation more than 40 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do have concerns with the auction proposal contained within this bill. I am worried that it could potentially prevent Vermonters from exercising their right to choose where to borrow money by requiring the Secretary of Education to conduct an auction to select two lenders that will be permitted to make parent loans. Bids will be sealed, invisible to the public and to Congress, and awards will be made solely on the Secretary's determination of who offers the lowest cost to the government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do not want to crowd out the not-for-profit agencies from providing PLUS loans to families in their State. I am hopeful that the chairman and ranking member will be willing to work on this portion of the bill in order to continue to recognize the important role of not-for-profit lenders.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today in support of the higher education reconciliation bill that would increase critical grant aid to our Nation's neediest college students, help make loan repayment more manageable and encourage students to pursue careers in public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is crucial that we help make college more affordable and accessible for students at a time when they are struggling to pay skyrocketing college costs and taking on more debt to pay for school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In California alone, the cost of attending a 4-year public college increased 43 percent between the school years of 2000-2001 and 2005-2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, 46 percent of California students graduating from 4-year colleges in the 2004-2005 school year had student loan debt--at an average of over $15,200. Nationwide, almost two-thirds of all 4-year college graduates had loan debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is even more concerning is that many students are being shut out of college altogether.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, more than 400,000 low and moderate income high school graduates who are fully prepared to attend a 4-year college do not do so because of financial barriers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is imperative that all students seeking a college education have an opportunity to achieve their goals and this bill takes important steps to provide much-needed relief to students across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, this bill would: Provide $17.3 billion in new grant aid to low-income college students. Increase the maximum award for Pell grant recipients to $5,100 in 2008 and to $5,400 in 2011. The current amount is $4,310 and this means low-income California students will be eligible for an additional $290.9 million in need-based grant aid next year, and an additional $2.5 billion over the next 5 years. Increase the family income level under which a student is automatically eligible for the  maximum Pell grant from $20,000 to $30,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eliminate the "tuition sensitivity" provision in the Pell grant program's eligibility formula that unfairly penalizes our neediest students who attend low-cost institutions, such as community colleges, from receiving the maximum Pell grant award. In California, over 260,000 community college students would benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was pleased to work with my friend and colleague, Senator Boxer, as the lead cosponsor of legislation to eliminate this unfair provision. Cap Federal student loan payments at 15 percent of a borrower's discretionary income providing needed relief to students with high loan burdens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Provide new loan forgiveness under the Federal direct loan program for individuals in public service careers for 10 years, such as teaching, nursing or law enforcement. It would include Head Start teachers and expands on a proposal that I have been working on for several years to provide loan forgiveness to educators in this important field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eliminates the 3-year limitation on the period for which certain members of the Armed Forces may receive deferments on the interest on their student loans. It also extends this deferment period to cover 180 days after such a member of the Armed Forces is demobilized. Extends the amount of time student borrowers can receive a deferment for economic hardship from 3 to 6 years. Would apply to borrowers who take out their first loan after October 1, 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would bring significant help to many low-income California students and those across the country who would otherwise not be able to afford a college education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A college degree is more important than ever to ensure success in today's global economy and we must help provide students that need it most with the resources necessary to reach their highest potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300084" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I believe that we must provide access to higher education, which still too many hard-working American students cannot afford without the help of Federal financial aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the Higher Education Access Act because it will increase the access to education for many more students. In the 2005 to 2006 academic year, the average cost of a U.S. public college or university was $12,108, with the average Pell grant covering 33 percent of tuition, fees, and room and board. For a West Virginia public college or university in the 2005 to 2006 academic year, the average cost was $9,992, with the average Pell grant covering 41 percent of tuition, fees, and room and  board. A senior in West Virginia graduating from college has an average of $16,041 in student loan debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will help offset that cost. The first provision of the bill will increase the aid available to those students who qualify for Federal assistance. By making changes to the current provisions of the Pell grant program, more low-income students will have the opportunity to pursue higher education that otherwise might have been out of their reach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another vital and helpful component of this legislation is the repayment cap and loan forgiveness program, which would help repay student loans of those individuals who have decided to enter the public sector. Those students who go on to become social workers, public defenders, or teachers in high-need subject areas deserve our help getting the education they need for these essential careers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too often, a college graduate who wants to pursue a career in social work or another aspect of public service may not be able to afford to choose that career because of the low salaries and their high student loan debts. The Higher Education Access Act will address this concern by placing a cap on Federal student loan payments at 15 percent of a borrower's discretionary income, which will bring much needed relief to graduates with excessive loan burdens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, a social worker with one child in West Virginia earning $26,800, with average loan debt of $16,041 would have his or her monthly payments reduced by $107, from $185 to $78, a reduction of 58 percent. We should encourage those willing to work in public service by offering relief from the high cost of student loans when they start off on their careers through the 15-percent cap and loan forgiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 4 years ago, I sponsored legislation with the former Senator Mike DeWine to provide student loan forgiveness for social workers and attorneys in the child welfare system. This legislation reflects our goals and expands it to cover a broader range of public service careers--it is a strong, long-term investment in our communities and families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The act is designed to keep rates for the lenders fair and direct as much help as possible to our students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, 37,297 West Virginia students will receive $103.3 million in Pell grants. If this legislation debated today is enacted into law, West Virginia students in the coming academic year will have access to $19 million more in Pell grants and student aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pell grants have not increased during the past year while the cost of education has increased exponentially. This bold increase in the Pell grant program is needed to keep pace with the changing financial demands of higher learning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Higher Education Access Act will provide hope and opportunity for students in West Virginia and across our country. It represents a commitment to education and a wise investment in our future. This legislation will also encourage public service, a cause to which I have long been dedicated. I am proud to support this bill and hope it will become law this year to improve student aid for the high school seniors who will begin their last year of classes in just a few weeks and all the students  who will follow them.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, as written, the higher education authorization bill takes us down a dangerous fiscal road. Democrats are using a privileged rule that was originally meant to cut the deficit to expand the government instead with more than $19 billion in new mandatory spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ironically, they're trying to paper over this by cutting existing programs that help teachers and students in States like mine to reach a net savings of less than $1 billion. Compare that to previous Congresses, which used reconciliation rules to save nearly $500 billion in 1990, $433 billion in 1993, $118 billion in 1997, and $39 billion in 2005. The Democratic majority is using one of the few budget tools we have for shrinking government and using it to grow government instead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is surprising to say the least--given that the Senate just passed a resolution by unanimous consent saying we wouldn't use these rules for new spending. Democrats conveniently dropped that provision in conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both sides have used reconciliation to move tax policy in the past--Republicans to cut taxes seven times; and Democrats to raise them four times. What's unprecedented here is using it for no other reason than to create new mandatory programs and expand the government--by tens of billions of dollars. These budget shenanigans are standard operating procedure for tax and spenders, but they set an extremely dangerous precedent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I would like to say a word about the programs this bill would cut. Democrats justify the cuts to lender subsidies in the higher ed bill with the old Robin Hood line that the money they plan to take from private lenders will go to students instead. But this just isn't true in places like Kentucky, where the Federal loans of three out of every four borrowers are held by not-for-profits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are groups that don't have profits--they funnel their earning back to borrowers. When you cut subsidies to them, you're cutting subsidies to students, parents, nurses, and National Guard members throughout my State. To Kentuckians, this bill is a reverse Robin Hood: it takes money from our students and funnels it back to Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They know what's going on, and they don't like it, regardless of their political affiliation. I just got a letter from the State Treasurer, Jonathan Miller, who also happens to chair the Kentucky Democratic Party. Here's what he wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"If the additional Federal Family Education Loan Program cuts are enacted, the entire borrower benefits program will be seriously jeopardized, and the impact would be immediate and significant for thousands of Kentucky families who depend upon Kentucky's nonprofit higher education agencies to help make higher education affordable."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Teachers in Kentucky would also get hit: Last year, thousands of teachers in my state received $15 million in student loan forgiveness from non-profit lenders like the Higher Education Student Loan Corporation and the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These benefits are targeted to teachers in high need subjects, like math, science, and special education. The President of the Kentucky Education Association, Frances Steenbergen, has informed me that if these cuts enacted, over 14,000 Kentucky teachers will be impacted immediately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans will have an opportunity to salvage this bill, but it won't be easy. It violates the intent of reconciliation to expand government, and slashes programs that are an enormous help to students and teachers. We'll also use the amendment process to repair some of the damage from yesterday. I think everyone was startled when the Democratic Leadership pulled the Defense Authorization bill from the floor. As the senior Senator from Arizona said, "He was more sad than angry."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here's a bill that would authorize pay raises for the men and women in the military, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected, M-RAP, vehicles for Iraq, and a lot of other urgent military support. Just this week, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee issued a statement decrying delays in the delivery of these M-RAP vehicles--vehicles that have the potential of substantially reducing U.S. casualties in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He sent a letter to the Defense Secretary in which he asked how it was possible "that with our nation at war, with more than 130,000 Americans in danger, with roadside bombs destroying a growing number of lives and limbs, we were so slow to act" in getting this technology to the troops. He should be asking the Democratic leadership today how it could have pulled the plug on a bill that authorizes the production of M-RAP vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He should ask them how they could have complained about the shameful neglect at Walter Reed--and then pulled a bill that addressed the most critical failing in our treatment of wounded soldiers and marines returning from battle He should ask them how they could pull a bill that delays a pay raise for military personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans have an opportunity today to restore this vital support for our military men and women, and we are going to seize it. It's unacceptable to wait: it's now late July and we haven't done a single appropriations bill--not one. The House has done six. At this rate, we won't have sent a single appropriations bill to the President by the time we leave here in August--an outrageous waste of time. These pranks and gimmicks guarantee we will have our backs to the wall in September.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, as this debate comes to a close, I am reminded of the great moments in our Nation's history in which we look to the future and invested in future generations of Americans. We did it when we passed the GI bill. We did it when the Federal Government created the student loan program. We did it when we created Pell grants. And we do it again today with the largest new investment in student aid since the GI bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A vote for this bill is one we can cast with pride and great hope--pride in doing our part for the future of our great country and hope that our actions tonight will mean a better future for millions of young Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By passing this bill tonight, we will recognize that principle once again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that our students today face significant challenges in paying for college. Each year, over 400,000 talented, qualified students do not attend a 4-year college because they cannot afford it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1993, fewer than half of all students took out loans to finance their education, but today, more than two-thirds of students borrow for college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the average student leaves college with more than $19,000 in student loan debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why this higher education legislation is so important. We will provide more than $17 billion to help students and families pay for college. This legislation will help reverse the crisis in college affordability in several ways: It will immediately and dramatically increase the amount of aid for Pell grant recipients; it will help students manage their debt, by capping student loan payments at 15 percent of their monthly income; it will provide longer deferments in loan repayments for  student borrowers facing economic hardship; and it will completely forgive  the loans of those who enter society's most needed professions. It will restore balance to our grossly unfair student loan system by reducing unnecessary subsidies for lenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everything we know about the college affordability crisis tells us that low-income students and families are struggling the most. With this bill, we will increase the maximum Pell grant to $5,100 next year--a $790 increase--and to $5,400 in 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very pleased that our legislation will expand loan forgiveness to borrowers who stay in public service professions for 10 years. Our society needs more teachers, more emergency management and law enforcement professionals, more public health doctors and nurses, more social workers, more librarians, more public interest lawyers, and more early childhood teachers. Under our bill, we will produce more of them, because they--and all the groups I have just mentioned--will be eligible for loan  forgiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us will deliver long-overdue relief to students and families across the Nation who are struggling to afford college. But there is more we can--and must--do to improve higher education for students and families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week, we will take up other important changes in our higher education amendments of 2007. In this bill, we take commonsense steps to improve higher education. We will address the rising cost of college, pursue needed sunshine ethics reforms to the student loan industry, and steps to simplify the federal financial aid application form.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are critical reforms--but the most critical steps are the ones we take tonight to dramatically increase college aid for our Nation's students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From our earliest days as a nation, education has been the engine of the American dream. We can look to the landmark success of the GI bill to see what a difference higher education makes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GI bill produced 67,000 doctors, 91,000 scientists, 238,000 teachers, and 450,000 engineers. It also funded the education of three Presidents, three Supreme Court Justices and about a dozen Senators who served in this very Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is a big step in the right direction. It dedicates over $17 billion for students and families to benefit from a college education and keep our country strong in the years ahead. It will help keep the doors to college open for all students, regardless of income level or background, just as the GI bill did half a century ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can't let the engine of education stall today. More than ever college is the key to opportunity for students and the key to a strong America for the future. I urge the Senate to approve this important legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, we have in wrap-up the agreement that we are not going to do the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to homeland security. We will proceed to that legislation as soon as we complete the additional education bill we are going to work on on Monday. We are working really hard to try to not have a lot of votes Monday night. The first vote will be 5:15. Under the order entered, there could be as many as 12 or 15 votes. We hope that doesn't occur, but it is possible. There  will be multiple votes Monday. We may not be able to complete them all Monday. We hope we can, but that is where we are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tuesday, we will start the Homeland Security appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I tell all Members that we have now 2 weeks left in this work session. As I have indicated from the first day, we are going to do our best to have everybody out of here 2 weeks from tomorrow. We have a lot to do. We have to complete homeland security, work on SCHIP and complete that, we have two conference reports, one on which Senator Lieberman today had a real conference. Democrats and Republicans appointed to the conference sat down to see what they could work out on the 9/11 Commission  recommendations. Progress was made. Senator Lieberman said he thinks that can be done early next week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then I had a number of conversations today with the distinguished Republican leader. We are where we are on the ethics lobbying reform. I wish we could approach it a different way. That is not going to work out, it appears. We are going to attempt to complete that also before we finish this work period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a lot to do, and I know there are things people want to do a week from this weekend. We are going to try to see that they can do that. There are no guarantees. We have to finish this legislation or we will work into the August recess. Those are the choices we have. There will be no votes tomorrow.</paragraph>
