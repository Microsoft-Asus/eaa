  <narrative>THE RETIREMENT OF DR. BILL HOGARTH -- (Senate - December 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="15826">S15826</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, at the end of the year my good friend Dr. Bill Hogarth will be leaving his position as the leader of the National Marine Fisheries Service. Bill is the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and his departure will mark the end of a 6-year tenure in this post.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout Bill's career with the National Marine Fisheries Service, I have had many opportunities to work with him on Fisheries issues critical to the State of Alaska, to the Nation, and to international fisheries management organizations. Bill's knowledge of our fisheries and commitment to science-based management have helped to conserve and rebuild many of our most important fish stocks, both domestically and internationally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last January, the President signed our reauthorization bill for the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act, which mandates an end to overfishing by requiring fisheries management councils to adhere to science-based catch limits. As we wrote that legislation, my colleagues and I worked with Bill to ensure this goal would be met. His expert advice and insight into our Nation's fisheries regulations proved to be indispensable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Alaska, which has half the coastline of the United States and produces half of our Nation's fisheries products, Bill has also demonstrated a firm commitment to both conserving and supporting our State's fisheries. Under his tenure, the fisheries service has invested in the scientific research and facilities that will enable sound conservation of Alaska's fish stocks. Bill has also ensured effective implementation of all fisheries legislation important to our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alaska native communities have also benefited under Bill's leadership. He knows that the survival of our Alaskan villages relies on maintaining access to fisheries and marine mammals, and therefore Bill worked hard to ensure that this access is upheld. At this year's meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Anchorage, during which Bill served as Commission Chairman, he secured the subsistence bowhead whale quota for Alaska Native communities. This was a significant victory at a contentious  meeting, and our communities owe Bill a debt of gratitude for his achievements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that Bill will be remaining on as Chairman of the International Whaling Commission. I look forward to continuing to work with him in this capacity. This will build on his other achievements in the international arena--such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, where, as Chairman, he was at the forefront of the fight against illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing--a serious threat to all global fish stocks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Bill for his many years of service to our fisheries and fishing communities. I also thank him for his cooperation and friendship as we worked to achieve our common goals of fisheries sustainability. I think he has done a grand job for the Nation. I wish Bill and his wife, Mary, all the best in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum. The clerk will call the roll.</paragraph>
