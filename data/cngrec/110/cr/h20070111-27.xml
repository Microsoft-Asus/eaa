  <speaking speaker="400618" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3">H.R. 3</bill>, a bill that I consider a pivotal step toward the fight against devastating and debilitating diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The narrow view of stem cell research espoused by the administration places unrealistic limitations on the medical research capabilities of this Nation. The administration's position on this critical issue leaves patients across the country without the hope that they can be cured of the effects of medical conditions, including but not limited to Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, as well as spinal cord injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every person who has had to watch a mother, a brother, a friend, a family member, knows of this terrible, terrible, difficult problem. I know. I have had that experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These conditions may be curable through stem cell research, but it will only be possible if Congress asks for full-fledged research to take place. We owe it to the afflicted and their families to put forth the best efforts to find cures for these debilitating medical conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the House to put political posturing aside and give hope to patients and families by passing this important measure today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
