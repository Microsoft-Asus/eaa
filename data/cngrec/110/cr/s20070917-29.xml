  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to congratulate the Gladstone All-Star 11-12 Girls Softball Team on placing third in the Little League Softball World Series. Their determined and focused efforts throughout the postseason, which began in early July with the district tournament in Escanaba, have brought a lot of joy and pride to the Gladstone community. I am happy to have this opportunity to recognize this impressive achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gladstone capped a marvelous season with a thrilling come-from-behind 5-2 victory over an excellent team from Waterford, CT. The game was tightly contested throughout and was not decided until the first extra inning when Gladstone rallied to score the deciding three runs in the top of the seventh inning to secure a hard fought win. Gladstone displayed resilience in recovering from a loss the previous day to the eventual runner-up from Elgin, TX, to record this victory. It takes poise, determination,  and teamwork to achieve this level of success, and I congratulate each member of the team on the way  they competed throughout the summer. Gladstone now enjoys the distinction of being the third team from Delta County to reach the Little League Softball World Series.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Girls Little League Softball, which began in 1974, has provided countless young women an opportunity to compete at a high level. Through the instruction they receive on and off the field, these young women gain valuable skills that will help them achieve success throughout their lifetime. The 2007 Gladstone All-Star 11-12 year-old Girls Softball Team includes Jordan Schwartz, Ashley Hough, Jammie Botruff, Heather Sanderson, Jordan Kowalski, Nicole Sharon, Shannon Wolf, Neena Brockway, Alison  Austin, Nikki Barteld, Averi Kanyuh. The coaching staff includes Manager Andrew Schwartz and Assistant Coach John Nevala.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a summer these young women will certainly never forget. I know I am joined by their family, friends and supporters, as well as my colleagues in the Senate, in congratulating the entire team on a highly successful and memorable season. I look forward to hearing about many more successes from these young ladies in the future.</paragraph>
