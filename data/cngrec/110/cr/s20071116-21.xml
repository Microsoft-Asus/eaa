  <narrative>THANKS TO STAFF -- (Senate - November 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14603">S14603</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wanted to thank my staff director of the Senate Budget Committee. The other day I thanked all of those who have worked so hard on the farm bill, the members of my staff, including my lead negotiator and my entire negotiating team; six members of my staff. I did not thank at that time my staff director on the Senate Budget Committee, Mary Naylor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one has worked harder in this Chamber at the staff level to try to get us back on a fiscal track that makes sense than Mary Naylor. She has been with me many years. She was the person who ran all of my budget operations before I became chairman of the Budget Committee, and when I became chairman, I asked her to be the staff director because there is no one for whom I have higher regard than Mary Naylor, and I wanted to thank her formally and publicly today for her extraordinary commitment  to making this country better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.</paragraph>
