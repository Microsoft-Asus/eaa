    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a St. Pete headline says: "Gator Nation: It's A Great Time to be a Gator." The Gainesville Sun boasts: "Gators Made Most of Their Chances." The Miami Herald states: "Gators are First on the Court and First on the Field." The Florida Times Union reads: "The Gators Stand Tall and Deliver; Florida Totally Dominates Ohio in Claiming the National Championship."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Go Gators!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The BCS Championship game between the University of Florida Gators and the Ohio State University Buckeyes last night was a clash of the titans and history in the making.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My alma mater, the University of Florida, became the first school in NCAA history to hold national titles in football and men's basketball at the same time. Only six Division I schools have ever won a football and men's basketball national championship since 1936, and never in the same year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to Head Coach Urban Meyer, the Florida coaching staff, and the outstanding Gator football team, we finished the season with a 13-1 record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to congratulate the University of Florida for not only being the best athletic school in the country but also the best in academia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Gators, through persistent offense and an overwhelming defense, defeated the Ohio State University Buckeyes 41-14. They earned 21 first downs, 370 total yards, and did not turn the ball over on offense. The defense held the opponents to only eight first downs, 82 total yards, and sacked the quarterback five times, for 51 yards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No doubt about it, the best team won the National Championship. Go Gators!</paragraph>
