  <narrative>HONORING THE LATE HON. JULIA CARSON -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H16810]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hill) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400177" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I think it's a true testament to how people felt about JULIA CARSON based upon the fact that the hour has expired allotting time for her colleagues to get up here to say a few kind words about her and now we are in overtime and the hour is over and we still have colleagues on the House floor who want to take the time to eulogize our friend and colleague JULIA CARSON.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have known JULIA for over 25 years. In this business of politics, you have friends and then you have allies. I can, with a great deal of assurance, tell my colleagues here that JULIA was a friend, not just an ally. She was that, too. But I came from a small town in southern Indiana to the Indiana legislature back in 1982; and one of the first people I ever met was from the great city, the large city of Indianapolis, Indiana: JULIA CARSON. And I will be honest with you from  the rural community and the kind of sheltered atmosphere of southern Indiana and small-town Indiana, I, quite frankly, didn't know how to take JULIA CARSON when I first met her. She was something else. But as the years went by and I had the time to serve with JULIA both in the legislature and now here in Congress, I had come to love JULIA CARSON, a true friend. Not just a colleague, but a true friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have all heard the stories about how she was revered in Indianapolis, Indiana. The Indianapolis Star was the newspaper there, and there was some friction between JULIA and the Indianapolis Star because the Indianapolis Star was basically a Republican-leaning newspaper. So there were moments between the Indianapolis Star and JULIA. But just recently the headline in the Indianapolis Star, and it was a large headline, said: "A Warrior for Indianapolis." And that's exactly what  she was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was one of a kind. She had grace and she had flair, and she had a great sense of humor. She was a Hoosier to the core. She was the epitome of everything that Indiana is. And we will miss her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come to this microphone today with mixed emotions: sadness by the loss of JULIA, but also a sense of good memories that we have about JULIA CARSON. The one thread that all of us have been speaking about and I will speak about it too was JULIA was a champion, a champion for the downtrodden and the poor. She made no excuses that she was a liberal in the good sense of the word. She wanted to make life better for all Americans, not just a select few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JULIA, we'll miss you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do believe that when she walked into the pearly white gates, as Congressman Rush said, that the angels applauded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well done, JULIA. We love you and we miss you.</paragraph>
