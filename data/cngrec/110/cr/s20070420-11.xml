    <paragraph>Mr. President, yesterday I spoke to Governor Kaine, Tim Kaine,  the Governor of Virginia, a wonderful man. He is a public servant for all of the right reasons. He has been burdened as Governor of the State with this terrible tragedy at Virginia Tech.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He called me and made sure that we were involved in the decisionmaking he has. He has appointed a blue ribbon panel that is going to look into this situation. It is the right thing to do. He has also asked that the people around the country, at 12 o'clock noon, stand in a moment of silence in memory of the loved and lost in that terrible tragedy in Blacksburg, VA, at Virginia Tech University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a memento of that, many people around the country are wearing the colors of the Virginia Tech Hokies. I am proud to do that. In just a minute, Mr. President, we will stand in silence with the rest of the country in recognition of the tragedy in Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Will the Chair advise me when the hour of 12 noon arrives?</paragraph>
