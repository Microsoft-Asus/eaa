  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have many important issues in front of us. We have been talking a lot about energy this week, including the high cost of gasoline and problems with ethanol mandates and potential problems with the cost of electricity. As we look at ways to reduce pollution, certainly energy is important. We have also been dealing with flood insurance. There is no shortage of issues. But we know as we talk to our constituents around the country that at the top of their list  of priorities is health insurance and health care and the ability to afford the policies that are out there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have differences of opinion in the Senate as to how to deal with the uninsured in our country today. There is one philosophy that believes the government needs to be more involved; we need to expand government control of health care. There is another philosophy of which I am a part which believes that our job in the Senate and in the Congress and in the Federal Government is to make freedom work for everyone, and that includes people having the freedom to own their own health insurance. We  believe when people do not work for a company that offers health insurance, they should have guaranteed access to affordable health insurance policies that they can take from job to job. I am encouraged that Senator McCain is on the side of freedom of choice and individual ownership of plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know if we are going to make individual plans work, we need to address the high cost of insurance. We know that is the biggest impediment to getting coverage when that coverage is not offered through an employer. In fact, nearly two-thirds of the uninsured are the working poor, and they cite the high cost of insurance as the primary barrier to accessing health coverage. We can talk about the uninsured, and we can talk about the high cost of insurance, but we need to address the real causes  of the high cost of insurance. We know if we look at the policies, if we talk to those who offer the policies--the insurance companies--we know that mandates, government mandates on those policies have a lot to do with the high cost of insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>States have passed more than 1,900 benefit mandates requiring insurance companies to cover everything from wigs to infertility treatments to acupuncturists to massage therapists. These may all be legitimate needs, but they are not legitimate mandates on insurance policies. When people are looking for a policy that meets their needs that they can afford, we cannot continue as governments--both State and Federal--to mandate that every policy cover every possible problem when individuals do not  need those mandates to buy the policies they want. These mandates increase the cost of health insurance. According to the Congressional Budget Office, for every 1 percent increase in the cost of health insurance, 300,000 people lose their coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few States are getting the message that mandates make health insurance more expensive. There are at least 10 States that provide for mandate-lite policies which allow individuals to purchase a policy with fewer mandates and so are more tailored to their individual needs and financial situation. There are now at least 30 States that require a mandate's cost to be assessed before it is implemented. These States are getting the message. Mandates are pricing individuals out of the insurance market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have introduced legislation that addresses these growing problems. In December, Congressman JOHN SHADEGG of Arizona joined me in introducing the Health Care Choice Act. This legislation is important because it will allow consumers to shop for health insurance the same way they do for other insurance products. They can shop on line, by mail, over the phone, or in consultation with an insurance agent in their hometown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the bill would let insurers licensed in one State sell to individuals in the other 49 States. Most people are surprised that you can't do that now because in every other product category we can buy products not only in every State but all over the world. But with health insurance, we have taken a different tact, a tact that has made health insurance much more expensive because we allow a few insurance companies to monopolize the market in 50 individual States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we need is a national market for health insurance. Consumers will no longer be limited to picking only those policies that meet their State regulations and mandated benefits. Instead, they can examine the wide array of insurance policies qualified in one State and offered for sale in multiple States. This way, consumers can choose a policy that best suits their needs and their budget without regard to State boundaries. It makes a lot of common sense. Individuals looking for basic health  insurance coverage can opt for a policy with a few benefits they need, and such a policy will be more affordable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the other hand, consumers who have an interest in a particular benefit such as infertility treatments will be able to purchase a policy that includes that benefit. Equally important, it creates incentives for insurance companies to offer innovative and customized insurance products, and it will reduce the number of Americans who have sought but have been unable to afford insurance coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am thrilled that Senator JOHN MCCAIN has made this legislation one of the cornerstones of his health insurance platform because health insurance coverage should not be dictated by State or Federal legislators. Families sitting around their kitchen tables should decide what their health insurance plan should cover. I believe Senator McCain's plan to address the gross health care inequity in the Tax Code and to harness the power of the marketplace through the interstate competition  of insurance products, through that, Americans will be able to find affordable health insurance that offers more choice and better coverage. We know this is true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we talk to insurance companies, if they were allowed to offer products for all 50 States under one set of regulations, or under 50 if they choose, if they are able to have a larger pool of members, they can spread the risk and lower the rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Health Care Choice Act is a commonsense way to let freedom work for every American, to let the free enterprise system work in health insurance as it does in almost every other area of our lives. I encourage my colleagues to consider the Health Care Choice Act and to move away from this idea that more government control, more government mandates is actually going to help us get more Americans insured.</paragraph>
