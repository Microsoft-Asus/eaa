  <narrative>TRAVEL RULES -- (Senate - November 13, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14274">S14274</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to notify all Senators that on Friday, November 9, 2007, the Committee on Rules and Administration approved the request of the Select Committee on Ethics and granted a 3-week extension until December 3, 2007, for the Ethics Committee to issue the initial guidelines implementing the new rules on privately sponsored travel required by Public Law 110-81.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In their letter to the Rules Committee, Senators BOXER and CORNYN note that unless the request is approved, the new travel rules would become effective on November 13, 2007. Due to the scheduling of a number of proposed trips on or shortly after November 13, the Ethics Committee believes that the additional required paperwork would not be submitted in time for review before the trips commence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 3-week extension will afford the Ethics Committee additional time to post the proposed new travel guidelines on its Web site. These guidelines will be effective on December 3, 2007, and all privately sponsored travel beginning on or after that date will be required to conform to the new rules and guidelines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have the letter from the Ethics Committee dated November 7, 2007, printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>U.S. SENATE,</narrative>
  <narrative>SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, November 7, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATORS FEINSTEIN AND BENNETT: Consistent with the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (the "Act"), the Select Committee on Ethics requests that the Committee on Rules and Administration extends until December 3, 2007, the deadline for the Ethics Committee's formal issuance of the initial guidelines implementing the new rules on privately-sponsored travel. (See Section 544(b)(4) of the Act.)</narrative>
  <narrative>The legislative history of the Act provides that the new travel requirements "go into effect 60 days after enactment, or the date the Select Committee on Ethics issues the required guidelines under the rules, whichever is later." Without the requested extension, the new travel rules would become effective on November 13, 2007. The Committee has prepared guidelines and new forms that  must be completed by Senate members and staff, as well as trip sponsors,  30 days prior to their travel. We would be ready to issue these guidelines and forms on November 13. However, a number of proposed trips that have been submitted to the Committee for review begin on or shortly after November 13, and it would be highly unlikely that the additional paperwork could be completed for review by the Committee before these trips begin.</narrative>
  <narrative>If the Committee on Rules and Administration extends the deadline for issuance of the guidelines until December 3, 2007, all privately-sponsored travel beginning on or after that date would be required to conform to the new rules and guidelines.</narrative>
  <narrative>So that privately-sponsored travel starting on or after December 3, 2007, may meet the requirements of the new travel rules, the Committee intends on November 13, 2007, to post on its Web site a preview of the complete text of the new travel guidelines, and related regulations and forms, that the Committee will issue formally on December 3, 2007, if the Committee on Rules and Administrations grants the requested extension.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you for your prompt attention to this request,</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Barbara Boxer,</narrative>
  <narrative>John Cornyn,</narrative>
