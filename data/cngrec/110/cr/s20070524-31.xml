  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of the true stalwarts of this institution an indefatigable legislator, a tireless advocate for his home State of Alaska, a public servant with a lifetime of contribution, and a treasured leader of this venerable Chamber, Senator Ted Stevens who, this past April 13, 2007, became the longest-serving Republican member of the U.S. Senate. Our good friend and colleague has received countless, well-deserved accolades for a tremendous milestone  indeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is fitting that we pay tribute to an esteemed lawmaker whose ongoing legacy and longstanding record of accomplishment over a remarkable span of nearly 39 years of service in the U.S. Senate stand as a testament to the courage, vigor, and sense of duty he feels toward this country and the issues and policies shaping it. TED is a force of nature, steadfast and resolute, in this time-honored body and in our nation's capital. His constituents wouldn't have him any other way, and we wouldn't  either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His legacy of achievement on behalf of Alaskans is as large as the State they call home, and began even before he entered politics when he first moved to Washington, DC, to join the Eisenhower administration. While working for the Secretary of the Interior, he was not only present at Alaska's creation as a State in 1959, but was also instrumental in helping advocate for statehood. As a U.S. Senator, he was essential in championing the development of the Alaskan pipeline which was critical to  his state and to the energy future of the country. He successfully advanced Alaska's infrastructure and transportation capabilities, especially vital to the state that is one-fifth the size of the entire lower 48. Alaska rightfully commemorated Senator Steven's indelible impact in these areas with the dedication of the &lt;em&gt;Ted</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of my State of Maine are especially grateful to Senator Stevens for his landmark legislation that bears his name--the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act our Nation's indispensable fisheries act, which was reauthorized this past January and signed into law. First as the chair, and now the ranking member on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation subcommittee handling fisheries issues, I had the pleasure of working with full committee  chairman and now ranking member Stevens throughout the process to help bring this bill to fruition. From the 300 year-old fishing villages in downeast Maine to remote Aleutian Island outposts, Senator Stevens has always been bound by a commitment to sustain both fish and fishermen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through many Congresses, as both a chairman and ranking member, Senator Stevens has spearheaded and done much to shepherd improvements in the largely uncharted world of telecommunications policy that have been historic and consequential, and which will reverberate for generations. On a personal note, I want to express my debt of enormous thanks to Senator Stevens for his pivotal support in his Universal Service Fund Reform bill of the E-rate program which provides discounted  telecommunications services to schools and libraries. Senator Stevens has been a bulwark catalyst on this initiative, and, as we recently commemorated the 10th anniversary since its inception, I couldn't help but recall with gratitude his crucial role in the wiring schools in my State and across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It must also be noted that in an era of increasing partisanship, Senator Stevens shares an unassailable bond with the senior Senator from Hawaii, a Democrat, Daniel Inouye a friendship, profoundly steeped in their mutual, heroic tours of duty in World War II, which continues to this day as a model example of collegiality, bipartisanship, and comity that transcends politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This decorated Army Air Forces pilot in the storied "Flying Tigers," whose immense devotion to this land and its people extends across six decades, is not one to move to the side or step away when he is fighting for what he believes in or on behalf of his State or in defense of his country. That speaks volumes in explaining Senator Stevens' well-known trademark as he prepares to debate on the Senate floor and  he dons his infamous tie emblazoned  with the Marvel comic book character, The Incredible Hulk!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With hallmark humor, strength, and aplomb, how could he approach his robust role any differently--a man whose larger-than-life tenure in the public arena reflects the enormity of his stunning and beloved Alaska, a State with a name that means literally "the object towards which the action of the sea is directed." For more than half century, the action of the sea of public policy has always found its way to this great American and still does because he welcomes it, thrives on it, and seizes  upon it in the name of The Last Frontier State and to the benefit of our Nation.</paragraph>
