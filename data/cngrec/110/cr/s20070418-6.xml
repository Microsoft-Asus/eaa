    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning there will be 60 minutes available to the Members to discuss the issues on which there will be cloture votes on the two motions to proceed. Time is equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees. At approximately 9:30 a.m, the Senate will vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to <bill type="s" number="3">S. 3</bill>, the prescription drug bill. If cloture is not invoked on that motion, there will be 2 minutes of debate controlled equally  by Senators LEAHY and SPECTER, after which time the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to <bill type="s" number="378">S. 378</bill>, the court security bill. If cloture is invoked on that motion, then I hope the managers can work together for expeditious consideration of this measure. Later I will have more to say about the schedule for the remainder of the week.</paragraph>
