    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in remembrance of President Truman's birthday today, I want to share a speech my grandfather, Representative A.S.J. Carnahan, made on this floor over half a century ago in April 1945 after Truman assumed the Presidency:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Mr. Speaker, my own native State, Missouri, bows with the Nation and the world in sorrow at the loss of the late  President Roosevelt. As we bow in the presence of divine providence and have committed a national leader to the ages, we must carry on. New hands must take up the task of national leadership. Missouri is honored to present to the Nation and the world the new American leader, President Harry S Truman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Born and reared on a Missouri farm, elected county judge, sent to the U.S. Senate, selected by President Roosevelt as a running mate, elected vice president and now President of the United States, it's typically Missourian and typically American. What could more truly represent the American tradition and spirit than from farm boy to President?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"This is the first time my beloved State of Missouri has furnished a President. We are happy it is Harry Truman. His honesty, ability, frankness, experience, and humility fit him for the very heavy tasks which lie ahead. He is equal to the occasion."</paragraph>
