  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:</chair>
  <chair>A resolution (<bill type="sr" number="384">S. Res. 384</bill>) expressing support for the goals of National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month by promoting national awareness of adoption and the children awaiting families, celebrating children and families involved in adoption, and encouraging Americans to secure safety, permanency, and well-being for all children.</chair>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in honor of National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month. Senator Coleman and I understand that later today the Senate will consider our resolution recognizing National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every child should have a loving and permanent family. The Hague Convention recognizes "that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding." Unfortunately, not all children have a family of their own. However, through adoption a child can have a "forever family."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush has recognized the importance of adoption to children and our Nation. Thus, he has declared November to be National Adoption Month. Nearly half of all Americans have been touched by adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2002, 151,332 children found "forever families," a significant increase from 119,766 in 1996. 21,063 of these children were born in another country and adopted by American families. Public agency adoptions have more than doubled since 1995. The National Council for Adoption attributes the increase "in part to the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997's Adoption Incentive Program, which awards financial incentives to States for placing foster children into adoptive homes." Seven States:  Arizona, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Wyoming, quadrupled the annual number of public agency adoptions from 1995 to 2005. Over 7,000 children who are part of the public child welfare system are adopted every year in California, which is the highest number of all 50 States. However, only 10 percent of the 513,000 children in foster care will ever be adopted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National Adoption Day occurs on November 17 as a part of National Adoption Month. National Adoption Day is an event to raise awareness of the 114,000 children in foster care who are waiting for permanent families. Since the first National Adoption Day in 2000, nearly 17,000 children have joined "forever families" on this special day. This year we hope to have events in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Over l90 events in 48 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto  Rico are planned for this Saturday to finalize the adoption of over 3,000 foster children and youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want you to picture what happens on this fall day, children running, laughing, and playing with their new parent. Think about a girl or boy planning their special outfit and joyously awaiting the family celebration. Imagine the excitement welling up inside of a child as she looks into her new parent's eyes and knows she is finally part of a family. She will never dread the sound of a car coming to take her away again or wonder where she will lay her head or which school she will be moved to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now picture the other dramatically different reality. In 2005, there were 514,000 children in foster care and 115,000 of them were waiting to be adopted. The following States have the largest number of children in their foster care system: California, Florida, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Between fiscal years 2000 and 2005, States made progress in reducing the number of children in their foster care systems, such as Illinois, 34 percent reduction, and New York, 35 percent reduction. These children have not had the luxury of their own room, a stable school environment, or a constant adult in their lives. Though the average percentage of children in  foster care who are waiting to be adopted is 24 percent, some States have percentages as low as 5 percent,--California--and as high as 38 percent--New Jersey and South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of the 52,000 foster children who were adopted, 60 percent of them were adopted by their foster parents. According to a recent survey by the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, many potential adoptive parents have considered foster care adoption, but "a majority of Americans hold misperceptions about the foster care adoption process and the children who are eligible for adoption. For example, "two-thirds of those considering foster care adoption are unnecessarily concerned that biological  parents can return to claim their children and nearly half of all Americans mistakenly believe that foster care adoption is expensive, when in reality adopting from foster care is without substantial cost."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Louisiana there are 4,541 children in foster care and 1,162 of them are waiting to be adopted. I would like to tell you about some of the foster children in Louisiana who are looking for their "forever families."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Natalyia is a cute, outgoing and loveable 8-year-old who is bright and energetic. She is in the second grade and she is an above average student. She loves to read books, ride her bike, complete crossword puzzles, and play  with her dolls. Natalyia has been in foster care since November 2001. The average length of time a child spends in foster care is over 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most foster children entered into State custody because their parents were either unable or unwilling to care for them. Not only are children separated from parents, but in many cases, siblings are separated when they are placed in foster care. Terron and Montrell are two brothers in the Louisiana foster care system who would like to be adopted together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Terron is a handsome, happy 8-year-old in the third grade who is placed in the same foster home with his younger brother, Montrell. Both boys would like to be adopted together, because they share a close bond. Terron responds positively to structure, love, and consistency. He is a caring child who has enjoyed living in a two-parent family. He enjoys soccer, baseball, fishing and any outdoor activity. He wants his new family to know that he likes to eat spaghetti, macaroni, and rice-a-roni. Terron  would benefit from a two-parent family that can provide structure as well as stimulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Montrell is Terron's brother. He is a very sweet, friendly, and open young boy who responds well to structure and consistency. He is very bonded to his older brother and with time and nurturance can adjust to a new environment. Montrell is a first grader. School is a challenge for him but with patience and redirection, he responds well. Montrell's overall health is good and he is basically a happy little boy. He enjoys riding his bicycle and playing outside. Montrell and Terron would benefit from a 2-parent family that can provide structure as well as stimulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over half the children in foster care are 10 years of age or older and have more difficulty being adopted. These children are just waiting to flourish with the right parent's guidance. Kody and Ronnie are two brothers who are above the age of 10 years old and are waiting in the Louisiana foster care system for a "forever family."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kody is a cute, very active and outgoing, blonde haired, hazel eyed, 13-year-old boy. He enjoys football, skateboarding, fourwheeling, and playing video games. He also loves horses. He is a sixth grader who enjoys science and reading. Kody would like to be an entertainer when he grows up, such as an actor, a comedian, or a rapper. He would like to be in the same home as his brother, Ronnie.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ronnie is Kody's brother. He is an 11-year-old boy who resembles his brother. Ronnie loves both playing and watching football. He likes to play video games and board games, horses, and going fishing. He is a fourth grader who likes math and science. He would like to be a policeman when he grows up, so that he could rescue people. He would also like to own a toy company, so that he could invent new video games. He wants a family who would care about him. He is very close to his brother Kody and  wishes to remain in contact with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could stand here every day for the next month and talk about each child who needs to be adopted out of foster care. The bottom line is that each of these children, from one day old to 22 years old, needs permanency. They all need a loving, nurturing family that will help them to grow, bring out their unique personalities, and transform them into confident and happy adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On National Adoption Day, I have faith that this can be done and we must continue to be the catalyst. The miracle of adoption cannot be explained, but the loving parents that are holding their children for the first time today are living examples of how dreams can be realized. As an adoptive mother myself, I find that words cannot adequately explain the miracle of adoption. I can only take a moment to offer my most humble thanks, gratitude, and appreciation to all those across the Nation who  have given their Saturday to help find waiting children safe and loving homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us continue to remember that when National Adoption Month and Day end there are still thousands of children like Natalyia, Montrell, Terron, Kody, and Ronnie who need that sense of permanency. I challenge Congress to make these children their first priority and to help them to finally realize that dream. Please support our resolution.</paragraph>
