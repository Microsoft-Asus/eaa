  <speaking speaker="400064" topic="STAFF SERGEANT JAY EDWARD MARTIN">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on May 16, 2007, I attended SSG Jay Edward Martin's funeral. A soldier born and raised in Baltimore, MD, Sergeant Martin lost his life in service to our country. He was 29 years old. I rise today to pay tribute to his life and his sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Martin and two others were killed Sunday, April 29, when an improvised explosive device detonated near their vehicle during combat operations in Baghdad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Martin was not new to the military. After joining the Army in November 1997, he served for nearly 2 years in Germany and Bosnia. He was then stationed at Fort Irwin in California as an Army recruiter. But as a recruiter, Sergeant Martin grew restless and chose to go to Baghdad. A childhood friend remembers Jay's explanation: "I'm supposed to be fighting for my country; I can't sit in an office." An experienced soldier, Sergeant Martin knew the risks and challenges he would face, and  this knowledge makes his decision to serve all the more admirable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Martin had been scheduled for a 2-week break from Iraq in April. But in a selfless move--one that Jay's family describes as typical of his generous spirit--he allowed a fellow soldier whose wife just had a baby to take his place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jay is remembered by those who knew him for his determination, bravery, and devotion to service. Jay displayed remarkable leadership, focus, and determination even as he suffered setbacks in his young life. Jay's mother died when he was only 8 years old, but Jay remained focused on his dream of becoming a pilot and joining the military. An aunt, Lori Martin-Graham, recalls that he would talk about military service for hours with her husband, who had served in the Navy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Martin spoke fervently about the importance of college and attended Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, FL. He  left after a year when he realized his poor vision would prevent him from becoming a pilot. Jay moved forward and joined the Army. "Jay was always ..... positive, ambitious," remembered a friend. "He was always your good conscience."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As one of Sergeant Martin's sisters, Lark Adams, put it, "He was just a shining star. He followed the rules. He did what he was supposed to. He was an example to everyone."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After his death, Jay's fianc&#xE9; Maria Padilla, explained that he would have wanted to see those close to him "laughing because he left us doing what he loved. He left us being the soldier he was so proud of being."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope his family and all who loved Jay will find comfort in that image of the proud and selfless soldier who won several awards including the Army Commendation Medal and the Army Good Conduct Medal. But I also hope they find joy in their memories of the young man who devised hide-and-seek strategy with his friends, who was a swim and track star at Forest Park High School, who took such great pride in his Dodge Stratus RT, who played video games in his grandmother's kitchen, and who debated the  future of the F-14 with his uncle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My thoughts and prayers go out to Jay's father Dwight Martin and stepmother Penny Martin; his grandfather Harry Martin; his four sisters, Lark, Dove, Raven and Shannon; his fianc&#xE9; Maria, and all the other relatives and friends who are bereaved. We honor him as a hero and together mourn his loss.</paragraph>
