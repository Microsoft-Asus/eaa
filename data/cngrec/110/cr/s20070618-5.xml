    <paragraph>Today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 3:30 p.m. The time will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees. Once morning business has closed, the Senate will resume consideration of the energy legislation. There are no rollcall votes today. There are a number of amendments pending. The managers are going to work on trying to dispose of some of those, and maybe there will be other amendments that will be offered today and debated  today.</paragraph>
