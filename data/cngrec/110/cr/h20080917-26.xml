  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Children in foster care are sometimes called our forgotten children. We are here to banish that thought forever. We are here to provide children in foster care the same things that all children need, family, support and an equal chance to succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that goal in mind, the House unanimously passed legislation in June to improve the Nation's child welfare system. The bill we are considering today is a modified version of that legislation, and it reflects an agreement with Senators BAUCUS, GRASSLEY and ROCKEFELLER, who have been working on similar legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This agreement maintains all the critical provisions in the House-passed bill, such as helping grandparents and other relatives who want to permanently care for children in foster care and extending assistance to thousands of children who now age out of foster care every year on their 18th birthday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the legislation now includes a provision that will begin to make sure that all special needs children are eligible for adoption assistance, not just those who come from a family that is eligible for a welfare program that no longer exists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When a child is removed from his or her home because of abuse or neglect, government, on behalf of society, becomes legally responsible for that child. All of us, therefore, act as parents to children in foster care. But for too many foster care children, we fail to fully live up to our parental responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We fail to provide them with permanent homes. We fail to meet their health and education needs, and we fail to help them find their way in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps the most obvious example of our failure is when foster children are literally pushed out into the streets when they are 18 years old. No parent I know abandons their children at age 18, and yet that is what our Federal policy for foster care does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It says to kids to have been abused or neglected, who have been removed from their homes, or who have been placed many times in multiple foster homes that we expect more of them than we would expect of anyone else, including our own children. We displace them from their homes and from any meaningful financial support, and tell them, make it on your own, you are on your own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another example is our failure and the inconsistent effort to help foster children stay connected to their families. We have a system that tells grandparents that they will be denied any assistance if they become legal guardians for a foster child. This is contrary to the growing base of research illustrating that children do better living with relative guardians than they do living in traditional foster care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, siblings are too often split apart at the time of placement. Just when a foster child most needs their brother or sister, they are sometimes separated from them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ensuring school stability is yet another area where we too often come up short. Not enough is done to ensure children can stay in their current schools when they are placed in foster care. We rob them of the one place where they may actually feel secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also hear too many stories about foster children not receiving adequate health services, especially for mental health. Furthermore, we have a special duty to ensure the prescription medications foster children are receiving are effective and appropriate, instead of quick and easy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, we don't provide adequate assistance for Native American children who are removed from their homes and then cared for in the tribal communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act would provide new supports and protections to address many of the concerns I just outlined. The legislation would allow States to extend foster care up to the age of 21, giving young men and women more time to get an education and become truly self-sufficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recognizing that many grandparents and other relatives want to provide loving, permanent homes for children in foster care, this bill would provide Federal payments to relatives who become legal guardians of children for whom they have cared as foster parents. It also requires improved efforts to keep siblings together when they are removed from their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure would require increased oversight on health care needs of foster children, focusing on the assessment, the treatment of health conditions, continuity of care, and monitoring the use of prescription drugs. There is also renewed attention paid to ensuring educational stability for children in foster care, including avoiding frequent school changes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, this bill gives tribes equal and fair access to Federal resources dedicated to keeping vulnerable children safe. For the first time, a tribal child welfare program would directly receive Federal foster care funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation would also provide new resources to ensure all child welfare workers have equal access to training, which ultimately results in better care for children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill extends and improves incentives for States that increase the number of children adopted out of the foster care system. To ensure that we are  adequately helping all families adopting special needs children out of the foster care system, the bill will phase out a requirement that an adopted child's birth parents be eligible for welfare under outdated rules from a program that no longer exists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation includes two provisions that save money and thereby ensures that the bill is completely budget neutral. The first provision would clarify the uniform definition of a child for tax purposes to ensure that the earned income tax credit and other tax benefits are being provided to the families for which the benefits were intended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second provision would allow the Treasury Department to improve its management of the government's short-term operating cash. This language, which has been recommended by the GAO and proposed by the administration, would permit investment of cash in a broader number of institutions, thereby reducing the current concentration of risk and increasing the rate of return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank, again, my ranking member, JERRY WELLER, who is going to leave us. He has been a real partner in striving to work for and improve the lives of children in the foster care system. His efforts will be missed when he leaves Congress at the end of this session, but enacting this bill will surely send him out on a high note.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I yield to Mr. Weller, I would like to talk about another Member of Congress who is not with us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The passing of Stephanie Tubbs Jones was a great shock to all of us who worked with her. We were always impressed by her tireless energy and her infectious smile.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stephanie was a true champion for vulnerable families and children. In fact, her first legislative achievement in Congress was a bill designed to improve training opportunities for caseworkers in the child welfare system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In recognition of Representative Tubbs Jones' efforts to help vulnerable kids, this bill names the primary source of Federal funding for the Social Security Act for Child Protective Services after her, as well as making several improvements to the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services Program will help at-risk children for many years and decades to come, just as she did during her life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, this bill does not address every challenge confronting children in the welfare system, but will take a major step toward correcting many of the system's shortcomings. I only wish Jerry was going to be here to work with me while we put a bigger bill through next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is bipartisan, budget neutral, and good for kids; therefore, it deserves the support of every Member of the House, as it did when it passed unanimously some months ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400429" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of <bill type="h" number="6893">H.R. 6893</bill>, the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act, legislation I am proud to cosponsor with my chairman, Mr. McDermott.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan, bicameral House-Senate agreement extends the Adoptions Incentives program, which has earned due praise for increasing adoptions from the Nation's foster care system. It improves the program by raising financial incentives for adopting older children who are the hardest to adopt, among other changes. That program expires in 2 weeks, so passage of this legislation is both necessary and timely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this bill does much, much more. It expands the eligibility of special needs children for Federal adoption assistance, promoting the adoption of thousands more children out of the foster care system in the coming years. Along the way, it places a priority on older children, children in foster care the longest, and sibling groups who are the hardest to find adoptive families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also promotes stronger family ties in caring for children removed from their own parents due to abuse and neglect, and expects States to do more to locate adult relatives like grandparents or aunts and uncles who can step in to care for such children. And by permitting child welfare agencies access to information from the child support program, the bill helps provide tools to help with that process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It allows States to provide Federal payments to help those adults care for children. And it helps those adults obtain other assistance to ensure kids in their care can thrive. Instead of busting the budget, these pro-family changes actually save money by cutting expensive foster care administrative costs, while most importantly, improving the outcomes for kids in need of a loving home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also responds to concerns that too many youth today are "emancipated" from foster care at age 18 and end up on the streets, in jail, or worse. It offers more help for these older foster youth, providing for their care through age 21 as a State option. But like any responsible parent would expect, it requires able-bodied young people over age 18 to work, stay in school, or participate in training to receive the additional help. Like successful welfare reform policies of the 1990s, it  conditions assistance on youths engaging in positive behavior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The same goes for foster and adoptive youth under age 18. For the first time, they would have to stay in school for their foster parents to receive Federal financial assistance. That may be tough love, but it is far more loving than subsidizing high school dropouts as taxpayers often do today for a shocking share of young people in foster care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored that this legislation includes two provisions I have worked for years to pass and which will benefit children in foster care. First, it ensures equal access to foster care assistance for Native American children, allowing tribes to operate programs just like the States do today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, it provides that all child welfare workers, whether employed by public or not-for-profit agencies, have access to the same resources for training so they can provide the best service to families and most of all children in foster care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this legislation is good for children and for families. It is good for communities, and it is good for taxpayers. It is fully paid for, including by reducing unnecessary foster care administrative costs and by incorporating antifraud reforms proposed by the administration, amongst other savings. It is bipartisan, and includes the best of legislation developed by the House and Senate to better protect and support children. I urge all Members to support this excellent piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as this is the final major legislative activity in the subcommittee on which I serve as ranking member, I would like to thank the hardworking staff who have made this legislation possible. On the Ways and Means Committee Republican staff, I would especially like to thank Matt Weidinger, Margo Smith, and Brian Newell, who have helped me as ranking member of the Income Security Subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last, but not least, I would also like to thank Jack Dusik, who has handled much of my Ways and Means Committee activities for over 5 years. Jack has been a tireless servant of the American people and a great asset to me in representing the 11th Congressional District, and I wish him well as he moves onward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Madam Speaker, I would like to extend my gratitude to my friend, Chairman McDermott, for his friendship over my years in Congress. It has been a real pleasure working with him as a strong partner in fighting for America's disadvantaged youth on the Income Security and Family Support Subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge bipartisan support for this important bipartisan legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I point out that this subcommittee stands as proxy parents for half a million children in this country who spend time in foster care each year. So I would like to thank Grandpa McDermott and Grandpa Weller on behalf of these 500,000 children whose lives are being improved, and Grandma Tauscher, for  helping see that these children's lives are improved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was lucky enough to have Cherita Jones, a former foster youth, as an intern in my office earlier this year. Cherita worked hard and was lucky to live with a caring foster family. She is now out working as an advocate for foster children. I am proud that we are taking this step here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does, in fact, continue foster children's care beyond age 18, and it further allows relatives, grandparents, to participate in supporting the foster children and allows them in many cases to live in loving homes rather than group homes and less permanent settings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we can continue to work together to improve their lives, and I look forward to working with Chairman McDermott to protect the Social Security benefits of foster children and make sure that these resources are used for the benefit of these children and not as a funding source for general revenue to many States. I urge the adoption of the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today is a good day for the more than 4 1/2  million grandparents in this Nation who are raising over 6 million children. Today is a good day for the 80,000 grandparents in Illinois who are raising their young grandchildren, and the 36,500 who are living with kinship caregivers. These families have told Members of Congress for years that they needed more support and that the system wasn't working for many children, and especially for African American kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we can tell them that we heard you and we are doing something about it. I commend Chairman McDermott, Ranking Member Weller, as well as Senators Clinton, Snowe, Grassley, Baucus and Rockefeller for their commitment to reforming foster care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong, unwavering, and resolute support for <bill type="h" number="6893">H.R. 6893</bill>. This compromise between the House and Senate advances child welfare in many areas. In particular, it recognizes that guardianship is an important path to permanency for tens of thousands of children in foster care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In August 2007, the GAO confirmed something that my congressional district and the foster care community has known for years--that African American children are overrepresented in the foster care system, and that subsidized guardianship is a key Federal policy that can help thousands of children into permanent, loving homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Chairman McDermott and Ranking Member Weller for including many of the provisions supporting kinship caregivers that I have championed for years. Specifically, the bill includes four core elements of my bill, <bill type="h" number="2188">H.R. 2188</bill>, the Kinship Caregiver Support Act, which I introduced with Representative Tim Johnson and which Senators Clinton and Snowe championed in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It allows States to use Federal funds to support family caregivers raising relatives in the foster care systems.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield the gentleman an additional minute.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>It provides funding to establish kinship navigator programs; it requires notification of relatives when a child enters foster care; it extends eligibility for independent living services and education training vouchers for youth who exit foster care after age 16; and it allows States to waive nonsafety-related elements of the licensing requirements that may not apply to families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I am very happy that the bill ensures that families that currently receive subsidized guardianship under the current Federal waiver program will be eligible under the new program. This provision protects over 6,000 children in Illinois, as well as the thousands of children in other States who benefit from the waiver program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So again, Madam Speaker, I want to commend Chairman McDermott and Ranking Member Weller, and I also want to congratulate my colleague, Mr. Weller, as he prepares to leave Congress after a stellar career, and I thank Chairman McDermott for acknowledging the work of Stephanie Tubbs Jones. This is an excellent bill, and I urge its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I think what we need to be doing here today is continuing to alert the American people to what is not happening in terms of dealing with the energy situation in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night, House Democrats rejected any efforts on behalf of the Republicans to pass bipartisan energy legislation. They rejected our efforts to do that and they rammed through a sham, hoax, illusory, no-energy bill that falls way short of the all-of-the-above solution that the American people are demanding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill passed by a vote of 236-189, and that should tell the American people how much opposition there was to this no-energy bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even Democrats have indicated that this was the wrong bill. Senator Mary Landrieu has said that the bill is going to be dead on arrival in the Senate. So we know this was simply a vote, as has been publicized in Congressional Quarterly and other publications here in Washington, that was simply a cover for Democrats who are running for reelection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative Gene Green said, "I do not believe our bill goes far enough to address America's energy needs."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even they admit that what was done last night did not respond to the needs of the American people. We are going to continue to discuss this on this floor and even after the Congress adjourns. We also should point out that from the first of August until the end of December, this Democrat-controlled Congress plans to work 14 days. While Americans are facing the highest energy prices they have ever faced in this country, the Democrat-controlled Congress plans to be in session and work for 14 days  in a 5-month period of time. That is shameless. That is unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to be helping the American people by bringing down the price of gasoline. We can do that. Republicans have a bill that will do that. We even would support the bipartisan bill that we introduced last night, but that isn't good enough. All they want is a cover for their Members to go back home and say we voted to drill for more energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>That's not true. By not revenue sharing, they're stealing money from the States who would opt in to do this.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>As the chairman and I have both stated, this is bipartisan, bicameral legislation, broadly supported. I would note I have a number of letters of support. I would like to insert into the Record at this point, Madam Speaker, a letter from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a letter from the Conference of Chief Justices, the Conference of State Court Administrators, as well as a letter signed by 581 national, State and local organizations from every State in the Union in support  of this bipartisan, bicameral legislation designed to help kids, particularly those who need adoption.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>DEAR MAJORITY LEADER REID, SPEAKER PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER MCCONNELL, AND REPUBLICAN LEADER BOEHNER: We are writing to urge you to take necessary steps to ensure passage this month of important improvements in supports for children and  youth in foster care, including new opportunities for permanent families through adoption and relative guardianship and other assistance for older youth transitioning from foster care. The House unanimously passed  the Fostering Connections to Success Act in June and the Senate Finance Committee approved a similar bill last week. Today, the relevant committees announced agreement on <bill type="h" number="6893">H.R. 6893</bill> that reconciles the House and Senate bills. As 581 national and state and local organizations</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Act has bipartisan support and is fully paid for. Its important improvements will help hundreds of thousands of children and youth in foster care by:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Extending and increasing incentives for adoption, particularly incentives for the adoption of children with special needs and older youth in foster care and making many more children with special needs eligible for federal adoption assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Allowing states to offer, for the first time with federal assistance, guardianship payments for children who are in foster care but who have grandparents or other relative guardians who want to care for them permanently outside of foster care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Making it easier for immediate relatives to step in to raise children when their parents cannot by requiring notification of relatives when children are removed from their parents and grants to link caregivers with the services their children need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Offering important protections and supports for American Indian children in foster care, by allowing tribes, for the first time, the same direct access to federal foster care, adoption assistance and relative guardianship funding that states have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increasing opportunities for success for older youth in foster care as they transition into adult life by allowing them to receive federal foster care payments beyond the age of 18.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Improving educational opportunities for children and youth in foster care, which will also increase their opportunities for later success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Promoting the health care of children and youth in foster care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Expanding training opportunities for relative guardians, staff in private agencies and the courts, and attorneys and others representing children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These reforms encompass many of the critical improvements that former foster youth, adoptive parents, relative caregivers, and others have been requesting of Congress for years. We commend you for your leadership and commitment to addressing the needs of our nation's most vulnerable children and youth. The organizations below support timely enactment of these important improvements for children and youth in foster care.</paragraph>

As  you know, the House passed the Fostering Connections to Success Act (<bill type="h" number="6307">HR 6307</bill>) in June and the Senate provisions are moving toward final passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both <bill type="h" number="6307">HR 6307</bill> and the Senate provisions have bipartisan support and are fully paid for. Both proposals also include the following important improvements that will help hundreds of thousands of children in foster care by:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Extending and increasing incentives for adoption, particularly incentives for the adoption of children with special needs and older youth in foster care;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Allowing states to offer for the first time federal assistance for guardianship payments for children who are in foster care, but who have grandparents or other relative guardians who want to care for them permanently outside of foster care;</paragraph>

    <paragraph>STATE LEGISLATURES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Re <bill type="h" number="6893">H.R. 6893</bill></paragraph>
    <paragraph>September 15, 2008</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Boehner: The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) supports the bicameral, bipartisan Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008, <bill type="h" number="6893">HR 6893</bill>. State legislators know the importance of finding permanency for children in the child welfare system, whether through adoption or relative guardianship, and the need to help youth preparing to transition from foster care in their states and communities. We appreciate that  Congress is taking action on these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This important legislation extends and increases incentives for adoption, particularly incentives for the adoption of children with special needs and older youth in foster care. State legislators have long supported the concept that grandparents, or other immediate family members, who are caring for children who cannot safely remain with their parents as foster parents, should be given priority for such custody and placement over placement in a foster home with a non-relative. Additionally, subsidized  guardianship with relatives may be an appropriate permanency option for children who cannot safely return home. Many states have moved forward on their own, so we applaud the fact that this bill makes federal funds available for this option and for support services for caretaker relatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the legislation increases resources available to children aging out of foster care to help them successfully transition into adult life. NCSL's Child Welfare policy has long called for expansion of federal financial participation for states that choose to provide assistance to youth age 18-21 who are preparing to transition from foster care to self-sufficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These improvements encompass many of the critical changes to federal adoption and child welfare policy that state legislators have called upon Congress to enact. Reauthorization of the adoption incentives program will provide critical resources and reward state efforts to find permanence for children in the child welfare system. We commend the House and Senate for its leadership and commitment to addressing the needs of our nation's most vulnerable children and youth. Thank you for moving this  legislation forward so that Congress can complete work on a child welfare measure this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Washington Chair, NCSL Human Services </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I also note that of the 581 national, State and local organizations, and of course they represent every State of the Union that are in support of this important legislation, that a number of them are from the State that I represent, the State of Illinois, including the Baby Fold, which is an organization headquartered in Normal, Illinois in the district that I represent. The Allendale Association, the Child Care Association of Illinois, Children's Home and Aid, Community Action  Partnership of Lake County, Latino Consortium, Methodist Youth Services Northwestern University Settlement Association, Project IRENE, SOS Children's Village of Illinois, UCAN, Voices for Illinois Children, and the Youth Outreach Services are examples of organizations in the State that I represent, which demonstrate broad support for this bipartisan, bicameral legislation designed to help children who need help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I particularly want to point out that, as we worked to develop this legislation, it's very clear, as I had the privilege of working with my chairman, Mr. McDermott, as well as Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley in the Senate, that we shared a common commitment, and that is that we wanted to put together a package legislation that not only deserved bipartisan support but that responded to the needs, particularly of children in foster care, children that need  help and need the opportunity to find a loving family. I found that by all of us working together in a bipartisan way, we produced this bipartisan, bicameral legislation which is now before us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the vote of the House today and the action of the Senate later, this legislation is going to become law. I really want to commend Chairman Baucus and Chairman McDermott for their leadership, as well as Ranking Member Grassley, for the leadership of everyone involved, because the commitment we had from day one was producing legislation that would receive a majority of support in the House and Senate and become law, because we truly want to help children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the bottom line is pretty simple, and that is, I urge my colleagues in the House to join us with strong bipartisan support and send this legislation to the President; legislation that provides incentives to encourage families to adopt children in need of a loving home; legislation designed to ensure that child care workers receive the resources they need so they're fully trained to help children in our foster care system, whether they work for a not-for-profit organization or for a government  agency; and also legislation to ensure that the first Americans receive the same opportunity to access Federal funds for foster care as those of us who came later, and so that the provision which allows tribes to receive these funds, rather than having to go begging to the States, becomes law with this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is good legislation. It's bipartisan legislation. This legislation was put together with the right spirit. I do want to thank my chairman again for the partnership we've had on this legislation as well as many other initiatives. It's nice to show that when we all work together in a bipartisan way, we can get things done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly this legislation, I think, is a great example of what happens when you set aside partisan politics and work together for the good of our Nation, particularly in this case children who are in need of a loving home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I think we are having a discussion today about the tale of two bills, actually. The bill that we have before us here today is really landmark legislation, and as Mr. Weller has said, it is the product of bipartisanship here in the House and actually, bicameral.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I talked to Senator Grassley; we talked about various aspects of the bill so that there was open communication on this issue. And what we've produced from that is landmark legislation that is a significant step forward for children, for foster children, probably the biggest step in more than 10 years. And I think when the Congress works together for the common good, things get done in a very positive way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Children are America's future, and today we're making an investment in that future, and in our own. We all want our children to be connected to their family, and this bill expects the same for foster children. We want our children to feel like they are in a loving, permanent home, and this legislation expects no less for foster kids. We want our kids to go to a school and have decent medical care, and again, we've done that in this bill, or we've begun the process. Finally, we want our children  to have the best chance to succeed in life, a desire that did not end on their 18th birthday. This bill shares in that hope for kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill says to foster kids, you're not forgotten. There is a future and the future begins today. I want to encourage all my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairmen get the unique opportunity of kind of borrowing a lot of ideas from other people. I took some from Danny Davis and some from Stephanie Tubbs Jones and some from Mr. Weller, and we put a bill together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even chairmen shouldn't get all the credit, because staff people like Nick Gwynn and Sonya Nesbit and Sean Hughes on our side have played a major part in talking our way through this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In contrast, we have the energy bill which was brought out here and we continue to hear people talk about as though there was no hope of working with the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now if the Republicans in the Senate would like to work with the Democrats, I think we can put a bill together. We did it on child welfare. Certainly we ought to be able to do it on something as important as energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But to write off legislation and say, oh, the only bill that could pass out of here is the only one that could pass through the Senate, that's simply not respecting the legislative process. The Republicans in the Senate really have to make a choice. They either support American taxpayers and consumers and talk about new energy jobs, or they do what the big oil companies want. That's a very simple choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that it's unfortunate if we in this House give up and say, well, the Senate won't come to their senses; they won't do anything reasonable on energy. They did reasonable things on child welfare because they cared about this country's kids. I think, in the Senate, they care about this country's welfare, and they're going to do something reasonable on energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So all this talk about only the House can produce a perfect bill to be rubber-stamped by the Senate, it didn't work in child welfare. They had to make their changes. We will see some  changes in that Senate bill, if they're thinking about the common good, and not about election on the 4th of November. If it's all about elections, we won't get a bill on energy out of the Senate. But if there is a desire to deal with the common good for this country, then  we will look at the comprehensive bill that was put together over here. And actually some Republicans voted for it. Now that shows it can be bipartisan, even in the House, on a very contentious issue. I think that the fact that it's over in the Senate bodes well. We have a whole week yet for them to come to their senses and send us a bill back.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="6893">H.R. 6893</bill>, the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provisions of this bill will increase the tools available to states to help children in foster care have stable placements and easier transitions into adult life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation allows states to continue foster care assistance for kids up the age of 21, authorizes federal assistance to relatives assuming legal guardianship of children for whom they have cared as foster parents, and extends and improves the Adoption Incentives Program, among other things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While much more remains to be done to ensure the safety and well being of our nation's foster children, I support this legislation as a common sense and much needed first step in the right direction, and I hope that Nevada and other states will take advantage of the new tools made available to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge all of my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="6893">H.R. 6893</bill>, the Fostering Connections to Success Act and Increasing Adoptions Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the Gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott) and the Gentleman from Illinois (Mr. WELLER) for working with our Senate colleagues in crafting this legislation. I am proud to serve on the Ways and Means Income Security and Family Support Subcommittee under their leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, more than half a million children are living in foster care. <bill type="h" number="6893">H.R. 6893</bill> addresses many of the key problems that plague the foster care system. This bill includes much needed educational stability requirements and new oversight for children's health care. <bill type="h" number="6893">H.R. 6893</bill> also includes key adoption incentives that help create permanent, safe, loving families for all children. Of particular importance to my constituents in Georgia are the improvements to kinship guardian care and to services for  youth aging out of foster care included in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation; it is an important step in the right direction. We must pass <bill type="h" number="6893">H.R. 6893</bill> in both the House and Senate before the end of this Congress. Then we must collaborate on more comprehensive improvements to the child welfare system in the 111th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in my home state, there are thousands of young people in foster care. Young people in foster care have not chosen this life. For a variety of reasons beyond their control, foster care children are uprooted from all that they know and rely on us for help. We must answer their call. As Members of Congress, citizens, and as parents, we must open our hearts and offer our hands and resources to serve these young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in doing so by supporting <bill type="h" number="6893">H.R. 6893</bill>. We would do no less for our own children.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6893">H.R. 6893</bill>, The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act, introduced by my distinguished colleague, Representative McDERMOTT. This important legislation encourage a safe and successful adoptions which will strengthen our social system and provide quality foster homes for orphaned children across the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Investing in children is not a national luxury or a national choice. It's a national necessity. If the foundation of your house is crumbling, you don't say you can't afford to fix it while you're building astronomically expensive fences to protect it from outside enemies. The issue is not are we going to pay--it's are we going to pay now, up front, or are we going to pay a whole lot more later on." Marian Wright Edelman</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fundamental purpose of adoption is to serve the best interests of children. It does so by providing loving, responsible, and legally permanent parents when their biological parents cannot or will not parent them. Serving the best interests of children should be paramount in deciding all issues of adoption policy and practice. Adoption is healthy, satisfying, and good for children, not an enduring challenge to identity and wholeness. People who are adopted as infants grow up as healthy and  productive as people raised in their biological families. The vast majority of foster children make the transition into their adoptive families and grow up very successfully.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1990s, there are approximately 120,000 adoptions of children each year. This number has remained fairly constant in the 1990s, and is still relatively proportionate to population size in the U.S. Adopted children do as well as or better than their non-adopted counterparts, according to a 1994 study by the Search Institute, a Minneapolis-based public policy research organization providing leadership, knowledge and resources to promote healthy children, youth and communities. As these statistics  show adoption is a vital part of our society. The large number of families that took children into their homes and hearts do a great service for the children of our nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will improve the compensation for foster parents and increase the amount of federal assistance they receive. These assistance stipulations include:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Federal reimbursement to States choosing to provide assistance to grandparents and other relatives who become legal foster parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Federal assistance for foster children up to the age of 21.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Improved health care for every foster child, including a plan for educational stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Federal Funding for training to cover private child welfare workers and court personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An improved Adoption Incentives Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are currently 510,000 children in foster care, and 129,000 children are waiting to be adopted. 61 percent of these children waiting to be adopted are of a minority background. Within the Children's Services Division, 71 percent of the adoptions are of Caucasian children. This bill will ensure that parents and children involved with adoption will have ample resources available if needed. In turn, this will encourage domestic adoptions that will help every ethnicity of orphaned children throughout  the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I firmly believe that we must pass this legislation in order to support adoption in our country. Adoption benefits this entire country; as domestic children are provided with nourishing homes, that will enable them a more positive environment. This bill will allow foster parents and foster children the compensation and care that they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By passing this legislation, we will provide the necessary means for more adoptions to take place in this country where we are built on strong families and strong people. We must do what we can to assist those whose hearts are kind and ambitions are sincere. I urge my colleagues to support this; I know together we can provide the necessary support for the families and adopted children of the United States. Thank you, Madam Speaker, I yield the remainder of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400405" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for adoption. Specifically, I rise to express my support for two bills we are considering on the floor today--the Fostering Connections to Success and Increased Adoptions Act, and the resolution Recognizing National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no secret that I am pro-life. Life begins at conception, and I believe that we should do everything within our power to encourage and facilitate mothers to carry their child to term. It is my hope and prayer that every child will be wanted and loved by his or her parent. But I am not so nai 4ve as to think that this is always the case. Tragically, there are situations where the mother and/or father cannot care for their baby. Perhaps the mother is still in school, and too young to responsibly  raise the child. Perhaps she is unmarried, and does not have the means to provide for her baby. There are a myriad of reasons. But while there are some in this great nation who would suggest these, and other extenuating circumstances are exactly why abortion needs to remain legal, I instead believe that they are exactly the reason adoption needs greater national attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years that I have had the privilege of serving the people of the 4th District of Kansas here in Washington, I have worked with many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass legislation that protects the sanctity of life, for those born, and those still in the womb. An important aspect of that effort, however, is caring for the child after it is born. Unfortunately, this is an area that is often overlooked. It is my hope that legislation before us today, <bill type="h" number="6893">H.R. 6893</bill> and H. Res.  1432, will help remedy this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Fostering Connections to Success and Increased Adoptions Act takes great steps to assist both children and adoptive parents. It provides financial assistance for relatives of children in foster care that agree to become permanent guardians. And it includes educational stability as a factor when establishing a child's case plans. Provisions like these help to establish a sense of consistency in the life  of a child that is all too often lacking that.  It also reauthorizes the Adoption Incentives Program, which can make the possibility of adopting more feasible for some families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the choice to adopt a child is not one to be made without great consideration. There are risks and challenges involved with such a decision. We in Congress should show them our support and encouragement for them when they do decide to adopt. One way for us to do that is through <bill type="hr" number="1432">H. Res. 1432</bill>. I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting for these bills, and let's show our support for adoption, and the children and families involved in it.</paragraph>
