  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for weeks the House has debated our strategy in Iraq and continued funding for the war. In the midst of this debate, the Democratic leadership adjourned for a 2-week spring break.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even today, we appear no closer to a solution that will support our mission and our troops and sustain an effective foreign policy. The Democrat leadership of both Chambers has indicated its desire to move their message of defeat. Fortunately, President Bush is standing by his commitment to veto the bill and promote our mission for victory in Iraq, to protect American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al Qaeda has stated Iraq is the central front in the war on terrorism. Osama bin Laden has characterized Iraq as the "third world war." Withdrawing from Iraq will not end the global war on terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have confidence in our military leaders, who should not be micromanaged by Congress. Yesterday, Admiral William Fallon testified effectively that the new reinforcement course in Baghdad is producing positive results. We will face the terrorists overseas or again in the streets of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
