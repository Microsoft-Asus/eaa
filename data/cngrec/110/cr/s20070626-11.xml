    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to visit with everyone present for just a few minutes about <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>, the ethics and lobbying reform bill. We hope to appoint conferees on this important bill today. By doing this today, we would enact this critical legislation that is so important to be done. It is the most significant lobbying ethics reform, I believe, in the history of this country. It makes tremendous reforms--long overdue. It will restore the people's confidence in their elected officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, Americans rightly got sick and tired about story after story of corruption, the culture of corruption some called it, here in Washington led by Jack Abramoff, who is now in prison; Randy Cunningham, who is now in prison; Bob Ney, who is now in prison; Safavian, the head of Government contracting, led away from his office in handcuffs; Scooter Libby--numerous people who worked for various House Members who were involved in corrupt activities, airplane trips to golf in Scotland and places  that are hard to imagine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people responded at the polls last November with a clear message that they wanted a new direction, and we, the Democrats, responded by passing the most sweeping ethics and lobbying reform in a generation. We did it with the help of the minority. I do not say that lightly. But let's see what is in this bill. Let's review it for a bit to find out what this bill does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It prohibits lobbyists and entities that hire lobbyists from giving gifts to lawmakers and their staffs. It prevents corporations and other entities that hire lobbyists from paying for trips for Members or staffs. And it prohibits lobbyists from participating in or paying for any such trips. It requires Senators to pay fair market value prices for charter flights, which put an end to the abuses of corporate travel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many people in this Chamber flew in corporate jets and paid first-class airfare. That did not corrupt any Members of Congress, but it was corrupting. It didn't look right, and therefore it is important it be stopped. And I hope it stopped. We need legislation to make sure it is stopped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also slows the so-called revolving door by extending a ban on lobbying by former Members of Congress and senior staffers, and prevents Senators from even negotiating for a job as a lobbyist until their successor has been elected. This legislation puts an end to pay-to-play schemes, such as the notorious "K Street Project." It provides dramatic improvements to disclosure and lobbying activities by doubling the frequency that lobbyists must file reports on their activities, requiring  disclosure of contributions and bundled contributions, requiring that lobbyists' disclosures be publicly available on the Internet in a searchable form. This is for the first time ever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation requires lobbyists to certify in writing that they have not violated House or Senate gift and travel rules. It ends the practice of corporations hiding their lobbying activities behind bogus coalitions with friendly sounding names, and increases civil and criminal penalties for lobbyists who violate the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill has brought about a revolution in earmark disclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the first time ever, the Senate will identify all earmarks in bills, the Senator who requested it, and the entity or location that receives it. Further, every Senator has certified that he or she has no monetary interest in their earmarks. Let me say that. This disclosure is the first time ever that this information will be disclosed. The Senate could have required the disclosure last year or the year before or the year before that, while the number of earmarks was exploding under a Republican  Congress, but it did not. This year we took the lead and changed the way we do business around here. At the beginning of the year, we sent a message that ethics and lobbying reform was our No. 1 commitment by designating the bill <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>. We worked hard to make this a bipartisan bill. Now we must take the next step by appointing conferees. I look forward to moving the ethics bill forward so we can reassure the American people that Congress is as good and honest as the people it represents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have gone over most everything in this bill. There are other things in it, but this is strong, important information the American people deserve. It is a law that should become a reality as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 182, <bill type="h" number="2316">H.R. 2316</bill>, lobbying disclosure; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>, as passed by the Senate on January 18, 2007, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill be read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses,  and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate with a ratio of 4 to 3, with the above occurring without intervening action or debate.</paragraph>
