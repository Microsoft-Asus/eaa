    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to honor the life of Mr. Herman Coleman. Herman was an outstanding and dedicated public servant whose influence, knowledge and achievements were widely  known and highly regarded. Over the course of more than 30 years, Herman held several important positions within the State of Michigan, on the national level and in the private sector. His efforts have made a broad impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Herman began his career with the Michigan Education Association, where he would ultimately become the Association's first African-American executive director/ chief administrator. Among other achievements, Herman was an integral part of statewide deliberations regarding the desegregation of Michigan's school districts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His successful tenure with the MEA led to his appointment as Assistant to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education. As Assistant Secretary, Herman drafted Executive Order No. 12232, which provided the framework for increased Federal assistance to historically Black colleges and universities. This order remains in effect today. Herman would continue his efforts to improve and reform education policy after leaving the U.S. Department of Education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1985, Herman was appointed by Governor Blanchard as the first African-American chief executive officer of the State of Michigan Insurance Department. After a successful tenure with the department, Herman sought to make his mark in the private sector as vice president of corporate relations for AAA Michigan, where he oversaw AAA's community relations and governmental affairs departments. Herman then moved to the health care arena as a consultant for the Potomac Group Consultants, and, in 1994,  began service as both partner/marketing director and managing partner of the Insured Vehicle Identification Network, IVIN.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Herman Coleman's strong leadership and pioneering efforts throughout his lifetime are evidenced by his many achievements and by the many awards and honors bestowed upon him. His legacy will reverberate for many years. I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in honoring the life of Mr. Herman Coleman and in offering the most sincere condolences to his daughters, Hope and Heather, the rest of his family and to his many colleagues and friends. He will truly be missed.</paragraph>
