    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge Louisiana Tech University for its scientific breakthrough and innovation in the department of nanotechnology. I would like to take a few moments to expand on Louisiana Tech's achievements and wish the facility and student body continued success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nanotechnology is the art of manipulating materials on an atomic and molecular level, and Louisiana Tech University has risen to the top of this scientific threshold. This year a trade magazine, Small Times, ranked LA Tech third in micro and nanotechnology education. Small Times evaluated each college based on various criteria, and Louisiana Tech surfaced as one of  the elite universities. Louisiana Tech also stands as one of the only universities  in the country that offers a nanotechnology degree at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Their diversity within the program, and their excellence in both faculty innovation and curriculum ranks them among the best major scientific universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Louisiana Tech University also ranked tenth in the Nation for commercializing nanotechnology inventions, or the capability to process patents and turn them into profitable ideas. The university alone applied for 24 patent applications in the last year, 20 of which involved micro and nanotechnology, proving Louisiana Tech's dedication as a national contributor to the scientific spectrum. As Louisiana Tech blossoms, many profitable institutions have invested and settled within the university,  such as Avoyelles Renewable Fuels, which is working to discover a way to convert biomass waste into a biofuel through a nanocatalyst.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to take a moment to honor Joshua Michael Brown. At Louisiana Tech University, he became this first person in the entire world to graduate with a nanosystems engineering degree. He will continue at Louisiana Tech University in order to gain his doctorate in micronanotechnology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus, today I congratulate Louisiana Tech for its innovation in the ever-changing fields of science, and I look forward to the continued growth of the school and its students as they shape the future development of micro and nanotechnology.</paragraph>
