    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Sergeant Alex Jimenez and to express my continued support for Alex's family during this most difficult time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 12, 2007, Sergeant Jimenez and Private First Class Byron Fouty, members of the 10th Mountain Division, were ambushed south of Baghdad. There has been no information regarding their whereabouts since that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 27, the United States Army changed Sergeant Jimenez's status from duty status whereabouts unknown to missing or captured. We may not know where Alex is, but he is never far from our thoughts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Family members like Alex's father, Andy, or his wife, Yaderlin, have weathered agonizing uncertainty while demonstrating support for their loved one's service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The community in Lawrence, Massachusetts, has been extremely supportive. A POW ride will take place this weekend in honor of Sergeant Jimenez and in support of his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Jimenez and Fouty families are not alone as we all pray for the safe return of Alex and Byron.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Jimenez put his life in danger for our country. We cannot leave him or any other behind. I support legislation to create a select committee on POW/MIA affairs to help these families learn the whereabouts of their loved ones.</paragraph>
