    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this is day 30. That is 30 days so far our veterans have not had the use of the increased funding for their benefits and health care. That is $18.5 million a day not able to be used. And why? Because the Democratic leadership has decided to not complete this bill and send it to the President who has agreed to sign it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In June, this House passed this appropriation bill with a $6 billion increase in a bipartisan manner. We were proud of our work and grateful to our veterans. On September 6, the Senate completed their bill. This work is done. Our veterans are not pawns in a political game. They are heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America expects us to get the job done. America expects us to provide the best care to our veterans. Please join me in calling upon the Democratic leadership to put our veterans first and send this bill to the President now.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
