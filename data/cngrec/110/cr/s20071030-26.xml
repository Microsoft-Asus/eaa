  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the charitable sector has long been an important partner with government in meeting the needs of the disabled. For more than 85 years, Easter Seals has partnered with individuals, families, businesses, communities, and government to help children and adults with disabilities live, learn, work, and participate in their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, Easter Seals assists more than 1 million people through its nationwide network of community-based organizations. These affiliates provide top-quality, family-focused, and innovative services to meet the specific needs of the particular community it serves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, more than 72,000 children received early intervention and childhood development services through Easter Seals. Over 54,000 adults with disabilities learned the skills and gained the confidence needed to seek meaningful employment because of Easter Seals' job training programs. Almost 35,000 children and adults with disabilities participated in confidence-building activities at Easter Seals' camping and recreation programs. Tens of thousands of children and adults with disabilities  received life-changing medical rehabilitation therapies and case management services from Easter Seals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Easter Seals has long been an effective advocate and important resource on policy issues affecting people with disabilities and their families. Its founder, Edgar "Daddy" Allen, lobbied the Ohio Legislature to fund services for children with disabilities in the 1920s. Today, thousands of Easter Seals volunteers and staff from across the country will continue in "Daddy" Allen's footsteps, meeting with their legislators to discuss the importance of low-income working families being able to  obtain health insurance for their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this month, Easter Seals held its national convention in Washington, DC, and its supporters met with Members of the House and Senate to discuss its worthy mission. It is one of America's most respected and effective charitable organizations, and I join my colleagues in congratulating them on a very successful convention.</paragraph>
