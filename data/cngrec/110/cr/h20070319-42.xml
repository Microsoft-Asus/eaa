  <speaking speaker="400209" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I had the pleasure of meeting with Congressman JOHN CONYERS, chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I shared with him information from myself and other Members of Congress who are requesting a hearing on the case of Border Patrol Agents Ramos and Compean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us in Congress are concerned about the Federal prosecutor in this case and his decision to bring criminal charges against these agents. Agents Ramos and Compean were convicted last spring for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These agents never should have been sent to prison, yet today is their 62nd day behind bars. There are legitimate legal questions about how this prosecution was initiated, and how the U.S. Attorney's Office proceeded in this case. Members of Congress and the American people want to know why the Federal prosecutor is on the wrong side in this case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To prosecute the agents, the U.S. Attorney's Office granted immunity to a known drug smuggler. He is not an American citizen, he is a criminal. Drug enforcement reports have confirmed that the Mexican drug smuggler brought a second load of marijuana, 752 pounds, into the United States after he was granted immunity to testify against our border agents, but this information was kept from the jury and the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am certain that Chairman Conyers will review the information that I and other Members of Congress have brought to his attention concerning the prosecution of these two heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before closing, I ask the President to use his authority and pardon these two Hispanic Americans who were doing their job to protect the American people; and, more importantly, I call on the President to listen to the American people and to the thousands of citizens who have asked for a pardon for these two men.</paragraph>
