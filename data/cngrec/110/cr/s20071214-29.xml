    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to comment on the OPEN Government Act. This bill is only a slightly modified version of <bill type="s" number="849">S. 849</bill>, a bill that passed the Senate on August 3 of this year. At that time, I made a more complete statement regarding the bill--see 153 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD at <bill type="s" number="10987">S10987</bill> to <bill type="s" number="10989">S10989</bill> in the daily edition of the RECORD,, on August 3, 2007--as did Senators Leahy and Cornyn--see the Record at <bill type="s" number="10986">S10986</bill> to <bill type="s" number="10987">S10987</bill> and <bill type="s" number="10989">S10989</bill> to <bill type="s" number="10990">S10990</bill>. Thus  my remarks today need only describe the changes made to the bill and a few other matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One section of the bill that makes important changes to the law and thus deserves comment is section 6. Although this section appeared in <bill type="s" number="849">S. 849</bill>, I did not address the provision in August because final negotiations regarding the language of that section were completed only an hour or so before we began a hotline of the bill. The purpose of section 6 is to force agencies to comply with FOIA's 20-day deadline for responding to a request for information. The original introduced version of <bill type="s" number="849">S. 849</bill>  sought to obtain agency compliance by repealing certain FOIA exemptions in the event that an agency missed the 20-day deadline, an approach that I and others argued would impose penalties that were grossly disproportionate and that would principally punish innocent third parties--see S. Rep. 110-059 at 13-14 and 15-19. The current draft applies what is in my view a much better calibrated sanction, the denial of search fees to agencies that miss the 20-day deadline with no good excuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several features of this new system merit further elaboration. First, the 20-day deadline begins to run only when a FOIA request is received by the appropriate component of the agency, but in any event no later than 10 days after the request is received by a FOIA component of the agency. The reasoning behind this distinction is that requesters should receive the full benefit of the 20-day deadline if they make the effort to precisely address their request to the right FOIA office, and that they  should also be protected by the secondary 10-day deadline if they at least ensure that their request goes to some FOIA component of the agency. So long as a misdirected request is sent to some FOIA component of an agency, it is reasonable to expect that such component will be able to promptly identify that missive as a FOIA request and redirect it to its proper destination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the other hand, if a FOIA request is sent to a part of an agency that is not even a FOIA component, it is difficult to impose particular deadlines for processing the request. For example, if a request is sent to an obscure regional office of an agency, it will probably simply be sent to regional headquarters. Many agencies have a large number of field offices whose staff handle very basic functions and are not trained to handle FOIA requests. Such staff probably will not recognize some requests  as FOIA requests. Implementing a deadline that extended to FOIA requests that are received by such staff would effectively require training a large number of additional agency staff in FOIA, something that Congress has not provided the resources to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, because this bill imposes significant sanctions on an agency for a failure to comply with the 20-day deadline, it is important that the deadline only begin to run when the agency can reasonably be expected to comply with it, and that the law not create opportunities for gamesmanship. If the deadline began to run whenever an agency component receives the request, for example, sophisticated commercial requesters might purposely send their request to an obscure field office in the hope that  by the time the FOIA office receives the request, it will be impossible to meet the deadline, and the requester will thereby be relieved from paying search fees. Given the wide variety of types of FOIA requesters, Congress cannot simply assume that every requester will act in good faith and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 6 of the bill also allows FOIA's 20-day response deadline to be tolled while an agency is awaiting a response to a request for further information from a FOIA requester, but only in two types of circumstances. Current practice allows tolling of the deadline whenever an agency requests further information from the requester. Some FOIA requesters have described to the Judiciary Committee situations in  which some agencies have abused this process.  For example, some agencies, when they are about to miss the 20-day deadline, allegedly have contacted a requester to simply inquire whether the requester still wants the request, or with other frivolous inquiries, all for the purpose of obtaining tolling of the deadline. Such practices should not be permitted. On the other hand, agencies do have a legitimate need for some tolling of the deadline. The language of subclauses (I) and (II)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to the tolling for requests for information relating to fee assessments that is authorized by subclause (II), neither agencies nor requesters would benefit if agencies could not contact requesters and toll the deadline while waiting to hear whether a requester still wanted the request in light of, for example, a substantial upward revision in the search fees that would be assessed in relation to a FOIA request. And because such upward revisions might occur multiple times as a request  is processed, it is not practical to impose a numerical limit on such fee-related requests. Such requests need only be necessary in order to be entitled to tolling under this subclause. Presumably, a request as to whether a requester still wanted his request in light of a trivial upward revision in the search-fees estimate would not be "necessary," and therefore would not be entitled to tolling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to the catch-all requests authorized by subclause (I), representatives of the agencies identified for the committee a wide array of additional reasons for which agencies reasonably need to request additional information from the requester and should be entitled to tolling. The agencies' representatives, however, also thought that an agency would not need to make more than one such non-fee-related information request. Since the agencies are the masters of their own interests, we have  incorporated that limit into this bill, allowing the agencies to make a tolling-initiating request for any purpose and in addition to previous fee-related requests, with the additional stipulation that these one-time requests also be reasonable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additional changes were made to this bill from <bill type="s" number="849">S. 849</bill>. This bill omits section 8 of the August-passed bill. The former section 8 maintained the requirement that previously enacted statutes only be construed to create exemptions to FOIA if the statute at least established criteria for withholding information, but required that future statutes instead include a clear statement that information is not subject to release under FOIA. I only grudgingly accepted former section 8 since I do not favor  the use of clear statement rules in this circumstance. The rule likely would serve as a trap for unwary future legislative drafters. Under such a rule, even a statement in a statute that particular information shall not be released under any circumstances whatsoever would be construed not to preclude release of the information under FOIA. On the other hand, some FOIA requesters came to have second thoughts about section 8's elimination of the requirement for future legislation that FOIA exemptions at least set criteria for what information may be withheld. In my view, it would not be practical to require a clear statement in addition to requiring that exemptions only be implied when release criteria are identified. At the very least, it would pose a difficult question of statutory construction were a court asked to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This draft also includes a provision that is now subsection (b) of section 4 that requires that attorneys' fees assessed against agencies be extracted from the agencies' own appropriated budgets rather than from the U.S. Treasury. This change was necessary in order to avoid an unwaivable point of order against the bill in the House of Representatives under that body's pay-go rules. I do not like this provision. As I explained in my August 3 remarks, I believe that section 4 already awards attorneys'  fees too liberally in the circumstances of a settlement. Effectively, it protects an agency from fee assessments not when the agency's legal position would prevail on the merits, but rather only when the requester's claims would not survive a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. I believe that this standard will discourage agencies from settling--even a case that the agency believes that it will win at trial it likely will be disinclined to settle if the agency believes that the claims would not be dismissed on summary judgment. Subsection (b), by extracting the fees out of the agency's own budget, substantially aggravates section 4's de facto no-good-deed-goes-unpunished</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill includes two changes that were sought by the House. One is to expand section 6's denial of search fees to agencies that miss the response deadline to also include duplication fees in the case of media requesters and other subclause (II) requesters who already are exempted from search fees. Since these requesters already do not pay search fees, in their cases the threat of denying agencies such fees if the 20-day response deadline is not met is not much of a sanction. Although  duplication fees for idiosyncratic requests sometimes are massive and denying such fees in all cases would be excessive--paper and toner do cost money--it is my understanding that media and other subclause (II) requesters typically make narrow and tailored requests that do not result in massive duplication costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The last change made in this bill is the addition of the new section 12, which requires that when an agency deletes information in a document pursuant to a FOIA exemption, that it identify at the place where the deletion is made the particular exemption on which the agency relies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Overall, I believe that the bill that will pass the Senate today strikes the right balance and that it will improve the operation of the Freedom of Information Act, and I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
