    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wanted to make a couple of remarks about the GI bill of rights. We had an opportunity today to vote on a piece of legislation which included that. That legislation is so necessary for our veterans. I know, Mr. President, you in your State, as a former Governor and Senator, know the impact of veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Pennsylvania, we have over a million veterans, and so many of them served our country in war after war. And in this war, the war in Iraq or anywhere in the world where they serve, all they are asking us to do is to help them in a couple of very basic ways: They want our respect, which we should always provide, and I think most Americans do over and over again. But they also should have the right to an education after they have served their country. It is that simple. We all know education  is often referred to as the great equalizer. Sometimes when someone comes from a disadvantaged background, they are able to lift their sights and partake in the American dream because they have an education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If soldiers are serving in combat, men and women in uniform for America, the least we should do is provide them with an education when they come home so they can have the chance at the American dream here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the last thing, certainly not in that order, they have a right to expect is quality health care. We have a long way to go. Despite great work by people who work in the VA, there is a long way to go to provide the kind of quality health care our veterans have a right to expect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when we remember on this floor the words of Abraham Lincoln a long time ago when he talked, about people who served in combat and war, he talked about caring for him who has borne the battle and his widow and his orphan. When we think about that today, caring for him or her who has borne the battle, it must mean at least those three things: our respect, quality health care, and a quality education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why this bill is so important. I am grateful so many of our colleagues agree with that. But we have got a long way to go to make sure the GI bill is the law of the land, not just something to debate but the law of the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the President, I hope people on both sides of the aisle here join us in that, in making sure the GI bill of rights at long last is the law of the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
