    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="76">H. Res. 76</bill>, which would establish a national holiday in honor of C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez dedicated his life to teaching others that persistence, hard work, faith, and willingness to sacrifice oneself breaks down barriers. He committed himself to achieving justice and equality for all farm workers, and paved the way for momentous social change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1962, C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez formed what is known as the United Farm Workers. His efforts initiated one of the greatest social movements of our time. He dedicated himself to fighting for safe working conditions, reasonable wages, decent housing and the outlawing of child labor for farm workers everywhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Ch&amp;#225;vez embraced nonviolent tactics to help focus national attention on the problems that existed for farm workers. Mr. Ch&amp;#225;vez was said to have given his last ounce of strength defending the farm workers before he died in his sleep on April 23, 1993.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez is honored throughout America for his tireless work to help those who could not help themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my hometown of Houston and my district every year we celebrate the life and times of C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez by holding a Hispanic heritage parade and day of celebration. A national holiday in honor of C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez would serve as an inspiration to those who seek to create a better world in the legacy of one who served to remind us that together all things are possible; in Spanish, "si se puede."</paragraph>
