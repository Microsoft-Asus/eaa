    <paragraph>I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the National Guard and in celebration of their 371 years of service. I would like to thank my colleague from Florida, Ginny Brown-Waite, for bringing this measure to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my State of New Hampshire, the first citizen militia formed in 1623 with the settlement of Portsmouth. In 1679, the New Hampshire National Guard was formally established, marking the humble beginnings of my State's storied tradition of service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, nearly 2,700 men and women continue that same tradition of service in the New Hampshire National Guard, and they, too, are distinguishing themselves on the battlefield and at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In New Hampshire, our Guardsmen routinely perform search and rescue operations. They respond to floods and to ice storms that threaten the region each year. And the New Hampshire Guard joined many other States that answered the call to aid victims from Hurricane Katrina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This story of selfless sacrifice is not unique to the members of New Hampshire's National Guard, but it is one example of how all National Guardsmen put others before self, and their service and sacrifice is honored here in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, over 30,000 Guardsmen are serving on the ground and in the skies over Iraq and Afghanistan. As we celebrate the National Guard for its 371 years of service, our thoughts are with those men and women who continue to serve bravely overseas and with their families back home. And our hearts are heavy remembering the 483 Army and Air Guardsmen that have given their last great measure of devotion. For them we vow to care for their families and honor their sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 542, which expresses the unconditional support of the House of Representatives for the members of the National Guard. I certainly want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, December 13 was the 371st birthday of the National Guard. I could not think of a better way to celebrate this tremendous milestone than to honor the men and women who serve in the National Guard with the resolution before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Guard certainly serves a unique purpose. Its main duty, of course, is to secure and defend our homeland. However, the National Guard also plays a vital role in aiding States when natural disasters strike. Whether it is helping to harness the wildfires that recently raged throughout California, or aiding in the aftermath of hurricanes or tornadoes in Florida and across the Southeast, the National Guard has been there lending a helping hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While helping out in times of need across the United States leaves a lasting impact, it is the work that the National Guard does on beyond our borders that truly sets it apart. When National Guard units are called up, the men and women who answer the call leave their careers, families, and loved ones behind. These men and women put their lives on hold to protect this great country, and for that we must be eternally grateful. In fact, over 329,000 members of the National Guard have been mobilized  in support of numerous military operations since September 11, 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Guard units from my district have played a critical role in many of these operations, and I want to take this opportunity to thank them for everything they do in defense of all of our freedoms. Their contributions have been a tremendous asset, and without the National Guard, the United States Armed Forces would not be able to operate at the high level it currently does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of you know, an issue that is extremely important to me and the people of my district, and most likely your district too, is illegal immigration and the need for greater border security. That's why it is also important to note that the National Guard is playing a vital role in protecting our borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are currently 6,000 National Guardsmen serving along our borders, doing their best to stem the tide of illegal immigration that threatens this country. The National Guard is playing an every-increasing role in the defense of our great country, and I encourage my colleagues to show their support for the sacrifices these men and women make by supporting this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Representative Ginny Brown-Waite for introducing this resolution and my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for bringing it to the floor for our consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a proud co-sponsor, I am honored to have this opportunity to recognize the contributions of our citizen soldiers in the United States National Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the earliest days of our country's founding to today, average Americans have stepped forward to serve their Nation. Soldiers of the National Guard have served in every major combat throughout our great history, and since September the 11th, they have taken a tremendous role in support of the global war on terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since these terrible attacks 6 years ago, 329,982 members of the National Guard have been mobilized for military operations around the world. Unlike their traditional military comrades, National Guard members are not career military soldiers. They are most often employed in other careers and serve when called upon to assist with combat operations and as first responders during domestic emergencies and rescue and recovery situations. This unique role underscores an immense dedication to their  patriotic duty and to this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a 31-year veteran of the Army Reserve and National Guard, I am honored to have known and worked with many of these extraordinary and dedicated individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>My former unit, the 218th Mechanized Infantry Brigade of the South Carolina Army National Guard is currently serving in Afghanistan under the leadership of Brigadier General Bob Livingston. Its 1,800 troops are the largest deployment of National Guard since World War II. I have visited the troops in June, August and November, and I know firsthand they are training Afghani police and military forces to help that young democracy stand on its own two feet. The best way to stop terrorism is to deny  terrorists safe havens anywhere in the world. Additionally, my son, Alan, was deployed with the South Carolina National Guard to Iraq, along with my son, Julian, with Guard service in Egypt. And my family and I are grateful for their service and the service of their comrades, led by Major General Stan Spears, America's</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this resolution, we recognize the contributions of the Guard, but we also pledge to support their efforts with the necessary resources and express our deepest gratitude to the families whose loved ones serve this Nation. Above all, our deepest sympathies go to the families whose loved ones have been lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of my colleagues in the House of Representatives and the American people, I want to thank the brave men and women of the Guard for their service. In times of peace and times of war, there they are working to protect our Nation and our allies around the world and the citizens here at home. I want to thank Representative Ginny Brown-Waite for introducing this resolution. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it and expressing our most humble appreciation for  the citizen soldiers of the National Guard.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="542">H. Res. 542</bill> which expresses the unconditional support of the House of Representatives for our brave men and women who serve as members of the National Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past several years, the National Guard has confirmed their willingness to serve our country, often giving up their civilian careers to be deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan or other parts of our country where their particular expertise is needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Guard has done this all the while fulfilling their traditional duties in times of domestic emergencies, leading recovery efforts in case of flood, fire, hurricane, snowstorm, tornado or civil disturbance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am especially proud of the Army and Air National Guard units from my district, the U.S. Virgin Islands, who are deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan and at other bases and installations across the country. Our entire territory gives its overwhelming support to the 651st GS Maintenance Company in Iraq, D Company 126th Aviation at Ft. Benning, GA, other individual soldiers stationed in Afghanistan, Iowa, Hawaii and Kuwait.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also remember that two of our Guard, LTC David Canegata and Staff Sgt. Floyd Lake, made the ultimate sacrifice earlier this year when their Blackhawk helicopter went down in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, along with my constituents in the territory, I pray for the safe return of all our men and women in the military.</paragraph>
