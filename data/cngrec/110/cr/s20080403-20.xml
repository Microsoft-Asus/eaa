  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to commend the Peace Corps and its volunteers for 47 years of service to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1960, John F. Kennedy challenged students to dedicate a portion of their lives to serving their country overseas in the cause of peace. A year later, as President, he established the Peace Corps. And now, after 47 years, the Peace Corps shines as a beacon of our commitment to the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Created to extend the volunteerism of the American people abroad, the Peace Corps has sent more than 190,000 citizens to nearly 140 countries as grassroots ambassadors of American goodwill. They have made lasting contributions in fields like agriculture, education, health care, and the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty-seven North Dakotans currently serve in the Peace Corps. I know many individuals who volunteered their service. What I have heard of their experiences is truly remarkable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Kennedy challenged us to ask what we can do for our country. The men and women of the Peace Corps rise to that challenge. Through their service, they demonstrate to the world that America and her people truly do care.</paragraph>
