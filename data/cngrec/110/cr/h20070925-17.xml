    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the new majority sadly declares politics more important than health care for our Nation's poorest children. Democrats are moving forward with a massive expansion of Washington-run health care under the auspices of helping kids. Yet, any honest discussion about this bill reveals that it is clearly less about helping children and more about Washington control. You see, they think they can make better decisions than you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Remarkably, this expansion of bureaucratic health care offers taxpayer-funded coverage to people who are neither poor nor children. Democrats have made it clear that this bill is just the next step in their desired march toward Washington control of health care. And as a physician, I have seen how dangerous government control of health care can be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than forcing bureaucratic-controlled health care upon the American people, I urge my colleagues to reject this proposal and reauthorize SCHIP in a way that is consistent with its original bipartisan intent: helping America's poorest children.</paragraph>
