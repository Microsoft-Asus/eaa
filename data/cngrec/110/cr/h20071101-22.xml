    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, over 135 years after President Ulysses S. Grant signed the Mining Law of 1872 into law, I bring before this body legislation to drag it into the 21st century. This legislation at long last provides badly needed fiscal and environmental reforms of mining for valuable minerals in the 11 western States and Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In bringing this measure before the House, I am pleased to have the strong support of our colleague from California (Mr. Costa), who chairs the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources of the Natural Resources Committee. JIM chairs the subcommittee that I chaired 20 years ago when I first began this effort to reform the Mining Law of 1872. I am honored that he has taken up the mantle as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mining Law of 1872 is the last of the frontier-era legislation to remain on the books, with the Homestead Act having long been repealed, not to mention laws regarding carrying your six-gun into a saloon or allowing a posse to hang horse thieves. The basic goal of this law, almost free land and free minerals to help settle the West, has long been achieved. While the minerals produced under this law remain in demand, mining under an archaic 19th century regime is not compatible with modern  land use philosophies or social values. This threatens mining, and mining jobs, and is one reason this law must be brought into the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, as in the 1800s, the Mining Law allows claims to be staked on Federal lands in the West for valuable hardrock minerals such as gold, silver, and copper. No royalty is paid to the true owners of these lands, the American people, from the production of their minerals. Except by dint of an annual appropriations rider, the claims can be sold to multinational mining conglomerates for $2.50 or $5 an acre.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, some listening to what I just said may think I am making this up. Free gold and land for $2.50 an acre? That sounds like a fairy tale. My friends, ladies and gentlemen, I am not making it up. This is no fairy tale. This is a pirate story, with the public lands profiteers robbing the American public blind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, billions of dollars' worth of gold, silver, and copper have been produced from American soil without a royalty paid to the true owners of the land, the American people. Those that will recall history will know that the largest bank heists in the world have been the $900 million stolen from the Central Bank of Iraq in 2003; the $72 million stolen from Knightsbridge Security Deposit in England in 1987; and the $65 million stolen from the Banco Central in Brazil in 2005. But, my colleagues,  those figures are chump change, chump change compared to the estimated $300 billion in valuable minerals given away for free from America's public lands under the Mining Law of 1872. Incredible. Simply incredible. But, it gets worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Being a 19th-century law, it contains no mining and reclamation standards. The result is a legacy of toxic streams, scarred landscapes, and health and safety threats to our citizens from abandoned mined lands. The mayor of Boise, Idaho, and let me restate that State, Idaho, wrote a letter to me recently to state that the city is powerless to protect the integrity of its source of drinking water, which is threatened by a cyanide heap-leach gold mining facility proposed by a Canadian, and I repeat  that, a Canadian-based company.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This last September, a 13-year-old girl tragically plunged to her death in an Arizona mine shaft. In reference to an area pocketed with abandoned mine sites, an Arizona mine inspector was quoted as saying: "It's just a death trap out there."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mining Law of 1872 is the Jurassic Park of all Federal laws. It requires an extreme makeover. Environmental safeguards must be supersized. Federal lands must stop being given away for fast-food hamburger prices. The robbery of America's gold and silver must stop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the bill I am bringing before the House today would make commonsense reforms by imposing a royalty on the production of these hardrock minerals. Bear in mine that coal, oil, and gas produced from Federal lands have long paid these royalties. The legislation would also put a permanent end to what is known as patenting, the sale of mining claims for the price of a snack at Taco Bell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, it would provide for statutory mining and reclamation standards that are performance-based rather than prescriptive. As well, this would establish a special fund to reclaim abandoned hardrock mines, address the health and human safety they propose, and provide for community impact assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a historic debate, a debate that is long overdue. Those who support this legislation, the countless locally elected public officials across the West, concerned citizens across the West, sportsmen and -women across the West, taxpayer advocates across America, bring with them the new-century conviction that corporate interests can no longer have an unfettered ability to reap America's mineral wealth with no payment in return. There must be parameters set and rules to which industry must  comply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am here to suggest that if we continue under the current regime, that if we do not make corrections, the ability of the mining industry to continue to operate on public domain lands in the future is questionable. The other side will bring up jobs, they will bring up the health of the industry that might be decimated by this legislation. I say we are here to protect mining jobs and to protect the health of the industry and to provide some certainty in the making of financial decisions by the  mining industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the Mining Law of 1872 over the years has helped develop the West and cause needed minerals to be extracted from the Earth, we have long passed the time when this 19th-century law can be depended upon to serve the country's 21st-century mineral needs, and do so in a manner accepted by society. Reform of the Mining Law of 1872, I tell my colleagues, is a matter of the public interest, the interest of the American taxpayer, the interest of all Americans who are true owners of these public  lands. The name of every American is on the deed of these lands. I urge approval of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400313" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for his work on this bill and rise in opposition against that bill. There are no Third World countries. There are simply overregulated countries; there are overregulated economies. The debate that Members of this House are about to engage in will be passionate because the positions that we are fighting over are polarizing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it did not have to be this way. We all agree on the same principles, hardrock mining on Federal land should pay a royalty, should continue to operate in the most environmentally responsible manner in the world, and protect the health and financial security of the miners who bring the world's minerals to the surface.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned earlier, if given a fair hearing, we would have agreed on these goals. Instead, right now at this moment the stock market is plunging in this country because of the rising energy prices. Oil hit $94. Our stock market is reacting. The price of our dollar has fallen. We are doing things in this body that will punish domestic jobs and domestic industries. They will not touch the mining industry outside of this country. Outside countries will have better access to our markets because  of the things that are occurring in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, yes, we are passionate about our position, and, no, we do not listen to the arguments, no matter how well-conceived from the other side, because they are simply arguments; they are not truths. We are here to fight against a bill brought forth by the chairman which will send some of the highest paying jobs in the West overseas by making mining in the U.S. uneconomic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members from western States, like mine, will fight fiercely to keep these jobs because the West cannot survive off tourism alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a chart here that shows the relative wages in the mining industry. We have had hearings about the evolving West and what they hope the West looks like, but we in the West want these good, high-paying union jobs that exist now in the mines. The jobs in tourism do not pay nearly as much. That is what we are fighting for today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By making mining in the U.S. uneconomic, the chairman's bill will give competitive advantage to countries like China and India. We Members who like the U.S. being number one and who don't like the current value of the dollar are fighting against that. I favor American exceptionalism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By making mining in the U.S. uneconomic, the chairman's bill will compromise the readiness of our military because the military will have to further import the strategic minerals and materials it needs from hostile nations. It would be a sick twist of fate if the U.S. had to start importing uranium from Iran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to defend the bill against job loss, the economic security and military security, you are going to hear some rhetoric that simply amounts to whoppers, the whoppers about the 1872 mining law on the House floor today, and I think it is important to set the record straight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, you will hear the law was passed in 1872, and at 135 years old it needs modernizing. I wonder where the chairman is when it comes time to modernize Yellowstone National Park, which was also created in that same year. But I will tell you that the chairman would be the first to argue against any changes in the acts that created our national parks, and Yellowstone in particular. Maybe the leaders back then believed that we needed to protect areas, but we also needed to use some of our lands  to supply the materials for a growing Nation, because they understood we needed those materials. Maybe our politicians of today do not care if America's economy grows or not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, you will hear that the law allows public lands to be purchased for $2.50 an acre, the "price of a snack," I think were the words that were used. And yet I do not see any of our people in this Chamber or across the Nation standing up to say let me have some of that land for $2.50 an acre. Because the truth is that you have to mine that land to get it for $2.50 an acre. Maybe it is just not that easy to prove up on the mineral assets, on the mineral claims, as the chairman caused us  to believe here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, you will hear that energy companies pay 12 percent or more in royalties for coal, oil and gas on Federal lands; mineral mining companies don't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, that seems fair, doesn't it? But you have to understand that many of our energy companies also tried to buy mining claims and tried to do mining, and they gave up on it because they simply could not do it. They did not have the economics right. They didn't understand how to do it. And no more than you and I can buy a claim for $2.50 and make a mining claim work, even our biggest oil companies could not do it. And these are the kinds of misinformation points that we are asked to believe today  on the floor of the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I tell you, please, my friends, do not believe it, because we are about to export these jobs, these good high-paying jobs. We are going to export jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, you are going to hear that the Mining Law needs modern environmental laws. The mining industry today is well regulated. The mining industry itself, the BLM, the regulatory agencies used to have mines that looked like this top chart; and this mine under current law, under current environmental regulations, has now looked like this. We had testimony to this in our committee, but the majority just decided that they didn't need to listen to what is going on already. They wanted to create  new overlapping legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and all other Federal regulations apply to the mining industry. But you would believe, if you heard our friends on the other side of the aisle, that we are simply out here digging holes in the ground and we are polluting the streams with no oversight. It is just not true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, my friends, as we engage in this argument, listen to the passion from the West, because you will know that our jobs are at stake, our livelihoods are at stake. There are people who want to make the West simply the vacation ground for the rest of the country. And I am saying from the West, we just want jobs, good jobs. We want not only jobs, but careers for our families. We want careers for our kids. And the legislation today here is designed to take away the careers from the West.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Look at it very carefully, because today the stock market is plunging amid fears of high energy prices and unavailable access, no access to drilling lands to increase the supply; and our dollar is falling because the world believes that we are going to give away our economy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate my friend, the gentleman from West Virginia, on his legislation that substantially reforms the governance of hardrock mining on public lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Abandoned mine sites pose serious environmental and safety hazards. Currently, there are more than 80 hardrock abandoned mines or mine-related sites on the EPA's Superfund National Priorities List. Polluters should pay to clean up the pollution they leave behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to have a colloquy with the gentleman from West Virginia to clarify the use of federally appropriated funds from the Hardrock Reclamation Account under sections 411, 412 and 413 of the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, October 29, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I write with regard to <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>, the "Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007". I know it is your wish for the bill to be considered on the House floor as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the provisions in the bill establish requirements for the Environmental Protection Agency and concern the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. Those provisions are within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I am not, however, raising the issue with the Speaker because it is my understanding that you have agreed that the referral and consideration of the bill do not in any way serve as a jurisdictional precedent as to our  two committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, as to any conference on the bill, the Committee on Energy and Commerce reserves the right to seek the appointment of conferees for consideration of any portions of the bill that are within the Committee's jurisdiction. It is my understanding that you have agreed to support a request by the Committee with respect to serving as conferees on the bill (or similar legislation).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I request that you send to me a letter confirming our agreements and that our exchange of letters be inserted in the Congressional Record as part of the consideration of the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for your recent letter regarding the jurisdictional interest of the Committee on Energy and Commerce over <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>, the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act. As you know, some sections of <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> as reported by the Committee on Natural Resources relate to the application of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), and others establish requirements for the Environmental Protection Agency, both of which fall  under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding that you will not seek a sequential referral of <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> based on the inclusion of these provisions in the bill. Of course, this waiver is not intended to prejudice any future jurisdictional claims over these sections or similar language. Furthermore, I agree to support your request for appointment of conferees from the Committee on Energy and Commerce if a conference is held on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this matter and others between our respective committees. At your request, I will include this exchange of letters in the Congressional Record as part of consideration of the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 9 minutes to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400440" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to what could have been responsible bipartisan legislation. I have a great deal of respect for the chairman of the committee; he is a good friend of mine. But this is a bad bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman on our side, the ranking member, Mr. Pearce, has done an outstanding job, he mentioned in his statement to listen to the chairman of the committee and those who are promoting this bill that the mining industry has no regulations, no laws, they just run rampant, which is pure nonsense. We are not really addressing an 1872 mining law here. It is not about the royalty. They offered the chairman if he would strike title III, we might be able to work a bill, and he turned  it down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is about driving our industry, our mining industry overseas and away from our shores. This bill will do it. Just as I have heard in the past about legislation from that side of the aisle when you were in power that we are not trying to stop the logging industry in Alaska, we are just trying to make sure that we get our fair share. We went from 15,000 jobs down to less than 300 jobs. That was from the previous chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also heard all the time about how when they were in power, how we were going to be energy independent. And now we are paying $93 a barrel for oil, $93 a barrel, because you have not acted and we didn't do also. But we didn't try to stop the mining industry in this country as this bill will do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not just about mining; this is about national security. Where do you think the metals come from to build our airplanes? Right now we are probably importing most of it. And I guarantee you, we will import all of it under this bill. We know, Mr. Rahall, this doesn't affect West Virginia. It doesn't affect his coal mines or any of the east coast States. But it does affect public lands in the West where our minerals are derived from.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say wake up, Mr. and Mrs. America and my colleagues. Wake up. China has gone into Chile now, and they control the copper that we must have for our hybrid cars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, all of you, as I watch my good friend there working his BlackBerry, where do you think the metals and minerals came from for this? As we vote electronically today, the metals and minerals make that electronic system work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are not talking about the royalty, here; although, I do think it is unconstitutional as the bill came out of committee because you rewrote the contract under the bill. It will be taken to court and that part of the bill will be struck. It will be struck. I tried to say that. But no, again this is not a bipartisan bill. This is a bill that was written primarily by the leadership of this House that in reality takes away the ability for the western States to produce the minerals that are needed.  That is what this bill does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It does affect my State probably more than any other bill that has come out other than the Alaskan National Lands Act that put 147 million acres of land off limits. What remaining BLM land we have where we are trying to develop a mining industry will be precluded, taking away the benefit of the mining industry in the State of Alaska as it does in the western States. But it affects my State more, probably.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, we probably could have written a bill that would have recovered the dollars necessary to straighten out hardrock mining. But no, we have a bill that stops the ability of this Nation to be self-sufficient in minerals. Later on you will see a display about just how dependent we have become.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am hoping that this bill will be killed in the Senate, as most bills will be killed from the House side because no one wants to work with the Republicans at all. That is why you have an 11 percent rating of favorability. No ability to work across the aisle and say what will work and what are we trying to achieve. What are we trying to achieve?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you were looking for money from royalties, we could have talked about that; prospective, not retroactive, because that will go to court. But that didn't happen, and you left title III in, which requires so much impossibility of achieving a mining claim that they will go abroad. They will go abroad, and that's not right for this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have said all along, and I am going to be around here a lot longer than most people expect, and most of you probably don't like that, but I will be here just to say "I told you so" like I have done with the logging, what you did in my State and the logging industry and the west coast and on public lands. There is no timber industry. We are now importing our timber with no regulations. We have private timber in the eastern States, but not in the western States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I listen to you. We just voted on a bill yesterday to help out people who are going to be displaced because of losing jobs overseas, and you voted for that. And that is what this bill does. It will drive the industry out of the United States of America and we will be dependent upon China and Russia and all of the other countries for the metals and minerals we must have in our Nation to make sure we are economically strong, and then we cannot become strong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as much as I love you, Mr. Chairman, this is a bad piece of legislation. I have been told don't worry about it, we will take care of it later on down the line. Well, I have been down that road before, too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am asking my colleagues on my side of the aisle and anybody that is thinking on that side of the aisle to vote against this legislation if you believe in this Nation. If you believe in this Nation being strong, if you believe in jobs in our country and not abroad, then you will vote "no" for this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you don't believe that, then vote "yes" for the bill. And then go home and say, "I repealed the 1872 mining law. Look what I did for you, Mr. Backpacker." But think of our country and our Nation. Think of our future. Vote "no" on this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Costa from California.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400618" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for all your hard work on this issue, not just this year, but for the last two decades. I also want to thank the ranking Republican member, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), and the ranking member of our subcommittee, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce), for all of their hard work over the last 10 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is an important piece of legislation and it provides a balanced approach to public lands. It recognizes that hardrock minerals to our lives are important, but they are also important as a public trust that belong to all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this process over the last 10 months, we held numerous hearings at which over 33 witnesses testified. For example, in Pima County, Arizona, earlier this year, we had local government  and citizens talk about the important values, as well as the impacts to water, wildlife and recreational opportunities. We also listened to State and local government and tribes and gave them the option to close sensitive lands which are critical to their communities,  or to have restraint. Lands that provide, in fact, drinking water supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Elko, Nevada, the subcommittee received additional testimony from people to understand how important the mining is to those communities in those towns. Let's make it clear. We do not want to put those mining operations out of business. They provide a viable industry to this Nation which has already been substantiated. We gained a better understanding on the ways that industry strives, and they are doing a marvelous job for the most part in being responsible and following regulations which  they must comply with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many States have already taken initiatives. The committee listened. We have taken amendments which make mineral exploration provisions to benefit an important part of the industry to keep the momentum and the motivation there. We also took changes in title III to set forth strong national standards for mining but make sure that we are not duplicating existing State law and regulations. The subcommittee hearings in Washington also focused on the issue of royalties, which has been much talked about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me address some of those criticisms at this time about it decimating the mining industry. Some of us are old enough to remember Sergeant Friday from Dragnet. Remember what he used to say: "Just the facts, ma'am." Well, the facts are this: These are multinational companies that mine in areas throughout the world, and they pay royalties in those countries. They pay royalties in those countries, and they are existing and doing fine, as they are doing fine in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the total income subject to the proposed royalty, which I would submit is a work in progress, would average roughly $1 billion a year. These are public lands. We require the same for oil and gas production. It is a relatively small number when you take into account that the total U.S. mining industry produces $23 billion each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congressional Budget Office also estimates that the cost of this legislation, should it become law, would approximately be, with this royalty, $200 million over a period of 5 years. That is $200 million over a period of 5 years, a $23 billion a year industry in this country. We think that is a fair shake for these lands that are owned by all Americans, and it makes a serious opportunity to resolve something that has been contentious for two decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The industry will tell you that they want certainty. They don't want the vagaries from administration to administration. They know this is a work in process. They know the issue of royalties are subject to negotiation between us and the Senate as this measure moves on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let's be clear about it. This measure, in short, I think reflects a thoughtful and informed process. Did everybody get everything they wanted? No. Is the process still moving along? Yes. We will continue to work with our colleagues of the loyal opposition as we try to endeavor to create a bill that reflects the best interests of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me quickly respond to the issue of the precious metals. This chart explains it very clearly. The U.S. Geologic Survey ranks the import reliance for nonfuel mineral materials. According to the USGS, there are 30 nonfuel minerals on which we are 80 to 100 percent reliant on imports. Simply put, we almost completely import these minerals, as has been stated, rather than produce them domestically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, that sounds worrisome, and the Republicans have noted that. But it is important that we realize that 19 of these 30 minerals, two-thirds of them, are not "locatable" and therefore are not subject to the 1872 mining law. So the reform of this law will have no effect on the production or the imports of those minerals. They will not be subject to the royalty we propose or the environmental standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of the other 11, all but one are simply not available in terms of commercially marketable quantities in the United States. We depend on imports of these minerals. Ones like graphite and rare earths do not exist in deposits where it is economical to produce them or they don't exist on public lands, so they are not subject to the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So if it ain't here, you can't mine it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only mineral among those 30 that are 100 percent import reliant into this country and impacts both the 1872 mining law and that are "locatable" minerals, the only one that is actually located in deposits large enough to be economically produced is fluorspar. Fluorspar. We are dependent upon fluorspar. Now let me tell you what we use fluorspar for: Toothpaste. We get fluorspar from China, Mexico, South Africa and Mongolia. We don't need to worry that the cleanliness of our teeth is in jeopardy  because of this mining law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The last time I checked, tooth decay, while distasteful, is not a national security issue. I ask that we support this measure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my good friend from California said we want to get the facts right; and if I heard him correctly, he said this bill is a work in progress. Now, we've had 135 years, according to him, to work on this bill, and we're going to rush it while it is still in progress. I really don't understand why we're going to take such a serious step as risking all the jobs in mines with work in progress. I think those were the words used and the facts used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth is we have a severe difference of opinion. I will quote from the chairman of the committee: No reason, no reason whatsoever why good public land law should be linked to the gross national product. That was in our markup hearing, and yet I would submit that energy production, timber production, water production, mineral production, they all affect the gross domestic product, and they are public land law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I really just believe that we have a complete disconnect in the committee between the majority and minority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Davis).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400633" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I have great respect and admiration for my neighbor, the chairman from West Virginia, for work that we've done in our river industries and supporting local industries; but I have to rise in objection to this bill. I think in some ways we might entitle it the Exporting America's Jobs Overseas Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I grew up around the American mining industry at the working-class end and got to see it from that side, one of the great transformations that took place during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s; and I think there are three core issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The law needs to be reformed, I agree, to adapt it to a 21st-century economy within which we live. However, the issue of competitiveness, the issue of American jobs and the issue of fundamental social justice all militate against this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, for the Democratic Caucus, from my friends on the other side who are committed to protecting jobs, I think it's amazing that we want to raise taxes on a core industry that's important to our supply chain, for our technology industry, to drive jobs overseas. It's going to increase material costs, increase our dependency on foreign hardrock minerals which has doubled over the last 10 years according to the U.S. Geological Survey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, there is a significant impact on jobs. Mining jobs and the mining support and supply chain jobs and industries that support that cannot be replaced by hospitality jobs. That is a flawed logic, in my mind; and it's very critical that we maintain the robustness of this industry as a strategic asset and a strategic resource.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For our future in energy, our future in manufacturing, we have to use the resources that we have in an environmentally friendly way to not only protect our jobs but to grow their jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I think the one thing I found in trade agreements through the years here in the House, there's always the discussion about a social justice component in establishing trade agreements with countries that may have  sweatshops, may abuse men, women and especially children. In this case, I would point out that areas where we get strategic materials now that will increase their industry are abusive of children. Specifically, you can see a picture  here of a child who's a Peruvian miner, children who are Colombian miners, and a Ugandan miner, all of whom are young children, all of whom are having their futures closed down because of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I oppose this bill. I ask that we yield back to the principles expounded by the gentleman from New Mexico and the gentleman from Alaska.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 1/2  minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my colleague from across the river from me in Kentucky that, as he knows, jobs in both our hardrock mining industry and our coal industry are on the decline already. Those jobs have been declining; and as the gentleman so well knows, as well as my colleagues on the minority side, these jobs are declining today because of the technologies that are coming in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Look at our coal industry. We're mining more coal as we're producing more hardrock minerals, but with less man and woman power because of the technologies that are replacing man and woman power. It's that simple.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So while the jobs may be on the decline, the production is on the upswing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say as well to my colleagues who raise the specter of here the Democrats go raising taxes again, note this week in the Wall Street Journal, this week the administration, the administration, not the Congress, announced that it's raising the royalty rates for oil and gas from the Gulf of Mexico to 18.75 percent from 16.67 percent for offshore leases to be offered next year. Even with this increase, the gulf will remain one of the lowest tax oil basins in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let's put this proposed 8 percent royalty on hardrock mining in perspective, please. It's less than half. Let's also keep in mind that hardrock mining is the only industry that pays no royalty on public lands, and all other countries and all States, for that matter, charge a royalty. Companies impose royalties and private agreements on hardrock mines. Let's keep in perspective what we're doing here; and, remember, it was the administration this week that raised royalties on Gulf of Mexico  leases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Farr).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400129" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> so we can, after 135 years, update the 1872 Mining Law. Since Ulysses S. Grant's administration in 1872, the Mining Law has governed hardrock mining on our public lands, public lands. Those are lands which you, the taxpayers, own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For nearly 100 years, those lands have been debated in Congress about changing policies that give away public resources and leave each new generation with a larger legacy of unreclaimed lands and degraded streams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Debate has continued. It's continued while northern California's Iron Mountain spewed nearly a quarter of the copper and zinc discharged by industries to the Nation's surface waters; during the decades of efforts to control acidic, metal-laden discharges from old sulfur mines southeast of Lake Tahoe; as historic lands of the Indian Pass in the area of Southern California in the desert area faced destruction from the proposed Glamis mine; and as California cities spend millions of dollars to treat  hazardous mine discharges and fight giant mining corporations in court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like the pollution problems it creates, the 1872 Mining Law persists, but that will now change with passage of this bill, and we owe that hard work to Chairman Rahall and to my colleague JIM COSTA from California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this congressional debate has continued after all these years, we've allowed mining companies to take billions of dollars' worth of gold, silver, and other minerals from our public lands for free. However, we will no longer treat that as we have not treated oil, coal, natural gas. So they will all now have to pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While countless hearings have been held, nearly 3.5 million acres of public lands have been deeded to mining claim holders for as little as $2.50 an acre. We've had to buy back some of this land to protect the unique ecological, recreational and cultural values, paying prices much higher than those set in the Mining Law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And during our long deliberation, the price tag for mining cleanup has risen astronomically. Since the House last acted on reform legislation, more than 20 mines and mills have been added to the infamous Superfund National Priority List, and the EPA Inspector General has warned that nearly $24 billion in cleanup costs from mine sites now exists, some of which will require treatment in perpetuity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, this is about to change. For today, the Hardrock Mining Reclamation Act of 2007 will do what it should have done years ago. I urge the passage of this important legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400313" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman again, the gentleman from California said let's talk about the facts. He said we do not have rare Earth. We do have rare Earth minerals; we don't have rare Earth mines. Those were shut down by the EPA due to lawsuits. U.S. companies developed the uses for rare Earths, and now we import them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Sali) who has done great work on this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412201" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the bill before us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Plain and simple, this bill is bad for America because it is bad policy. My concern centers around the long-lasting impacts that this bill will have on the First District of Idaho and on America's future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill imposes a royalty that will threaten the existence of domestic mineral production. Please note that mining is already one of the most regulated industries in the United States. Everyone believes that we need safe, productive, and environmentally responsible mineral development and that there needs to be a logical and efficient way to deal with abandoned mines. We all agree on those goals. But this bill takes an environmental cause, like abandoned mines, and uses it as a cover for a tax  hike that will accomplish nothing less than outsourcing our domestic mining industry. That is bad policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hardrock mining is dangerous. It takes a lot of grit to engage in it. Today, hardworking professionals do it here in the United States. This bill, however, will send American production overseas, where there are limited or no environmental standards and where child labor is used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman from Kentucky before me mentioned, <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> makes America more dependent on child miners from around the world for our minerals and metal needs. The International Labor Organization estimates there are over 1 million children that are working in mines and quarries around the world. This bill will not only ship our mining industry jobs overseas; it will ensure that American mineral needs are satisfied by child labor. That is just plain wrong; it is bad policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues across the aisle have made a commitment to the American people to combat global warming. This bill will ensure that they cannot meet that commitment. How are they going to combat global warming if they do not have the very minerals that they need to do it? Alternative energy is dependent on minerals that we mine here in the U.S. For instance, copper is used for wind, solar power, and fuel cells, just to name a few items. Currently, domestic production cannot meet domestic demand.  This is kind of like having the Democrats promise us sand castles but banning domestic sand. They're cutting off the domestic supply of minerals that they need to deliver on their commitment to fight global warming. Once again, <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> is bad policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mining industry jobs are important in the First District in Idaho. <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> will outsource these good-paying jobs that America and Idaho needs. <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> will take these jobs away from hardworking American professionals and force them on child laborers. Once again, <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> is bad policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My final point is this: our national defense depends on minerals mined in America. This bill will result in an importation of the very minerals we need to keep America safe from every unfriendly country from which we are protecting ourselves. Yes, that is right, we'll be asking our enemies to supply  us with the minerals used for the very weapons we will be using to defend ourselves from them. Once again, <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> is bad policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "no."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 1/2  minutes to the distinguished chairman of our Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands, my good friend, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400162" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an understatement to say that the West has changed dramatically since 1872, but this law that we are reforming today has not kept pace. Those of us from the West need this legislation to pass to protect the health of our communities, our scarce water supplies and our public lands, which are under continuing threat from an outdated mining law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of Arizona, hardrock mining has left behind a legacy of contaminated lands and rivers, abandoned mines leaching poisonous metals into groundwater and other hazards to the public, with hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars to reclaim and cleanup the mess left behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only a few months ago, a young girl was killed when she and her sister drove their vehicle into a mine shaft that had been left exposed after the site was abandoned. The mine shaft was hidden by brush, had no signs or barriers to warn anyone about the danger. The younger sister was trapped overnight with her sister's body before rescuers found them the next morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is just one heartbreaking example of the impacts of a law left over from another era, an era when the West was not populated and when our value system was far different from what it is now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The law simply must be updated to today's modern-day values and environmental standards. The issue of employment has been raised over and over again, exporting our jobs and importing our vital metals. I agree, mining jobs are good jobs, but I would suggest they are not the only jobs in the West. We need to have a diversified workforce, and that workforce needs what the population needs, diversified opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Rahall's bill puts standards in place, requiring cleanup and reclamation of mining sites. This bill makes certain that lands are off limits to mining, as they should be, but it also ends the free-for-all that this law has created over the years, where companies have used a patenting process to purchase inholdings within national forests and other public lands for a few dollars per acre, only to have the Federal Government later buy them out for millions of dollars when they  threaten to develop the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government has spent billions of dollars over the years rebuying patented mining lands, and taxpayers' are served much better for their money. They deserve a fairness and an equitable return for their tax dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support the balanced approach that the chairman has taken with this bill. I am also pleased that the committee approved amendments I offered to allow Native American tribes to petition the Secretary to withdraw from mining lands of cultural, historic or religious importance to them. Tribes have been just as impacted as other communities by the impacts of mining and should be able to weigh in on these important matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is an urgency here that cannot be understated. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will vote for this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400313" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would recognize the comments by the gentleman from West Virginia earlier about the administration, and I appreciate his praise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I don't always agree with the administration, I would say that the same administration he was praising has issued a veto threat because there is a constitutional abridgement that's possible in this bill, a takings violation, from the royalty structure. That would be a violation of the fifth amendment of the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that this work in progress should be sent back to the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Heller) who has done great work on the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412218" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I want to thank the ranking member for his hard work the last 10 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Rahall, for his efforts on the bill. He was very patient, very respectful. I appreciate his time and energy. We may disagree, but I certainly do appreciate him listening to my concerns and oppositions to this particular bill, so thank you so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, I thank the subcommittee chairman for a field hearing in Elko, Nevada. I certainly do appreciate that also, giving them a chance to be heard. I know that was appreciated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, mining is the second largest industry in the State of Nevada, which employs approximately 32,000 Nevadans, supporting, obviously, countless numbers of families. These high-paying jobs and their related services are the backbone of the rural community in our State and other rural economies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would take, for example, a couple, Larry and Vickie Childs of Spring Creek, Nevada. Larry retired from the mining industry approximately 25 years ago and subsequently went to work for a company in Elko, Nevada, providing miners the tools and equipment that they need. Vickie works at a health clinic for miners and their families provided by the two largest mining companies in the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vickie's clinic employs two pharmacists, four doctors, physician's assistants, nurses, lab technicians, maintenance and clerical people. Larry and Vickie raised four children in Elko, Nevada, one of whom currently today works in the mining industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When this bill closes down the local mining operations, the equipment suppliers and the health care clinics will have layoffs, and, obviously, close their doors. The Childs family will begin to lose their homes. The mining industry will join other domestic industry crushed by foreign competition and overregulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite opposition to this bill in Elko, one of the most affected communities by this bill, the new excessive taxes and burdensome regulations of this bill will kill this industry, and with that industry will go the towns and families that depend upon it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, this was not the result of the field hearing that the community had hoped for. All of these measures, many of the supporters will say, are in the name of fairness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question is, fairness to whom? Fairness to Nevada? Fairness to New Mexico? Arizona? I know that China thinks it's fair. I would guess that South Africa thinks that this is a fair bill. I would probably even guess that Australia thinks it is a fair bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But do you think it's a fair bill to the Childs family in Spring Creek and the many thousands like them? I don't think so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But just like this bill ignores the futures of the families in Nevada, <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> also fails to embrace the realities of the future of our Nation. India and China, with their State-funded purchases of global mineral commodities, should make us consider the long-term ramifications of the health of the domestic mining industry. Also, the technological advances we all want in our future, such as alternative energy, rely heavily on minerals and metals. A hybrid car, for example, requires twice as  much copper as a traditional SUV today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our national defense will rely on foreign sources of minerals to build our military equipment. Frankly, I don't want to rely on China when we are in a war-time situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support rural communities, urge them to support our domestic mining industry for the sake of our families, our economy, and our national security by voting against <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>, the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In doing so, I want to congratulate its lead sponsor, the chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources, NICK RAHALL. For 20 years now, NICK has led  the effort to reform mining laws which have been unchanged since 1872.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is high time that the 19th century mining law be updated to reflect our 21st century needs and goals. The current law was enacted before the invention of the telephone and was designed to promote mineral development in the age of the pick-and-shovel prospector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike virtually any other use of public lands, the 1872 mining law allows mining on public lands for hardrock minerals such as gold and copper without any compensation or royalty. It is time that this law be changed to reflect modern mining technologies and newer social values that question whether mineral extraction is always the best or highest use of the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a long-term member of the Natural Resources Committee, I want to once again commend Chairman Rahall for his commitment to mining reform, and he and Mr. Costa for producing a balanced bill which benefits American taxpayers who own the land, the environment and the mining industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400313" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, in order to, again, stick with facts that I think one of my colleagues mentioned we should, I would note that when we just heard the comment that no fees or dollars were taken from the mining industry, actually, $55 million was paid in claim maintenance fees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if we are to have this discussion about what effect this royalty is going to have, I think we should look at other circumstances. Again, these facts were presented in committee, in the committee hearings, but, somehow they did not get integrated into the bill, the knowledge, and again, it's the reason that we are passionate here on the floor about our points of view.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had testimony from British Columbia that instituted a 2.5 percent royalty. Now we are looking at an 8 percent, almost three times as much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if, as our opponents claim, there is no effect, that we can expect nothing, then you would think nothing happened in British Columbia. Yet, after they instituted, in 1 year, 1 year, revenues from the mines didn't increase because of this royalty; it decreased from 28 to 15, almost a 50 percent decrease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Exploration, likewise, fell dramatically from 38 to 15, far more than a 50 percent drop. That was in 1 year. The tax was repealed the next year because they found out exactly what we are claiming, that jobs were lost, 6,000 jobs were lost in 1 year. In 1972, the number of claims fell by 85 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when our opponents say there is not going to be any effect here, it's only right, we are asking them to pay the same amount that you pay for a snack at the grocery store. British Columbia did one-third of the tax that we are proposing. British Columbia found that they had to undo the tax because it was so destructive to the industry.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman and commend my colleague from West Virginia for bringing this legislation to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, we are doing a good thing here. The Mining Act of 1872 is as archaic and as deserving of updating as the name suggests. It was written at a time of manifest destiny, the belief of our predecessors, who held that we should expand from coast to coast and that mining was recognized as one of the best uses of public lands when the country seemed so vast that no one could imagine that human actions would affect the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many things have changed over 135 years. Our Nation is settled. We have come to realize the worth of our natural environment. We have come to comprehend the effects of human actions on the resources that we will pass down to future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is governing hardrock mining, an industry that's remained exempt from environmental regulations despite the fact that the U.S. EPA's toxic release inventory has determined that hardrock mining is a primary source of toxic pollution in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that in committee we have included language, important language, I would say, to restrict permits for activities that would harm national parks and national monuments. There are thousands of claims and could be thousands more in the close environment of national parks and national monuments, some of our most treasured lands. This legislation will provide vital protection for those lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know well the costs to American taxpayers of refusing to look after the environment. This language about national parks, I think, will also save the taxpayer money, because we will have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up damage to water supplies and so forth.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I think when we are discussing these facts, we should be talking about the critical facts, as I am sure that the gentleman was correct that we do import fluorspar, and it probably is used on toothpaste, but we probably should be talking about the domestic security, about the security of our Nation, about the willingness of our industry and the capability of our industry to provide the instruments to defend this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are at a time when terrorists are trying to overcome us, al Qaeda, radical jihad. The terrorists are trying every way they can, and we are going to put the source of critical minerals that are necessary for our Nation's offense outside the Nation's borders.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when I look on the walls of this Chamber, I see the quote by Daniel Webster up above the Speaker's chair, and it says: "Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether we also, in our day and generation, may not perform something worthy to be remembered."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Worthy to be remembered. I think our Founding Fathers had it right. They visualized a nation of tremendous promise, where the wealth of the Nation and the protection of the Nation would come together in the production of its resources and in the taking care of its land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't find it unusual at all that the same generation protected Yellowstone and yet gave us the capability to create these mines, which take billions of dollars to promote and to produce. I don't find that unusual at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what I do find unusual is that our friends on the other side of the aisle are not listening to their own testimony coming in their own hearings. We heard testimony from both Democrat and Republican witnesses alike saying 8 percent royalties are unprecedented. They are damaging, destructive, they will hurt. Those are the things that we heard in the committee.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>While we acknowledge the need to revise some of the same federal laws that <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> modifies, we believe the legislation would unjustifiably harm the domestic mining industry, and the Alaska mining industry in particular.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our state produced almost $3 billion of minerals last year, four percent of the nation's total. We can continue and even expand this contribution indefinitely, but not without predictable access, on reasonable fiscal terms, to the federal domain in Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Your legislation, <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>, would create several obstacles to such access and terms. Specifically:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prohibiting mining exploration and development on lands identified in the 2001 Forest Service "roadless rule" and in other "special areas" would place millions of acres off limits. These prohibitions are far too broad, particularly in Alaska where the federal government owns so much land, yet already offers so little of it to mineral exploration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A flat royalty on gross revenues will cause unnecessary mine shutdowns and job losses during periods of low prices. The government should adopt a flexible royalty that adjusts for high and low returns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposed new permitting system would unnecessarily duplicate existing laws while also creating great uncertainty and thus great risk for mineral exploration and development. We believe it could end exploration and mining on federal lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for considering these views and the attached position paper as Congress works to reform the nation's mining laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom Irwin,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NATIONAL MINING ASSOCIATION,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, October 29, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CONGRESSMAN ABERCROMBIE: The National Mining Association (NMA) supports updating the Mining Law in a manner that produces a fair and predictable public policy capable of sustaining a healthy domestic hard rock mining industry and providing a fair return to the taxpayer for the use of federal lands. House members will soon be asked to vote on the "Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007" (<bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>). NMA opposes <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> because it jeopardizes current and future sources of domestic  minerals that are critical to our nation's economic well-being and security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NMA believes that the Mining Law can be responsibly updated in way that does not sacrifice American jobs or endanger the nation's security. Our domestic mineral and mining industry supports 169,500 direct and indirect jobs, produces metals valued at more than $16 billion and pays direct personal and payroll taxes totaling $830 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NMA finds the following features of <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> particularly objectionable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Excessive Royalty (Tax): The bill would impose the world's highest royalty on mineral production--a new tax on America's minerals that are critical to our economic vitality and national security. The tax would take the form of an 8 percent gross royalty, which would cause a significant reduction in mineral and mining investments. NMA supports a fair return to the public in the form of a net income production payment for minerals produced from new mining claims on federal lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Retroactive Levy on Existing Mines: The bill would retroactively levy a 4 percent gross royalty on existing mines where business plans and investments were implemented without this significant cost in mind. Apart from the doubtful legality of such a levy, it virtually guarantees the closure of some mines and the export of high-paying mining-related jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Confiscation of Investments: Several provisions of <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> would empower political appointees to stop new mining projects even when such projects have met all applicable environmental and legal requirements. No business can attract the necessary capital or operate with such regulatory uncertainty and, as you would expect, those investments and projects will move overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our country is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign sources of minerals critical to virtually every sector of our economy. Our national minerals policy should support, not destroy, the investments, jobs and infrastructure necessary to supply our domestic mineral needs. We urge you to oppose <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> so a more balanced measure can be developed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely yours,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kraig R. Naasz,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>MANUFACTURERS,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>October 30, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR REPRESENTATIVES: On behalf of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), the nation's largest industrial trade association representing small and large manufacturers in every industrial sector and in all 50 states, I urge vou to oppose <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>, the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. mining industry currently provides about 50 percent of the metals American manufacturers need to operate, including iron ore, copper, gold, phosphate, zinc, silver and molybdenum. The U.S. has become increasingly dependent upon foreign sources of minerals for products that are strategically important to both our national and economic security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than encouraging environmentally safe mineral development, <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> would impose new taxes on the mining industry, including an eight percent royalty on new mining and a retroactive four percent royalty on existing mining operations. The bill would also establish new prohibitions on future mining on certain public lands and set highly prescriptive environmental standards that sometimes conflict with existing state and federal regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only would the bill seriously impact the U.S. mining industry, it would increase the cost of raw materials for U.S. manufacturers, make our products less competitive in global markets and adversely affect thousands of high-paying manufacturing jobs. Moreover, we remain concerned that this sets an unwise precedent in targeting specific industries with new and burdensome tax increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NAM's Key Vote Advisory Committee has indicated that votes on <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> will be considered for designation as Key Manufacturing Votes in the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for your consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senior Vice President for Policy</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Englewood, CO, October 30, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CONGRESSMEN: as an operator of two domestic metal mines with over 500 employees, I would like to urge you to vote "NO" on the "Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007" (<bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>). As longstanding members of the mining community in the United States, we are concerned that <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> as it currently stands will negatively affect domestic supply of the metals and minerals needed to ensure our future economic prosperity. The new taxes imposed, and more importantly, the retroactive  taxes proposed, will have a chilling effect on our industry. The uncertainty of mining rights will make domestic investment in new mines difficult, undoubtedly increasing our dependence on foreign minerals and eliminating countless jobs in the US.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, American hard rock miners are the highest paid in the world earning excellent salaries and receiving unmatched benefits. Congress will drive these jobs overseas if it approves <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>, which impose the highest minerals tax in the world!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are dedicated to reforming Mining Law to ensure a fair return to taxpayers and allow businesses to stay open, preserve high-wage American jobs and prevent further increases in our dependence on foreign minerals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of our 500 employees, I urge you to vote "NO" on the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Very truly yours,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>MARK A. SMITH,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, October 30, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CONGRESSMAN ABERCROMBIE: I am writing on behalf of the members of the American Copper Policy Council (ACPC) to indicate our opposition to <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>, the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007. Reform of the mining law is long over-due, but this legislation in its present form would impose new costs and regulatory burdens that would make the U.S. mining industry uncompetitive in the world marketplace. In addition to stifling new mining investment, <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> would increase our  domestic manufacturing sectors dependence on imported raw materials, particularly from manufacturing economies such as China. In the case of copper, this could discourage the use of a valuable material that positively contributes to green construction and improved energy efficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ACPC members are involved in all facets of copper mining, production, fabrication and distribution and as such play a critical role in nearly all domestic manufacturing, which is vital to the national economy and defense. Mining law amendments must recognize the need to strike a balance between providing a fair return to the public for minerals extracted on federal lands and ensuring that our U.S. mining industry can continue to compete and provide our industrial base with a reliable supply of  domestic minerals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> would impose a royalty that is higher than any other mining country in the world. A royalty is imposed on new mines and also retroactively on existing mines on federal lands. The bill fails to provide assurances that significant investments on public lands will not be placed at risk by arbitrary and capricious restrictions by regulators, and it imposes redundant and conflicting environmental standards on mining contrary to a finding by the National Research Council that current laws  protect the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We support reform but let's make sure it is good reform. At a time when our manufacturing base is struggling to compete in a world marketplace that is not always level, we need to consider the ramifications of legislation on our industrial base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for your consideration of our concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>LINDA D. FINDLAY, </paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Copper Policy Council's members include the Copper Development Association, the Copper and Brass Fabricators Council, the Copper and Brass Servicenter Association, the International Copper Association, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, Rio Tinto, and Freeport McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold, Inc.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, on January 28, 1872, Representative Sergeant brought to the House floor from the Committee on Mines and Mining <bill type="h" number="1016">H.R. 1016</bill>, the bill that was to be enacted as the Mining Law of 1872. He noted that debate had taken place whether it was worthwhile for the government to sell the mineral lands of the United States, some thought, on some idea of a royalty belonging to the government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, the Members debating that measure decided to allow for the patenting of mining claims for $2.50 or $5 an acre, depending on whether it was allowed to place their claim because, in the words of Representative Sergeant, "We are inducing miners to purchase their claims so that large amounts of money are thereby brought into the Treasury of the United States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, now, perhaps back then $2.50 an acre represented a large amount of money. But I submit it does not today. And the royalty debated back when this law was passed is what, ironically, we are debating today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the gentleman from New Mexico has said that in order to pay that $2.50 an acre you have to mine the land. I would say that that is an inaccurate description of current law. You do not necessarily have to mine the land. You have to show that there's a valuable mineral that exists therein, which is not a very hard proposition to show these days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that noted, let me state that I've engaged in the effort to reform the Mining Law of 1872 these past many years, not just for the apparent reasons, valuable minerals mined for free, the threats to health and human safety from abandoned mine lands, but also because I am pro-mining, I come from a coal mining State, because I no longer believe that we can expect a viable hardrock mining industry to exist on public domain lands in the future if we do not make corrections to the law today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do so because there are provisions of the existing law which impede efficient and serious mineral exploration and development. And I do so because of the unsettled political climate governing this activity. With reform, if not coming in a comprehensive fashion, certainly it will continue to come on a piecemeal basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues come to the floor to vote on this issue, I hope they will ask their staffs just how many letters from how many mining groups have they received in opposition to the pending bill. I hope they'll bring those letters to the floor with them, because I submit there will not be many. And I submit the reason may be, using my intuition, could the responsible segments of the hardrock mining industry, which is the majority, could the responsible segment of that hardrock mining industry  want to end the uncertainty that exists over this industry? Could it be that they want a finality to the arguments surrounding their industry? Could it be that they want a basis upon which to make business and future investment decisions?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And hardly today are they screaming pauper. Look at this week's Wall Street Journal headline: "Gold Rush of 2007. Mining Mergers."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The price is pretty well up there these days. I think these companies are doing quite well, and they would like to have some finality on this issue. I believe that, with enough courage, as we've seen from elected officials, hunters, sportsmen, fishermen from across the West, we can continue to address the problems facing mining and dovetail our need for minerals with the necessity of protecting our environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For at stake here in this debate over the Mining Law of 1872 is the health, welfare, and environmental integrity of our people and on our Federal lands. At stake is the public interest of all Americans. And at stake is the ability of the hardrock mining industry to continue to operate on public domain lands in the future to produce those minerals that are necessary to maintain our standard of living.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the adoption of this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF">
    <paragraph>I rise in very strong support of <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>, and I congratulate its sponsor, Chairman NICK RAHALL. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007 will finally end the give-away of our public lands and minerals. The bill secures a fair return for taxpayers on minerals taken from public lands, and it will provide for environmental standards and cleanup for hardrock mining.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 135 years, American hardrock mining policy has given away public resources, and it has left each new generation a larger legacy of unreclaimed lands and degraded streams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 1872 mining law is long overdue for comprehensive reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American taxpayers deserve an updated mining policy, and so does our natural environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman RAHALL and I have been striving to update this antiquated law for decades, and thanks to his leadership, we are closer today to success than we have ever been.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Natural Resources Committee's effort to reform mining law began in the early 1990s, when I chaired the committee, but we were derailed by the Republican rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman RAHALL has spent 20 years introducing bills in this House to get to this point. He has persevered against indifference, opposition, and intensive lobbying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, he has brought a bill to the floor of the House that takes a major step towards reform after many long years of struggle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 1872 mining law allows mining companies to take billions of dollars worth of gold, silver and other minerals from public lands for free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We no longer treat any other resource that way--not coal, oil, or gas--yet under the archaic mining law, we still give away gold with no compensation to the taxpayers who own it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And over the years, the price tag for mining cleanup has risen astronomically. Since the House last acted on reform legislation, more than 20 mines and mills have been added to the Superfund National Priority List.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The EPA Inspector General has warned of nearly $24 billion in cleanup costs for mine sites, some of which will require treatment "in perpetuity."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 1872 law's failings have had a serious impact on California and the West. The mining law has remained in effect while Northern California's Iron Mountain mine spewed out nearly a quarter of the copper and zinc discharged by industries to the Nation's surface waters; as historic lands of the Indian Pass area in the southern California desert faced destruction from the proposed Glamis mine; during decades of efforts to control acidic, metal-laden discharges from an old sulfur mine southeast  of Tahoe; and as the city of Grass Valley spends millions to treat hazardous mine discharges and fight a giant mining corporation in court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that is before us today, the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007, will: put certain irreplaceable public lands off limits to mining, secure a fair return for taxpayers with a royalty on minerals taken from public lands, halt the sale of public lands to mining claimholders, adopt modern environmental standards for hardrock mining; and establish a program to clean up abandoned mines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, NICK RAHALL, and Energy Subcommittee Chairman JIM COSTA, our California colleague, for their leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to commend the staff of the Natural Resources committee for their years of hard work to get us to this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to support this major legislative accomplishment, which will be celebrated by future generations of Americans.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400412" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a proud cosponsor of the bill, I want to begin by congratulating Chairman RAHALL, the lead sponsor of <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> and our leader on the Natural Resources Committee, for all he has done to make it possible for the House to consider the bill today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many years, he has worked to replace the ancient mining law of 1872 with a statute more attuned to this era than to the days of the Grant administration--a worthy task that remains unfinished through no fault of his.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For him, it is personal. And it is personal for me as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My uncle, Stewart Udall, had the honor of serving as Secretary of the Interior during the administrations of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. During his tenure, he accomplished a great deal, but he wanted to do more. He has often said that reform of the mining law of 1872 was the biggest unfinished business on the Nation's natural resources agenda, and  has never let me forget that one of his final actions as Secretary was to send to Congress proposed  legislation to accomplish that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, as Chairman RAHALL has reminded us all, my father, Representative Morris K. Udall, recognized the need for legislation such as the bill before us today. As chairman of what was then the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, he also accomplished a great deal, but he did not live to see that need fulfilled through its enactment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, I consider myself very fortunate to have the opportunity to join in supporting this bill and, by so doing, helping to accomplish what both my father and uncle recognized as a long-overdue step to provide the American people--owners of the Federal lands--with a fair return for development of "hardrock" minerals and to establish a better balance between the development of those minerals and the other uses of those lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those are the purposes of this bill, and I think it is well designed to accomplish them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Its enactment will replace the mining law of 1872 with a new statutory framework for the development of hardrock minerals on Federal lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps most notably, it will impose a royalty on gross income from hardrock mining on Federal land. Under current law, those who mine gold, silver, platinum, or other hardrock minerals from those lands pay no royalties at all--unlike those who extract oil, natural gas, or other minerals covered by the Mineral Leasing Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The royalty rate would be 8 percent of "net smelter return" for new mines and mine expansions, and a 4 percent net smelter rerun for production from existing mines. Those royalties, to the extent they exceed the costs of administering the new law, would go into a special fund in the Treasury and, along with certain administrative fees, would be available, subject to appropriation, to support reclamation programs and to provide assistance to State, local, and tribal governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I consider the establishment of this "abandoned hardrock mine reclamation fund" one of the most important features of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very important for Colorado because while mining brought many benefits to our State, it has also left us with too many worked-out and abandoned mines. Some of them are mere open pits or shafts that endanger hunters, hikers, or other visitors. And too many are the source of pollution that contaminates the nearby land and nearby streams or other bodies of water, and so are threats to public health as well as to the ranchers and farmers who depend on water to make a living and the fish and  wildlife for whom it is life itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, I have seen credible estimates indicating that the Western States have as many as 500,000 abandoned hardrock mines, and that just in Colorado there are over 20,000 old mines, shafts, and exploration holes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, Mr. Chairman, there is an urgent need to clean up and reclaim these abandoned mines. But there are two major obstacles to progress toward that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One is a lack of funds for cleaning up sites for which no private person or entity can be held liable. The reclamation fund established by this bill will be a major step toward remedying that problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other obstacle is the fact that while many people would like to undertake the work of cleaning up abandoned mines, these would-be "good Samaritans" are deterred because they fear that under the Clean Water Act or other current law someone undertaking to clean up an abandoned or inactive mine will be exposed to the same liability that would apply to a party responsible for creating the site's problems in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because that obstacle is not addressed by this bill, I have introduced a separate measure--H.R. 4011--that does address it. That bill, similar to ones I introduced in the 107th, 108th and 109th Congresses, reflects valuable input from representatives of the Western Governors' Association and other interested parties, including staff of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Environmental Protection Agency. It represents years of effort to reach agreement on establishing a program  to advance the cleanup of polluted water from abandoned mines. It is cosponsored by our colleague from New Mexico, Representative PEARCE, whose help I greatly appreciate, and I will be seeking to have it considered as soon as practicable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another important aspect of the bill before us is the way it would modify the administrative and judicial procedures related to mining activities, including establishing a means for local governments to petition for withdrawal of Federal land from the staking of new mining claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That will enable local governments all over Colorado to have a much greater voice regarding activities that could have the potential to cause problems for their residents and for them to seek protection for such resources and values as watersheds and drinking water supplies, wildlife habitats, cultural or historic resources, scenic areas. In addition, Indian tribes will be able to seek protections for religious and cultural values.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize that not everyone supports the bill as it stands. The Colorado Mining Association has informed me that while its members support reforming the 1872 mining law, they think the royalty rate that the bill would apply to new production is too high, and that they consider application of even a lower rate to existing production is unfair. I respect their views--although I don't think it is accurate to describe the royalty on existing production as "retroactive," because  it will not apply to any production occurring prior to the bill's enactment--and I am ready to consider supporting changes in the royalty rates as the legislative process continues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill, one that deserves our support. In the words of a recent editorial in the Daily Sentinel newspaper of Grand Junction, CO, it is "long- overdue and much-needed legislation." I urge its passage, and for the benefit of all our colleagues I attach the complete text of the Daily Sentinel's editorial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[From the (Grand Junction, CO) Daily Sentinel, Oct. 18, 2007]</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Archaic Mining Law Needs 21st-Century Update</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mining industry that transformed huge swaths of western Colorado's landscape in the latter part of the 19th century was given a considerable boost by the 1872 Mining Law. And that legal antique continues to transform public lands in the state today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, long-overdue and much-needed legislation to finally reform the 135-year-old law is to be marked up in the House Natural Resources Committee today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mining legislation signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant was adopted when most Americans enthusiastically supported both the development of the largely unpopulated West by white settlers and full exploitation of its natural resources. Along with laws such as the Homestead Act and the Timber and Stone Act, the 1872 Mining Law helped drive that effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over time, however, public-lands laws passed in the late 19th century have been eliminated or superseded. Only the 1872 Mining Law remains in largely its original form, allowing companies and individuals to stake mining claims on federal lands and eventually purchase those lands for as little as $5 an acre.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Colorado since 1980, 17 companies and 40 individuals have obtained mineral rights and deeds to more than 84,000 acres of once-public land under the 1872 law, according to a study by the Environmental Working Group. Four more applications are pending to acquire deeds to mining claims in Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, unlike companies that lease the rights to recover coal, oil and gas from public lands, those who obtain gold, silver and other precious metals under the 1872 law contribute nothing to the federal treasury through leasing or royalty payments. And because there were no environmental requirements in the law, U.S. taxpayers are footing the bill to clean up thousands of old mine sites around the West.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before the committee would end the practice of selling federal lands for hard-rock mining. People could lease lands for mining--as they do with coal, oil and gas--but they could not gain ownership of them, often for a tiny fraction of their current value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the bill to reform the 1872 Mining Law would establish an 8 percent royalty for new mines. It would improve environmental rules, create reclamation bonding requirements for mines and give federal land managers more authority to balance hard-rock mining with other public-lands activity. Not surprisingly, industry lobbyists are trying to water it down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Western Colorado's two House members, Mark Udall and John Salazar, support the bill. Others should, too. It's long past time this 19th century relic was revamped to reflect the new realities of the 21st century.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak in favor of <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>, the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007, introduced by my good friend, Chairman Rahall. In 1991, I introduced the Mining Law Reform Act of 1991, which was very similar to the legislation that we are considering today. The following year, I introduced an amendment to another mining reform bill--also introduced by Chairman Rahall--that would have put a 12.5 percent royalty on hardrock minerals mined  on Federal public lands. It is beyond belief that for the past 135 years, the law has allowed these minerals to be extracted with no royalty paid to the American people, unlike the royalties paid by oil, gas, and coal developers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, I am very familiar with the issues involved in hardrock mining and the efforts to reform the antiquated 1872 mining law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, none of these previous measures became law. Today, however, we have a real chance at mining reform. I am glad for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> is a vast improvement over the 1872 mining law that currently guides mineral development on our public lands. Still, it could be improved further.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the markup of this bill held by the Natural Resources Committee, I offered an amendment that would have clarified that the royalty  provisions of <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> do not apply to small miners, many of whom reside in my district in Oregon. The Bureau of Land Management estimates that there are approximately 3,400 small miners in Oregon that hold 10 or fewer claims, who engage in casual use of the public lands for hand panning, nonmotorized sluicing, and other  small, recreational mining activities. Unfortunately, my amendment was not approved by the committee, although Chairman Rahall agreed to work with me to address my concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I intended to offer the same amendment to <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> here today on the floor, to do just that. The Rules Committee, however, did not make my amendment in order. Therefore, I rise today to speak on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am told by Chairman Rahall and his staff that the underlying bill does not apply to recreational miners, or those miners engaged in casual use of the public lands; i.e., those mining activities that do not ordinarily result in any disturbance of public lands and resources. Sections 302 and 304 of <bill type="h" number="2622">H.R. 2622</bill> indicate that miners engaged in casual use do not have to get a permit to mine, and section 103 states that miners who hold less than 10 claims are exempt from paying the maintenance  fee required under the act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am told that this language, combined with existing regulations, means that recreational miners are not subject to the royalty provisions of <bill type="h" number="2622">H.R. 2622</bill>. I remain unconvinced that this is the case, which is why I wanted to offer my amendment. If it is true that small miners are not covered by this legislation, then adding clarifying language should not have been a problem. If the bill is in fact unclear, my amendment would have clarified it. In addition, my amendment would have addressed concerns  raised by Chairman Rahall that exempting small miners from royalty payments was a slippery slope, and that the exemption would have reduced revenues to the Federal Government. Nevertheless, I was not permitted to offer my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, let me be clear now, it is not my intention that the royalty provisions of <bill type="h" number="2622">H.R. 2622</bill>--specifically, section 102 of the legislation--apply to small recreational miners engaged in casual use of the public lands for mining. Hand panning, the use of hand tools, and other similar activities that work public lands for enjoyment or to supplement one's income is a time-honored tradition in this country, and explicitly anticipated by a variety of Federal laws governing the multiple use of these  lands. While a revamp of the 1872 mining law is more than overdue, including placing royalties on the minerals extracted from Federal lands, we must ensure that small, recreational mining opportunities are not lost. My amendment would have guaranteed protection for small miners. I am disappointed that I was unable to offer it today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have made my concerns known to my colleagues in the Senate, and have provided them with copies of my amendment. When this legislation reaches their Chamber, I will call on them to ensure that small miners are not subject to the royalty provisions of this bill. Until then, I will reserve my judgment on whether I will support a final conference report on mining reform.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to applaud and congratulate my good friend, Chairman Rahall for his efforts to bring this legislation to the House floor. He has worked over many years to reform the mining law and because of his persistence, we have a better chance of finally securing reform than we ever have. Reform is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am supporting this legislation, but I wish to continue to work with the chairman and follow the actions of the Senate to make sure final legislation does not inadvertently create a system that makes our domestic industry unable to compete in the world marketplace. Mining has a long and colorful history in the State of Arizona and it provides great benefit to the State's economy. I believe we can have reform and also preserve a healthy industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know the chairman shares that objective, and again I applaud him and his staff for making this issue a priority.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>, the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> will put new royalty rates on production from hardrock mining. For the other side, of course, royalty rates is a fun, new catchword meaning taxes. But, unlike the coal and petroleum industry who are taxed on production of product, <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> will place the tax on the amount of material extracted. For example, if "Joe Voter Mining" moves 1 cubic yard of rock weighing in the neighborhood of 800 pounds to retrieve \1/10\th or 1 ounce of gold, Joe would not be taxed on the gold recovered,  but on the amount of rock moved. By raising taxes like this, the bill will cripple American production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the 110th Congress convened, the Pelosi-led majority has been talking about the need for "renewable" energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The energy bills, that were rammed through the House and put large tax increases on the oil and natural gas industries placed a large emphasis on renewable energy; wind and solar. So why would this bill punish renewable energy?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, western Iowa does not have a hardrock mining industry. Thankfully for our farmers, we don't have much hardrock in western Iowa. But what we do have is large-scale production of renewable energy. The Fifth District of Iowa is the leader in production of BTU's of renewable energy: ethanol, biodiesel, and wind. However, this bill will put a cramp on further production of renewable energy. I want to let my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in on a little secret, those ethanol and biodiesel  plants require steel and copper. Those wind chargers that produce clean, renewable electricity from the air sit on large steel columns. The electricity that is produced by wind chargers and solar panels is transported via copper wires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, steel and copper come from the ground. So I want to try and figure out the Democrat logic. They are going to tax the raw resources that are used by the renewable industry to make a product the Democrats want to see more of? That doesn't sound like sound logic to me. I would just hope that what my Democrat colleagues realize is that which you tax, you get less of. If they want less renewable energy, then taxing the resources used in its production is a sure way to make that happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, today, oil is over $90 a barrel and natural gas is over $8 per million cubic feet because of Democrat energy policies. And in an absurd response, the Democrats aim to crush the renewable industry by raising the rates on the materials the renewable energy industry is built on. I urge my colleagues to oppose <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>, the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to mark the passage of <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>, the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act. <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> takes long overdue action to reform the 1872 Mining Act. That law, the General Mining Act of 1872, was written to encourage westward expansion and to generate the supply of minerals needed in our Nation. Back in 1872, a charge of $5 an acre to mine hard rock minerals in remote areas of the undeveloped west was probably a pretty fair price. The fact that the  price is still the same today is simply ludicrous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, private companies, both domestic and foreign, have been able to profit handsomely by mining on public lands without the need to pay the American people any royalties or to even clean up the messes they leave behind. By some estimates, the antiquated 1872 Mining Act has allowed over $245 billion worth of minerals to be extracted from more than 3.4 million acres of public lands without returning to the American people, the owners of those lands, a single cent in royalties. Today, we  took a necessary step toward bringing this policy into the modern era.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>, introduced by Representative NICK RAHALL, the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, requires mining companies to pay royalties to the American people for the minerals they mine from public lands and to properly reclaim lands damaged by mining. It also allows for the prohibition of mining on environmentally sensitive lands, and it creates a fund to begin the clean up of nearly a half million abandoned mine sites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I sincerely hope that the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act sees swift passage in the other Chamber so we can send it to the President to be signed into law. Even though we have already waited 135 years to take action on this matter, time is truly of the essence. In 1872, hardrock mining mostly took place in the middle of vast undeveloped lands. Today, however, with over 375,000 mining claims spread throughout the rapidly developing West, some of our last pieces of unspoiled lands are threatened.  According to the New York Times, many of those 375,000 claims are within 5 miles of 11 major national parks, including Death Valley and the Grand Canyon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 89,000 of those claims were staked in 2006, largely due to the renewed interest in nuclear energy and the concomitant increase in the price of uranium. In New Mexico alone, almost 2,000 claims were staked in 2006. Many New Mexicans, most particularly members of the Navajo Nation, have already suffered devastating injuries from uranium mining in the past. <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> will bring some much needed balance to the use of our public lands and, in so doing, help protect the health of our citizens.  I am proud to support Chairman RAHALL's efforts and I encourage our colleagues in the other Chamber to do the same.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>, the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act, which will reform the General Mining Law of 1872 and provide a fair return to the American taxpayer of publicly owned minerals on Federal lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By charging a royalty for publicly owned minerals, the American taxpayer will no longer have to bear the cost of reclaiming and restoring abandoned hardrock mines. <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> will  assure that future mines operate in a manner that conserves the environment and our valuable natural resources, including fish and wildlife habitats.</paragraph>

By charging a royalty fee on existing and future mining operations, along with filing and maintenance fees, the Congressional Budget Office has determined this legislation would reduce our country's deficit, which has spiraled out of control under the current administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues today to update the 1872 Mining Law for the 21st century and vote for this important legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400387" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of reforming one of the most antiquated laws still on the books. The General Mining Law of 1872 has remained essentially unchanged since Ulysses S. Grant was President. Originally intended to spur westward expansion, the law has become an environmental and fiscal train wreck. Today we have a chance to reform this relic by passing the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007 (<bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back in 1872 individual miners used hand tools to look for gold and silver; now multi-national corporations blast the tops off of mountains and produce chemicals such as cyanide, arsenic, and mercury that leach into streams and groundwater long after mining operations cease. Much has changed, but the law has not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 135 years, mining companies have been the beneficiaries of public largesse that would make even Haliburton blush: over $245 billion worth of minerals have been removed from public lands virtually free of charge. Taxpayers have then been expected to foot the bill for the massive cleanup of abandoned mines to the tune of at least $30 billion. Under the 1872 law, mining takes precedence over ever other concern--environmental protection, recreation, or safety. The mining industry, which is responsible  for more Federal Superfund sites than any other industry, pays no royalties on extracted metals. In addition, through the "patent" process, companies can force the sale of public lands for as little as $2.50 per acre. Patenting has resulted in the sale of over 3 million acres of public property at far below market value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of California, a recent study found over 21,000 existing mining claims within 10 miles of national parks, monuments, and wilderness areas. The 285 claims within 10 miles of Yosemite threaten one of the Nation's most visited and spectacular parks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us protects sensitive lands in California and throughout the West by creating environmental safeguards, transparency, and public participation. Some lands, such as wilderness study areas, would be completely off-limits. In other areas, new mines would be permitted only after a showing that they are not environmentally destructive. Local governments can also challenge new projects. The bill restores fiscal sanity by ending the practice of "patenting" and requiring that new mines  pay an 8 percent royalty and existing mines pay 4 percent, both reasonable rates and well below what the coal and oil industries pay. These royalties are then put into a fund to pay for the cleanup of old mines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to fix a law that deserves to disappear into the dustbin of history. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for reform.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400218" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> because it will finally compensate American taxpayers for the minerals that are extracted from public federal lands and, at the same time, dedicate this revenue to restoring wildlife habitat, drinking water supplies, and other natural resources that have been ruined by mining operations. Mr. Chairman, these changes are long overdue, and I commend Chairman RAHALL for bringing this bill to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The importance of mining to the settlement and development of the West and to western economies today cannot be overstated. Therefore, this bill does not seek to destroy the U.S. mining industry, but to bring it out of the 19th century and into the 21st. The Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act at long last will force U.S. law to recognize that our public lands belong to all U.S. citizens, and any activities or industries that utilize those lands must do so for the benefit of all Americans. This  bill will hold the mining industry responsible for the public minerals it extracts and for the environmental consequences of their operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past 135 years, the mining industry has had easy access to federal lands and was free to take what it wanted and then leave the lands in whatever condition they chose. The American taxpayer gave up their rights to these minerals and then took up the bill for cleaning up lands polluted with toxic chemicals. <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> rightfully imposes a royalty fee on mining companies, similar to that paid by oil, coal, and natural gas companies who drill and mine on federal lands, which the Department  of the Interior will use to fund environmental restoration and reclamation of abandoned mines. It is only fair that the mining industry pay to repair the damage it has done to natural resources, including drinking water supplies and prime habitat for wildlife and outdoor recreation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This last point is very important to me. As an avid hunter and outdoorsman, it is critically important to me that we maintain our Nation's natural heritage for current and future generations. Federal lands harbor some of the most important fish and wildlife habitat and provide some of the finest hunting and angling opportunities in the country. For example, public lands contain more than 50 percent of the Nation's blue-ribbon trout streams and are strongholds for imperiled trout and salmon in  the western United States. More than 80 percent of the most critical habitat for elk is found on lands managed by the Forest Service and the BLM, alone. Pronghorn antelope, sage grouse, mule deer, salmon and steelhead, and countless other fish and wildlife species are similarly dependent on public lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why sportsmen's organizations around the country support reform of the Mining Law of 1872. By passing this bill today, we will ensure the continued viability of wildlife habitat and the continued ability of hunters, anglers, and outdoor enthusiasts to pursue and pass on our sporting heritage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> just makes good sense. By holding the mining industry accountable for its own actions and making it live up to certain basic environmental standards, this bill will protect the rights of all American citizens while ensuring that mining will continue in a balanced and responsible manner. I support <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>, and I urge my colleagues to vote for its passage today.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400238" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>, the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act. Reform of this 135-year-old law is long overdue, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this needed legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant signed the General Mining Law. The intention of the law was to promote the settlement of the American West. Under the 1872 law, mining companies do not pay any royalties for the publicly-owned "hardrock" minerals mined on federal lands. Over the years, mining companies have been able to extract hundreds of billions of dollars in gold, silver, platinum, copper, and uranium without paying royalties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to overhaul this archaic law. Let me be clear that this bill does not affect privately-owned land, but rather federal lands that belong to all Americans. The American people deserve a fair return for the minerals extracted from the lands they own. By comparison, the coal, oil, and gas companies already pay royalties for their operations on federal lands. Why should hardrock mining be any different? Virtually every other nation that allows mining on public lands imposes some form of  royalty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opponents of this bill claim that charging an 8 percent royalty on new hardrock mines and setting some basic environmental standards will devastate the domestic mining industry and send mining jobs overseas. I read in the paper this morning that the price of gold hit just hit a 27-year high of $800 an ounce. Platinum is now selling for $1,447 an ounce. The worldwide demand for copper is so high that thieves have taken to stealing phone lines in some areas so they can sell the copper at recycling  yards. Yet, in the face of these facts, opponents of the bill implausibly argue that the mining industry in this country will collapse if we don't continue to give away publicly-owned minerals for free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting to bring this 19th century mining law into the 21st century.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>, the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act, which requires hardrock mining companies to pay the government royalties for their operations on federal land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, the General Mining Law of 1872 allows mining companies to stake claims on public lands without paying royalties to the government. Claimholders are able to purchase public lands where their mines are located for as little as $2.50 an acre.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is that there is no good reason that hardrock mining companies should be exempt from royalties for using land that belongs to all Americans. It is time we treat the hardrock mining industry just as we do coal, oil, and gas companies who operate on public lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, miners of coal on public lands pay 8 percent on underground deposits and 12.5 percent on surface deposits. Drillers of oil and natural gas pay 8 percent to 16.7 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congressional Budget Office estimates that $1 billion in hardrock minerals are extracted annually from federal lands. Under this bill, future mine operations would pay an 8 percent royalty and existing mines would pay a 4 percent royalty. It would also end the "patenting" practice, allows claimholders to purchase public lands where their mines are located for as little as $2.50 an acre.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has identified hardrock mining as a leading source of toxic pollution in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the EPA, it will cost approximately $50 billion to clean up abandoned hardrock mines, and 40 percent of the headwaters of western watersheds have been polluted by mining.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mining practices have changed since 1872. Today, mining companies often dig holes over one mile in diameter and 1,000 feet deep, using cyanide and other chemicals to extract metals from tons of low-grade ore. These chemicals and the toxic metals they dissolve from the rocks can leach into water sources. Acid mine drainage filled with heavy metals is difficult and expensive to clean up. When spills occur, taxpayers bear the brunt of cleaning them up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The royalties collected under this bill would be directed towards much needed environmental protection measures. Two-thirds of the royalties, fees, and penalties paid by hardrock mining companies would help to mitigate the harmful effects of past mining activities on water supplies and public health. The funds would be used to restore land, water, and wildlife harmed by mining, and to clean up the abandoned mines and toxic waste materials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The remaining one-third would go to assist states and localities impacted by hardrock mining to provide public facilities and services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2662">H.R. 2662</bill> also expands the types of land on which mining would be prohibited to include wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, and certain roadless areas in national forests, adding necessary protections to some of our national treasures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> brings much needed reforms to hardrock mining operations. The bill ends priority status for mining interests, and ensures that mining on public lands takes place in a manner that protects taxpayers and the environment, and I urge its support.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, following 2 days of committee consideration of the bill during which the committee debated 25 amendments, we continued a dialogue with several members of the committee, both sides of the aisle, Democrat and Republican, in order to further perfect the underlying legislation and to keep the fairness of the process open.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This manager's amendment is a result of those deliberations. In summary, the manager's amendment would, one, clarify that valid existing rights associated with existing mining claims would be protected under the act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number two, this amendment clarifies that, in addition to paying a 4 percent royalty, existing operations would still need to come into compliance with the act within 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number three, this amendment clarifies that the claim maintenance and location fees currently allotted to the administration of the mining claims will continue to be so allotted with the balance going to cleanup of abandoned hardrock mines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, in this amendment, as requested by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), user fees assessed by the BLM to process mining permit applications would be used for administration of the mining law program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The manager's amendment would further limit the purview of section 504 citizen suits to permits issued pursuant to title III of the act as suggested by Mr. Cannon of Utah.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The manager's amendment would clarify that nothing under this act will affect the sovereign immunity of any Indian tribe.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment is actually quite simple. It deletes the new definition for "undue degradation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> changes the current standard contained in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act from unnecessary and undue degradation to just undue degradation, which is defined to mean "irreparable harm to significant, cultural or environmental resources on public lands that cannot be effectively managed."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new definition is dramatically different from the existing regulatory definition of unnecessary and undue. Under current law, unnecessary and undue degradation means impacts greater than those that would normally be expected from an activity being accomplished in compliance with current standards and regulations based on sound practices, including use of the best reasonable and available technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The definition now in this <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> reinstates a Clinton-era change to regulations governing hardrock mining on Federal lands that was rescinded in 2001 after a very open, public review of the Clinton regulatory scheme.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Clinton-era definition for undue degradation was specifically rejected. It was rejected by the Bureau of Land Management Environmental Impact Statement that reviewed the Clinton regulations and declared it to be too vague and too subjective. The BLM EIS process included scoping for the EIS, which included a formal 81-day comment period and 19 public meetings in 12 cities; placing the proposed regulations, draft EIS and related documents on BLM's Internet Web site; and finally, two public  comment periods for the EIS, including 29 public hearings in 16 cities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After this very thorough process, the BLM found that this definition was, essentially, an opportunity for the Secretary of the Interior to deny a mining company an operating permit, even though the proposed mining operation  would be in full compliance with Federal and State laws govern hardrock mining. This is what some people refer to as the "mine veto."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The BLM found that the requirement to avoid irreparable harm to significant resources values which cannot be effectively mitigated has the greatest potential for affecting mining activities, both large and small. In some cases this provision could preclude operations altogether.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Clinton-era regulations were spearheaded by Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt and Solicitor John Leshy. During the Elko, Nevada, field hearings this past summer, majority leader, Senator HARRY REID, made the following statements regarding the outcome of the changes to the regulation: "Bruce Babbitt is a friend of mine. But for the mining he was awful." That's what HARRY REID said this year. It was in one of the hearings that we've referred to today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>"He had people there that--John Leshy ..... He tried to destroy mining. Really ..... he didn't believe in it. He wanted it gone. And that created uncertainty."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new definition for "undue regulation" is a lawyer's dream creating ambiguity fighting about whether we mine instead of how we mine. We don't need more litigation; we need more common sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This definition brings so much uncertainty to the regulatory process that we will see a further decline in investments and the exploration and development of our domestic mineral resources. And there is a potential when mines that are in production today transition into the new system outlined in title III or are in the permitting process to expand their operations that those operations could be denied a license to operate, leaving billions of dollars of infrastructure idle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can guarantee you that the coal industry, which has played such an important role in the economic well-being of the chairman's district, would not be able to operate under this definition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This definition alone will drive more companies offshore, making us more dependent on foreign sources of mineral resources and adversely impacting the economic vitality of mining-dependent communities in the West, like Silver City, New Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Keep in mind that the mining industry pays the highest nonsupervisory wages in the country. It provides benefits including health care, retirement programs, college scholarships, and assistance for employees and their families. Tourism and recreation jobs cannot compete with these high-paying family-wage jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge you to vote "yes" on this amendment, keeping the current standard, protecting American jobs and access to domestic mineral resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman from West Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would agree with my friend from New Mexico in only the first three words of the statement he just made, and that being it's a simple amendment. Yes, it's a simple amendment. It helps liberate, it eradicates, it eliminates, it erases, it simply guts the fundamental environmental safeguard of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have struggled for many years to find a statutory standard by which hardrock mining on Federal lands must comply with. This bill states that mining must prevent "undue degradation of public lands and resources." That term is defined as "irreparable harm to significant scientific, cultural, or environmental resources on public lands that cannot be effectively mitigated."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me stress the use of the words "that cannot be effectively mitigated." It is common practice in this country to mitigate developments, whether it be the construction of a highway, a dam, or a mine. But under this bill, if a mining operation could not be configured under any circumstance to effectively mitigate irreparable harm to save the water supply of a major city, then the Interior Department would have the ability to just say no. The gentleman from New Mexico's amendment would  strike the definition in the bill of this term. The amendment would continue a 19th century view that was fashioned in an era when there was no major metropolises in the West. The amendment harkens back to an era that no longer exists. This is a defining moment. This is what we are talking about in the overall thrust of the pending legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill, we will continue to have mining on Federal lands. I personally believe it will flourish. But the bad actors in the industry, the minority, and I will be the first to readily admit it is a minority, will no longer be allowed on the stage. The responsible industries should be against this amendment because they are the ones, as I said earlier, that want some certainty to their planning decisions so that they can make the investment decisions necessary to run a responsible mining  operation with the jobs attendant thereto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I therefore would urge opposition to the gentleman from New Mexico's amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to offer an amendment to this much-needed legislation. My amendment clarifies that river watersheds will be eligible to receive some of the cleanup funding that will be generated by this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Watersheds are crucial for the health of our Nation. They help move our goods, preserve our ecosystems, and protect our communities from flooding. Managing our Nation's watersheds in a holistic and responsible way is essential. If we do not protect and maintain them, we jeopardize critical parts of our environment that support commerce and recreation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In arid States like California, Nevada, and Utah, river watersheds are even more important to economic and environmental health. Watersheds support a variety of agricultural, economic, and recreational activities. In my home State of California, for example, the Sacramento River Watershed forms the basis for fertile farmland, thriving urban areas, and outdoor recreational opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, many watersheds are located near active and abandoned mines. Years ago rivers represented great economic opportunity. Rivers are where many precious metals are located. But the drive for these minerals has left a negative environmental legacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Nevada, more than 7,000 tons of mercury were deposited into the Carson River Watershed during the quest for silver. In the California foothills, tens of thousands of mines were dug for the gold that was discovered in the watershed running through my district. More than 4,000 of these abandoned mines pose environmental hazards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must protect these river watersheds that are vital to our way of life. That is why my amendment is needed. It does not change the underlying structure of this very good bill. But it does make it crystal clear that cleaning up watersheds affected by mining is a priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, mining impacts water all across the West. Our river watersheds feel the effects of mining to a great degree. Addressing these impacts requires a comprehensive management approach. My amendment is crafted, and offered today, with this in mind. And it acknowledges that good watershed management is a critical tool of maintaining our natural resource. It recognizes that by protecting watersheds, we are investing in a public good that all Americans use. And it ensures that this public  good will be maintained for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all Members to support my amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding and for offering this very important amendment that does improve and enhance our ability to restore abandoned mine lands and waters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The underlying legislation would establish an abandoned hardrock mining reclamation fund which would be financed by the royalties that were imposed on operations under the mining law of 1872. The gentlewoman's amendment makes it clear that remedial activities could be done on a river watershed basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I commend her for offering this amendment, and we are truly ready to accept it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, speaking today, we are wondering if the bill that we are talking about has an effect in all districts. And I would say we have a chart here which shows that rising commodity prices are driving people to stealing copper, stealing our minerals, and it is occurring in many of the districts, including the gentlewoman's district in California, where there has been a prosecution. And we have got 80 of these. We have a chart, but I won't show that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The concept of cleaning up abandoned mine lands is one that we are deeply encouraged by and associate ourselves with, and especially as it affects watersheds. Nowhere are watersheds more important than in the West, and especially New Mexico, because so little water exists throughout the West. Anything we can do to clean up watersheds in general, but, again, the abandoned mine lands is something that we are very supportive of from this side. It relates back to the comments that we have made in  our opening statement that I don't think that on the core issues that we are very far apart at all, that we could have gotten where we all would agree with the bill. So we would accept the amendment and congratulate the gentlewoman for her work on this in abandoned mine lands and watersheds in general.</paragraph>

  <chair>The text of the amendment is as follows:</chair>
  <chair>Amendment No. 4 offered by Mr. Heller of Nevada:</chair>
  <chair> In section 411(b), amend the matter preceding paragraph (1) to read as follows:</chair>
  <chair> (b) Allocation.--Of the amounts deposited into the Hardrock Reclamation Account, 50 percent shall be allocated by the Secretary among the States within the boundaries of which occurs production of locatable minerals from mining claims located under the general mining laws and maintained in compliance with this Act, or mineral concentrates or products derived from locatable minerals from mining claims located under the general mining laws and maintained in compliance with this Act, as  the case may be, in proportion to the amount of such production in each such State. Expenditures of the remainder of such amounts shall reflect the following priorities in the order stated:&lt;p&gt;</chair>
  <chair> Pursuant to House Resolution 780, the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Heller) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nevada.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412218" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, more hardrock mining occurs in my district than in any other State; therefore, the remediation of abandoned mine lands is very important to my constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of us are aware, abandoned mine lands are the unfortunate legacy of the irresponsible mining practices of the past. Fortunately, mining operations today are held accountable for their practices. So with bad practices of the past ended, we have an opportunity to focus on cleaning up the abandoned mine lands. And the amendment I am offering will do just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment will direct half of the revenues deposited in the hardrock reclamation fund to States for the purposes of abandoned mine land remediation, while preserving the Federal Government's ability to fund the national priorities in the bill. My amendment allows the Federal Government to distribute half of the funds as it sees fit. The other half of the funds would go proportionately to States where production is occurring to fund in-place, successful AML programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In multiple committee hearings, we heard that States currently do a great job of remediating abandoned mine land sites. They often are only limited by their available resources to conduct remediation projects. To give some of you perspective of how effective State programs are, Nevada has identified more than 20,000 AML sites in need of remediation and is still in the process, of course, of identifying more. The good news is that to date we have secured more than 9,000 of those sites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Likewise, in Colorado it is estimated that there are about 23,000 abandoned mines. More than 6,000 have been made safe by the State Division of Reclamation Mining and Safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So in an effort to get money on the ground to remediate abandoned land mine sites quickly and efficiently, a portion of these funds needs to be dedicated to States where production is occurring. Given that many States have already prioritized their AML needs, we should get funding to them as directly as possible, as quickly as possible. This amendment will expedite the cleanup process that we all want.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment bolsters the ability of States to continue their good work on the ground while providing a way to remediate historic hardrock sites in States where mineral production will not generate sufficient funds to deal with current abandoned mine land issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge support of the Heller amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, during debate in committee over this legislation, the gentleman from Nevada conducted himself in a manner which I highly commend. He offered amendments that were aimed at addressing the concerns and interests of his State and his district. And, frankly, I recognize he has the most at stake here, representing Nevada, the largest gold-producing State in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman offered two amendments. The one he is offering today was one of those amendments. In committee, I could not accept it because we had no discussions on it prior to its appearing as an amendment. But we did offer to continue to work with the gentleman from Nevada, as we have done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And after having some time to consider the subject matter of his amendment, I am going to accept it, and I would urge my colleagues to do likewise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would allocate 50 percent of the revenues received from the proposed new abandoned hardrock reclamation fund back to the States where those revenues were generated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>There is precedent for this arrangement in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund established for coal back in  1977 which so vitally affects my State. The other 50 percent of the revenues would be used by the Federal Government for national priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, in conclusion, I say to the gentleman from Nevada, you are looking out for your State. I appreciate that; I commend you for it. And I appreciate the manner in which you have approached this overall issue of mining law reform, and I accept your amendment.</paragraph>

  <chair>Amendment No. 6 offered by Mr. Cannon:</chair>
  <chair> Strike section 517.&lt;p&gt;</chair>
  <chair> Pursuant to House Resolution 780, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Cannon) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to begin by thanking the chairman of the full committee. We have worked on this bill or ideas surrounding this bill for, I think, over 10 years now. It is now on the floor. It has been done with grace and with dignity, and I appreciate the gentleman's approach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We come from very, very different districts. About two-thirds of my State is public lands, very little of the gentleman's State is public lands. And so we differ. We have a different approach, and I think that's very appropriate, just as the gentleman pointed out with regard to Mr. Heller and his district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have differences, and we come at these things differently. And in that context, I hope that the gentleman will consider accepting my amendment. On the other hand, our colleagues here today will recognize the importance of this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would strike section 517 of the bill before us. The amendment is necessary so common consumer products remain affordable. If section 517 is not stricken, Americans will see an increase in the cost of everyday products, such as glass, ceramics, paper, plastics, rubber, detergents, insulation, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, to name just a few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 517 deals with common varieties of industrial minerals. Unfortunately, this provision would put industrial minerals that are clearly identifiable as unique, and thus "locatable," under the mining law into this category despite existing law that has labeled them as locatable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Industrial minerals have been classified as locatable since 1872 under the General Mining Law. These minerals were never intended to be included in the Mineral Materials Act. The Mineral Materials Act was designed to deal with bulk sales of common deposits of sand and gravel. Moving industrial minerals into the Mineral Materials Act would make it impossible for these operations to continue to extract these unique industrial minerals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Industrial minerals should not be treated the same as rocks and sand and gravel that can be loaded in the back of a truck and hauled away. Yet section 517 would do just that. Under the Mineral Materials Act, minerals are disposed of by non-competitive processes for small quantities and by competitive bidding contracts for terms of 10 years or less. However, it can take 50 years to extract industrial minerals, and the investment for doing that tends to be in the 50 to $100 million range.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Competitive bidding contracts of a maximum term of 10 years will remove any incentive by industrial mineral companies to research and explore for new reserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After spending resources to discover reserves; and if also awarded the contract, the company will not be guaranteed the necessary time to actually extract the minerals and develop the resource. This will force our mining industry to move overseas and will result in the loss of thousands of high-paying jobs here in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only will section 517 create uncertainty for mine operators but will also impose a significant administrative burden on BLM.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from West Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate very much the gentleman from Utah's concern and his deep involvement in this legislation. What worries me with his pending amendment is the myriad of unintended consequences that may occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1947, and again in 1955, Congress took out from the operation of the Mining Law of 1872 mineral materials such as sand, stone, and gravel on Federal lands and provided that they could be sold under contracts. However, a loophole was inserted into the law. Under this loophole, if the sand, stone, or gravel was an uncommon variety, it would remain under the Mining Law of 1872.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, determining just what an "uncommon variety" is has since cost the American taxpayers countless millions of dollars in litigation. The legislation before us today eliminates the distinction and confusion. And we would make all of these mineral materials available through sales contracts. The gentleman's amendment would strike that provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In essence, the gentleman's amendment would continue to allow uncommon varieties of mineral materials to be claimed under the Mining Law as revised by this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm not sure the sponsor of the amendment realizes what the result would be for these uncommon variety mining claims to be then subject to the bill's royalty regime and the bill's environmental standards. As such, if we adopted the gentleman's amendment, an 8 percent royalty would then be slapped on any future production from these uncommon variety claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Be that as it may, I oppose this amendment. First, the American people receive a return from the disposition of mineral materials through the sales contract. Moreover, this distinction between uncommon and common varieties of sand, stone, and gravel is nothing but a scam. I well recall, as does the gentleman from Oregon, our colleague, PETER DEFAZIO, the "great sand scam" at the Oregon Dunes National Recreational Area. I conducted a subcommittee hearing in Oregon on this issue. One person  plastered mining claims over 780 areas of the recreation area where the hearing was held claiming the sand was uncommon. As I recall, his contention was that it had unique silica virtues for making glass. He then demanded $11 million from the Federal Government to buy him out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I well recall the "stone-washed jeans scam," where this guy located mining claims for pumice in a wild scenic river in New Mexico. He claimed that the pumice was an uncommon variety because you could produce stone-washed jeans with it. Give me a break. I think the gentleman gets the idea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And just because some special interests lobbyists got this loophole inserted into Federal law in 1955 does not mean it should be condoned today. I view it as a scam, a rip-off. I urge defeat of this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remainder of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the first place, I believe that what the gentleman was just talking about was metallurgical-grade silica and different from the summary we've just had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think, though, in response to his main argument, it is an amazing comment on the bulk of this bill that the producers of industrial minerals prefer to be under the new regime than to be under the uncertainty that would be created. They need certainty to develop minerals over 50 years instead of 10 years. And so while the gentleman's comment is well taken, I would suggest to him that the industry actually prefers my amendment, regardless of the fact that it incurs these other burdens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, finally, I would take exception to the reference of this as a scam. The fact that we don't have tax dollars coming to the Treasury based upon reserves that are being developed does not mean that Americans aren't better off because they have lower prices for paper, which requires kaolin, a locatable clay that makes paper cheaper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is a matter of policy; it is not a matter of scams. And I urge my colleagues to recognize that, to recognize the burdens that this would create on very common products that we produce with these locatable minerals, and to vote in support of my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time and merely would restate what I said earlier about the millions of dollars in litigation that the American people have shelled out to determine just what uncommon varieties are. And, therefore, the gentleman from Utah's amendment would merely continue allowing, without royalties being paid and allow being mined for free, these uncommon varieties of sand, stone and gravel being mined from Federal lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would urge opposition to the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 1/2  minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to start talking about first what this amendment is not. First of all, it is not a cost increase. CBO has said there will be no cost associated with it. Also, it is not an effort to reestablish the Bureau of Mines at the Department of the Interior. Congress abolished the Bureau of Mines before I came to Congress; but a key component of that agency, the Minerals Information Team, was entrusted to the U.S. Geological Service. Unfortunately, USGS has not recognized the  critical nature of this program or the importance of the information the MIT produces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, at USGS, the Mineral Commodity Function is five steps below the USGS Director, and eight steps below the Secretary of the Interior. In contrast, the Energy Information Administrator is only one step below the Secretary of Energy. At DOI Minerals Information, it's just about like being a janitor; you have about that much access into the system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Resource Origin and Commodity Knowledge, ROCK, Act, takes the mineral commodity information function away from USGS and creates and funds a stand-alone agency using DOI resources. It restores and funds the function Congress sought to retain and protect in 1995.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="TITLE __--MINERAL COMMODITY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that the gentleman continues to push. We had it offered in full committee markup, had debate on it at that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it was offered in committee, I advised him that it did not belong in this bill and perhaps should be considered as a stand-alone piece of legislation after the subject of a hearing. We have not conducted that hearing yet on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said in committee, I do remind my colleagues on the other side that when Newt Gingrich and Company issued their Contract with America, one of its tenets was to reduce the Federal bureaucracy. What the Republican majority ultimately achieved in this regard was the elimination of two Federal entities, the ICC, the Interstate Commerce Commission, which was then recreated as the STB within the Transportation Department. And the other Federal entity that the then-Republican majority eliminated  was the Bureau of Mines at the Interior Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in a stunning reversal, the Bureau of Mines would essentially be recreated under the guise of a Mineral Commodity Information Agency, I guess you would call that, MCIA. It would enlarge the bureaucracy and increase Federal spending. I repeat, it would enlarge the Federal bureaucracy and increase spending. I keep looking around for my colleague from Arizona (Mr. Flake). Where are you when we need you?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman's amendment would authorize $30 million a year for this new bureaucracy that the then-Republican majority eliminated when they ran the Congress. This new bureaucracy would have an associated administrator; it would have four assistant administrators; there would be an external affairs office, a public affairs office, even an international affairs office, and who knows how many other offices here and there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The budget, financial, human resources offices, the human capital management office, the professional development office, the contract management office, yadda, yadda, yadda, I think you get the picture. So this is a whole lot of bureaucracy that would be created based on a proposal that never had a hearing and that was rejected by the Republicans when they were in the majority.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support the Pearce amendment to <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>, which establishes the Minerals Commodity Information Administration at the Department of the Interior. The MIT collects and disseminates data on virtually every commercially important nonfuel mineral commodity produced worldwide, information that is critical to businesses, the government, and importantly, the Department of Defense to help manage the National Defense Stockpile. Due to the importance of the data,  the MIT should be an independent agency reporting to the Secretary of the Interior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This information from the MIT is critical to the effective use of the Nation's natural resources and for accurate forecasting. Without a reliable source of worldwide commodity information, the U.S. would be blind to any impending supply shortages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most fundamental functions of the Federal Government is to provide for the common defense. There is an undeniable nexus between our Nation's minerals policy and national security policy. Currently, 24 strategic and critical military materials are imported at no less than 40 percent from our foreign trading partners. For example, the U.S. imports 54 percent of its magnesium. This mineral is vitally important in constructing airplanes and missiles. Requiring our military to import the  strategic and critical minerals it needs from foreign nations, some of whom may be hostile, puts our military at a significant disadvantage and weakens our ability to adequately sustain our national defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when defense needs are determined in terms of capabilities-based planning instead of threat-based planning, an accurate assessment of our Nation's minerals is vitally important. The Pearce ROCK Act amendment is a means to that end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the Pearce ROCK Act amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it is interesting that we did get into the discussion of the CBO here and the additional cost that would be implemented under this act. The underlying act actually has been scored at $441 million by CBO over 5 years, almost $100 million a year. I share the gentleman's concern about increasing expenditures, increasing bureaucracy, and would again request that we reconsider the  entire thing. But at the moment I would suggest  that we do want to realize that two recent National Research Council reports stress that we are increasingly dependent on foreign nations for minerals critical to America and that we need to have an independent agency as called for in this ROCK Act amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment will establish the independent Minerals Commodity Information Administration and the Minerals Information Team to collect, analyze and disseminate information on the domestic and international supply of and demand for minerals, materials critical to the U.S. economy, and our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. businesses operate in a global economy, and virtually every manufacturing sector from aviation to textiles relies on the unbiased, comprehensive data reported by the MIT. This information enables American companies to use domestic resources effectively, forecast worldwide market conditions, develop informed strategic business plans, and respond effectively to short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in minerals prices, and I urge the adoption of the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on Interior appropriations and my fellow classmate, Mr. Dicks of Washington.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400109" topic="TITLE __--MINERAL COMMODITY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. This amendment is unnecessary. The country does not need a new bureau to create minerals information. The current situation in which the U.S. Geologic Survey administers the minerals information works perfectly fine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee, I have examined the Bush administration proposals to eliminate funding for the USGS minerals information function. Even during these difficult budgetary times, our subcommittee has appreciated the important function of the minerals assessment team at the USGS and refused the administration's recommendation to eliminate its funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Pearce amendment would nearly double the size of the new agency. It would create a new bureaucracy with at least 300 staff and a yearly cost of $30 million or more. So please join me in rejecting this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the former chairman of the Interior subcommittee, Mr. Regula from Ohio.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400334" topic="TITLE __--MINERAL COMMODITY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this. When I was chairman of the committee, we eliminated the Bureau of Mines in 1995. Nobody missed it. The functions are carried on by the USGS very effectively. It is just one of those things that is not needed. I think it would be a big mistake to put it back in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment provides for 200 employees out of USGS. Why take them away from where they are doing a good job? The mining programs have worked very effectively since 1995, the time at which we eliminated this. It saves about $100 million. I think it would be a big mistake to put another, put it back in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that the Members will join me in opposing this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Pearce amendment. This amendment would simply re-create an agency that was dismantled in 1995. As Chairman of the House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee at that time, I worked to close the Bureau of Mines which the proposed amendment's agency resembles, in an effort to balance the budget through smaller, more effective government. With its closure, almost $100 million, or 66%, of the Bureau of Mines' 1995 programs ceased. However, certain critical  minerals information activities moved to the US Geological Survey. This meant we receive the needed information on our mineral resources using far less money than in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since taking over the minerals information functions, the USGS has done an excellent job of producing critical minerals information and in fact has broadened the role of the minerals information group by providing vital statistics and insight to help commerce, industry, and security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The USGS is the sole provider of mineral resource assessments and information in the federal government. To fragment this program once again by creating a new bureaucracy in government would not improve its functionality or serve American taxpayers' interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment does not create anything new that is substantive. The only thing the amendment will create is a title of new agency, move some people around, and employ 100 new bureaucrats in administrative positions. Why do we need 100 administrative positions to oversee 200 scientists who were already working effectively at the USGS?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, the amendment proposes a $30 million budget, which is more than double the current funding for this function. In our current budget climate, it makes no sense to add this new agency burden to government when the work this agency is proposed to do is already being done at the USGS effectively, with less expense to the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment will only fracture our current system of attaining knowledge on our country's mineral resources, create a new bureaucracy and waste tax dollars. I urge a "no" vote on the amendment.</paragraph>

  <chair> Members are advised 1 minute is left in this vote.</chair>
  <chair/>
  <chair>So the amendment was rejected.</chair>
  <chair>The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.</chair>
  <chair> The question is on the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair> Under the rule, the Committee rises.</chair>
  <chair>Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Ross) having assumed the chair, Mr. Serrano, Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (<bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill>) to modify the requirements applicable to locatable minerals on public domain lands, consistent with the principles of self-initiation of mining claims, and for other purposes, pursuant to House Resolution 780, he reported  the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted by the Committee of the Whole.</chair>
  <chair> Under the rule, the previous question is ordered.</chair>
  <chair>Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amendment.</chair>
  <chair>The amendment was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair> The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.</chair>
  <chair>The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time.</chair>
  <chair> Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400313" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>I am opposed to the bill in its current form.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Clerk will report the motion to recommit.</chair>
  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>  Mr. Pearce moves to recommit the bill <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> to the Committee on Natural Resources with instructions to report the same back to the House promptly with the following amendments:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At the end of section 102(a) add the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) LIMITATION ON APPLICATION.--No royalty under this section shall apply to any mineral that is used in the manufacture of any technology used for the production of solar energy or nuclear energy.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At the end of the bill add the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. __. EFFECTIVE DATE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act shall take effect on the date the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the heads of other appropriate Federal agencies, certifies that nothing in this Act would result in a loss of jobs in the United States associated with mining-related activities to which this Act applies.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. PEARCE (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the motion be considered read.</narrative>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Mexico?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <chair> The gentleman from New Mexico is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400313" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is an honest, straightforward and commonsense motion which should be accepted unanimously. Its acceptance would help restore America's confidence in this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This motion addresses two issues Americans expect their elected representatives to address. Americans want more alternative energy sources so we are not dependent on people who hate us for our energy supplies. Americans want to make sure that their government does not take actions which destroy American jobs. The supporters of this bill promise it will not hurt jobs. My motion guarantees it will not hurt jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They constantly promise that they want more clean energy to reduce our dependence on foreign supplies. My motion guarantees this clean energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much of the controversy about this bill is about the importance of minerals and the jobs they support. Some say the bill will cost the kind of jobs this country needs and leave us begging other nations for the minerals necessary to produce cleaner energy right here at home. Others argue that it doesn't. My amendment resolves that question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If adopted, my motion would ensure that the government is not taxing American production of important minerals used for solar power and nuclear power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That makes sense. The government should not be taxing our efforts to produce more clean domestic energy. The last thing that we need to do is become more dependent on others for energy sources we plan to use to get off of dangerous foreign energy supplies. That's just common sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, my motion applies the "first, do no harm" standard to this bill as it relates to jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have said here today, minerals mining jobs are the best nonsupervisory jobs available in the country today, according to government reports. This motion says that the government has to certify that this bill will not cost American jobs before it goes into effect. That's the least this country can do for working Americans, make sure that we don't lose their jobs because of our actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The supporters of this bill say it will not cost jobs. This gives them a chance to vote to ensure that it doesn't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have heard today on the House floor that this is a work in progress, that <bill type="h" number="2262">H.R. 2262</bill> is a work in progress. I am saying that the Nation's security depends on our good work today and we should not submit a work in progress to the other Chamber. I hope that the supporters of this bill will take this olive branch and guarantee jobs to Americans, not just make more promises to Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard promises this bill won't hurt jobs; this motion guarantees it. We hear promises about more clean energy to reduce our dependence on foreign supplies. This motion guarantees it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My motion turns a promise into a legal guarantee. I urge its adoption by all Members of the Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from West Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is the day after Halloween and I recognize fully there are still tricks in the air, and this is another trick by the minority in this body. The amendment says report back to the House promptly. I am pretty sure that every Member of this body recognizes what the word "promptly" means. It is an amendment by the minority to substantially delay, if not outright kill, the pending legislation. So Members are well aware of this trick, and I urge defeat of this attempt  to thwart passage by the House today of bipartisan legislation that has broad support at the local, State and Federal level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Mr. Speaker, the effect of this motion would also be to reduce the amount of royalties owed the American people under this bill, under the guise of advocating nuclear energy for that matter, and I see no relationship here. I urge defeat of this motion which would reduce the amount of royalties that would come in to the American taxpayers under this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now to the segment about loss of jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Due to changes in demands today, it's every Member of this body's knowledge that we may see a decline in the hardrock mining industry and the demand for jobs because of the technology, because of the technologies that are coming online. There's not a one of us who is against those technologies. In many cases, they're cleaner. In many cases, they're safer and they're healthier for our workforce. But that technology does displace man and woman power. It's a fact of our economic realities today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the gentleman's motion to recommit is based on unfounded premises, scare tactics, and tricks that we should not adopt; and I would urge defeat of the gentleman's motion to recommit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit.</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <chair> The question is on the motion to recommit.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.</paragraph>
