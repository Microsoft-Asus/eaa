  <narrative>CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL IMPROVEMENTS -- (Senate - September 27, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12280">S12280</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>As the chairman knows, many rural hospitals are facing significant financial pressure and are finding it increasingly difficult to operate under the Medicare prospective payment system. In response, the chairman and I have worked closely to support our rural facilities and established the Critical Access Hospital Program in 1997. This program was designed to help small, rural facilities remain financially viable in the face of inadequate Medicare reimbursement, and it has been tremendously  beneficial to maintaining access to hospital care across North Dakota and other rural states.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I share my colleague's support for the Critical Access Hospital Program. Like North Dakota, Montana struggles to maintain sufficient access to hospital care. The Critical Access Hospital Program has been an important component in ensuring that our hospitals can remain open and continue to serve Medicare beneficiaries.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Despite the successes that have been achieved under the Critical Access Hospital Program, changes made as part of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 have harmed the ability of certain critical hospitals, such as St. Joseph's Hospital in Dickinson, ND, to become critical access hospitals. It is imperative that flexibility be reinstated in the program to allow States to deem hospitals as necessary providers and, therefore, eligible for critical access hospital status. I have spoken  with you about this issue in the past and am pleased that you are willing to consider this issue during consideration of a Medicare package later in the year.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I strongly support reinstating the ability of States to deem necessary providers to be critical access hospitals. The Critical Access Hospital Program has helped ensure that the doors stay open at many hospitals in rural America. Without this program, many Medicare beneficiaries in my State would have to drive hours to receive health care. I think it is important to give States flexibility to deem necessary providers as critical access hospitals and not rely on a one-size-fits-all  definition. If we don't address this issue, I am worried that one of our hospitals in western North Dakota, St. Joseph's Hospital, may not be able to survive. I appreciate Chairman Baucus' commitment to work with us to address this issue and to consider modifications to the Critical Access Hospital Program that would allow St. Joseph's Hospital in Dickinson, ND, to participate.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>I applaud my colleague's efforts on this issue and assure you that I am committed to working with you to enact modifications and improvements to the Critical Access Hospital Program in Medicare legislation later this year that will assist hospitals like St. Joseph's.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague for his commitment and look forward to working with you to craft a reasonable solution that benefits St. Joseph's.</paragraph>
