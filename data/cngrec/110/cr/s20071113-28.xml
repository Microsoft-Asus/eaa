    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise today to proudly recognize the accomplishments of the Gardner-Webb University "Runnin' Bulldogs" of Boiling Springs, NC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Originally chartered on December 2, 1905, Gardner-Webb has long been known for its excellent academic and athletic programs, which is a testament to its accomplished faculty. As a thriving regional university, Gardner-Webb offers eight unique degree programs on its beautiful 200 acre campus. Led by University President Dr. Frank Bonner, its approximately 4,000 students are some of the brightest minds their generation has to offer and I look forward to witnessing their rise through the ranks in  the coming years ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On November 7, 2007, in a truly David versus Goliath story, the Gardner-Webb "Runnin' Bulldogs" basketball team visited storied Rupp Arena to challenge the Kentucky Wildcats, one of college basketball's most successful programs, boasting seven National Championships. Late into the evening it became official, the Bulldogs shocked college basketball by upsetting the #20 ranked Wildcats. The Bulldogs entered the locker room at halftime with an 11 point lead and never looked back. With a final  score of 84-68, head coach Rick Scruggs, team staff and the determined players masterfully executed their game plan which will forever be remembered as one the greatest upsets in college basketball history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join the university's many loyal supporters, alumni and fans everywhere in commending not only the Bulldogs' outstanding accomplishment last night, but the entire Gardner-Webb community for cultivating an environment that believes that accomplishing anything is not only plausible, but as highlighted last night, is possible.</paragraph>
