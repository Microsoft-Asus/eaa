    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to say that my colleague from New Jersey, Mr. Andrews, is the Speaker this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this afternoon to congratulate the Rutgers Scarlet Knights on their recent victory over Kansas State in the Texas Bowl. Last Thursday the Scarlet Knights cruised to a 37-10 victory over the Kansas State Wildcats, capping their memorable season with the first bowl win in school history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Running back Ray Rice led the winning effort with 170 yards rushing and a touchdown. Wide receiver Tim Brown scored two touchdowns, which, combined with Rutgers' stifling defense, was more than enough to put away Kansas State. The defense held Kansas State under 200 total yards and did not allow an offensive touchdown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coach Greg Schiano led his team to an 11-win season this year for only the second time in Rutgers' history. In his five short years since becoming head coach at Rutgers, Coach Schiano has turned the program around from a 2-9  record in the basement of the Big East to an elite football program near the top of the BCS standings. And Coach Schiano has received national recognition as the coach of the year, as well as Big East honors as coach of the year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, also deserving of recognition are university president Richard McCormick and Rutgers athletic director Bob Mulcahy. During their tenure, Rutgers athletics, particularly the football program, has reached a high standard athletically and academically. The American Football Coaches Association has recognized Rutgers football for a high level of academic achievement among student athletes. Additionally, Rutgers student athletes have played a large role in the community by becoming involved  with toy drives, hospital visits, and blood drives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the hard work, dedication, and teamwork exhibited by the Rutgers football program embodies the highest traditions of scholar athletes and serves as an inspiration to all New Jerseyans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And once again I would like to congratulate the entire Rutgers athletic program and the university as a whole for this remarkable achievement. I look forward to cheering them to even greater success in the future "in that noisy college town on the banks of the old Raritan."</paragraph>
