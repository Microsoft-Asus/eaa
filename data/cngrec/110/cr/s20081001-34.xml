  <narrative>NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH -- (Senate - October 01, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10303">S10303</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in honor of National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month. Senator Coleman and I understand that the Senate passed our resolution recognizing National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month. I stand before you today and challenge every Member of Congress to take this opportunity to be the voice for children who do not necessarily have someone to speak for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chair of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I strongly believe that "there is no such thing as an unwanted child, just unfound families." The Hague Convention recognizes "that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding." Unfortunately, not all children have a family of their own, but through adoption our children have the opportunity to find their "forever  family."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly half of all Americans have been touched by adoption, and last year more than 4,200 children became members of permanent loving families through adoption celebrations that were held in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. I commend every State for its efforts, but we still have miles to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Between 2002 and 2007, approximately 4.8 million children were serviced by the U.S. foster care system, and only 310,000 of them were adopted by "forever families." Children in foster care are some of the most vulnerable members of our society, and we must do everything in our power to make sure they have the necessary tools to live a normal healthy life. As Members of Congress we have taken a stance in helping children move from foster care to permanent, adoptive homes by passing the Fostering  Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008. However, National Adoption Day gives us the chance to experience firsthand the joys that adoption brings to the lives of our children and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush has recognized the importance of adoption to children and our Nation. That is why he declares November to be National Adoption Month. This year National Adoption Day occurs on November 15 as a part of National Adoption Month. National Adoption Day is an event to raise awareness of the 129,000 children in foster care who are waiting for permanent families. Since the first National Adoption Day in 2000, nearly 20,000 children have joined "forever families" on this special day.  This year we hope to have events in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want you to picture what happens on this fall day, children running, laughing, and playing with their new parent. Think about a girl or boy planning their special outfit and joyously awaiting the family celebration. Imagine the excitement welling up inside of a child as she looks into her new parent's eyes and knows she is finally part of a family. She will never dread the sound of a car coming to take her away again or wonder where she will lay her head or which school she will be moved to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now picture the other dramatically different reality. There are approximately 513,000 current foster care children in the United States, and 114,000 of them are waiting for adoption. Since 1987, the number of children in foster care has nearly doubled, and the average time a child remains in foster care has lengthened to nearly 3 years. Each year, approximately 24,000 children in foster care will age out of the system without ever being placed with a permanent family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a survey by the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, many potential adoptive parents have considered foster care adoption, but "a majority of Americans hold misperceptions about the foster care adoption process and the children who are eligible for adoption." For example, "two-thirds of those considering foster care adoption are unnecessarily concerned that biological parents can return to claim their children and nearly half of all Americans mistakenly believe that foster care  adoption is expensive, when in reality adopting from foster care is without substantial cost."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most foster children entered into State custody because their parents were either unable or unwilling to care for them. Not only are children separated from parents, but in many cases, siblings are separated when they are placed in foster care. Over half the children in foster care are 10 years of age or older and have more difficulty being adopted. These children are just waiting to flourish with the right parent's guidance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Louisiana there are 4,541 children in foster care and 1,162 of them are waiting to be adopted. I would like to share with you how foster care and adoption has affected some of our children in Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ian is 15 years old and first entered foster care at the age of 5 due to physical abuse and lack of supervision by his mother. Ian's mother surrendered her parental rights, and he and his three sisters were placed for adoption. Ian's younger sisters were adopted by their foster parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In November 2006, Ian was placed in a specialized foster home after completing a facility program. This family has worked very closely with Ian in learning to trust others, making appropriate choices, on becoming part of a family unit, and being able to "attach" to others in preparation of an adoptive family. Ian is working very hard to adjust to a "traditional family lifestyle" and is progressing well in this family setting. Ian states he wants an adoptive family that says, "You are our  child and we will not turn you away."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ian is very personable and is looking for acceptance in life. He is polite, affectionate, and very adventurous. Ian enjoys playing basketball, riding bikes, reading Harry Potter books, and playing video games. Numerous recruitment efforts for an adoptive home have been made since Ian was placed in the specialized foster home, but an adoptive family has not been found to date. One of the greatest barriers to adoption is a lack of resources of prospective adoptive families willing to adopt older  children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Ian is still desperately searching for someone to love and care for him, Christopher, through all of his struggles, has found that sense of permanency. Christopher is 12 years old and first entered foster care at the age of 2 months. He was subject to abuse by his biological father that resulted in a skull fracture, subdural hematoma, bruises, bites, and burns. Christopher had many developmental delays and problematic behaviors requiring placement in specialized foster homes. Christopher's  removal was requested by several foster placements because of behavioral issues. In June 2006, a foster parent who had provided respite for Christopher was asked to consider the fostering of Christopher as the child had formed a very strong bond to this foster parent and her children during his respite visits. Upon placement in this home, drastic improvements were</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One day while the adoption social worker was visiting with Christopher and his foster mother, Christopher said he wanted to change his name to "Kantrell." The social worker responded "Kantrell (and Christopher's last name), that does sound nice." Christopher replied no, "Kantrell" and the last name of his foster mother. The  social worker stated that she immediately noted a glistening in the eye of the foster mother who replied, "Is that really  what you want, Christopher?" Christopher responded that was very much his desire. The adoption of Christopher was finalized in January 2008 with Christopher changing his name to "Kantrell." Kantrell has continued to thrive in his adoptive home and is a delight to all who know him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, 79,000 children and youth who exit foster care leave without a permanent home or belonging to a family. I could stand here every day for the next month and talk about each child who needs to be adopted out of foster care. The bottom line is that each of these children, from 1 day old to 22 years old, needs permanency. They all need a loving, nurturing family that will help them to grow, bring out their unique personalities, and transform them into confident and happy adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On National Adoption Day, I have faith that we can be the catalyst to securing a permanent loving family for every child. The miracle of adoption cannot be explained, but the loving parents who are holding their children for the first time today are living examples of how dreams can be realized. As an adoptive mother myself, I find that words cannot adequately explain the miracle of adoption. I can only take a moment to offer my most humble thanks, gratitude, and appreciation to all those across  the Nation who have given their Saturday to help find waiting children safe and loving homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us continue to remember that when National Adoption Month and Day end there are still thousands of children who need that sense of permanency. I challenge Congress to make these children their first priority and not another statistic to be studied. Please join us in supporting National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month by participating in events held across the country celebrating this most joyous, hopeful act.</paragraph>
