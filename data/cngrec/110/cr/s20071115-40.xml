  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Carolyn Downs is the outgoing executive director of The Banquet in Sioux Falls, SD who is stepping down after 20 years of service to the Sioux Falls community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Banquet, an ecumenical ministry, has been providing free meals to the Sioux Falls community since 1985. In the past year, The Banquet served 137,000 guests. Since she started her work with The Banquet in 1988, Carolyn has organized thousands of volunteers and served countless meals. Carolyn learned from her mother at a young age that sharing meals was a way that people show their love to others. The secret to her success is her ability to put herself in other people's shoes. Carolyn encourages  her volunteers to not only provide food to those that come to her center, but also to express compassion and understanding through conversation and interaction. Carolyn's love for others is reflected in her perpetual smile and her giving spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>South Dakota's communities are held together by dedicated individuals like Carolyn Downs who commit their time and energy to helping those around them. She is truly an example of what it means to serve others. Her leadership and dedication to The Banquet will be greatly missed. It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Carolyn on a successful career and wish her the best on her retirement.</paragraph>
