  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, one of the things in the bill we passed last night that was put in by the Democrats was $40 million to take care of some of the emergency issues in Kansas. That was the right thing to do. This legislation we are passing now will extend tax relief to residents and businesses of Greensburg, KS, as a result of that tornado. I have spoken to Senator Roberts about this. He worked on this hard and I am glad we were able to satisfy his requests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read the third time, and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, that any statements relating thereto be printed in the Record, and that the bill now be held at the desk pending action by the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
