    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, within the last month, the American people have seen just how misplaced President Bush's priorities are when it comes to addressing the needs of hardworking Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this month, the President vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have provided 10 million children private health insurance through the SCHIP program. The bill cost an additional $35 billion over the next 5 years, and would have allowed us to receive 4 million more uninsured children. Instead, the President suggested a mere $5 billion increase, which would lead to more than 800,000 children losing their health insurance coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Contrast that with the President's announcement last week that he was requesting an additional $189 billion in emergency funds over the next year for the war in Iraq, which was $42 billion higher than originally thought.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, most Americans, Senators and Governors have caught on to the President's misplaced priorities. But Republicans here in the House continue to blindly follow this President. And just as they refused to join us last week in standing by these 10 million kids, House Republicans will most likely sign off on the President's war funding request without ever asking a single question.</paragraph>
