  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, along with the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, I have introduced the America COMPETES, Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science, Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is the result of a truly bipartisan effort. Two years ago, Senators BINGAMAN and ALEXANDER asked the National Academies to make recommendations on the steps we should take as a nation to maintain our competitive advantage. The result was the Augustine Report, "Rising Above the Gathering Storm," which provided four primary recommendations:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the United States needs to dramatically improve K-12 science and mathematics education in order to increase our talent pool. Second, we must sustain and strengthen our Nation's traditional commitment to long-term basic research. Third, we must make the United States the most attractive place to study and perform research. And fourth, we need to provide incentives for innovation and long-term investment so that the United States is the premier place to innovate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report warned that the Nation's traditional advantages "are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength," and that "decisive action is needed now."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America has faced this challenge before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1957, when the Soviets launched Sputnik, it caused great panic and concern about our ability to maintain our technological superiority. We responded to these threats quickly. The following year, Congress passed the National Defense Education Act, to keep the United States ahead of the Soviets through increased investment in math and science education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We trained a whole new generation of engineers and scientists, and thus ensured our preeminence in technology and innovation for a generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That fact is, Federal investment in the basic sciences and research has long been a critical component of America's competitive dominance globally. In fact, some economists have estimated that about half of the country's economic growth since World War II has been the result of technological innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, however, our position of dominance has been lost. We are challenged by emerging countries like India and China, where national investment in basic research and subject areas such as math and science continues to grow at a far greater pace than here in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Augustine panel cited many examples, but some of the statistics are striking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consider that in 2005, more than 600,000 engineers graduated from institutions of higher education in China, compared to 350,000 in India and only 70,000 in the United States. China's population is more than three times that of the United States, yet they graduate more than eight times the number of engineers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report also found that American 12th graders performed below the international average for 21 countries on general knowledge in math and science. Another study cited in the report had American 15-year-olds ranked 24th out of 40 countries on a math assessment. In my home State of Nevada, the situation is equally alarming, with our students ranked 43rd in the Nation on a 2005 math assessment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And even though technological giants like Microsoft, Apple, and Intel are American companies, the report indicates that the United States is now a net importer of high technology products--a shift from the early 1990s, when we had a $54 billion surplus in high-tech exports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As other countries become more competitive, it is clear we must refocus our energies on enhancing the Federal commitment to funding basic research and education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must preserve the competitive edge of the United States in science  and technology by getting kids motivated to study math and science. To do this, we need to provide more training for math and science teachers, increase the number of students taking advanced placement courses, offer grants to establish high schools that specialize in math and science, and provide scholarships and fellowships for future scientists and engineers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation we are introducing today addresses some of these concerns. It is, in effect, a downpayment, a modest first step to ensuring that America retains its competitive edge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to thank Senators BINGAMAN and ALEXANDER for authorizing the Academies Study. This study, along with a number of recent reports and books--among them, Tom Friedman's "The World is Flat," which I know that many of my colleagues have read--brought a much-needed sense of urgency to this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of these provisions were included in the Protecting America's Competitive Edge Act, or PACE, which Senators BINGAMAN and DOMENICI introduced in the last Congress, and I was pleased to cosponsor that important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to recognize the hard work of a number of my colleagues, Senators INOUYE, STEVENS, KENNEDY, ENZI, LIEBERMAN, ENSIGN, MIKULSKI, HUTCHISON, and Senator Nelson of Florida, who have been instrumental in crafting this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation that we are introducing will double the Federal investment for the National Science Foundation over the next 4 years, and for the Office of Science at the Department of Energy over the next decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America COMPETES will create a DARPA-modeled research project at the Department of Energy and increase investment for basic research at NASA and other science-related Federal agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill provides grants to States in order to better align elementary and secondary school curriculum with the knowledge and skills needed for the global economy. Nevada is already doing something similar, with our State P-16 Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation will strengthen our math and science teaching workforce by recruiting and training teachers to teach in high-need schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America COMPETES will expand the important Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate, IB, programs by increasing the number of math, science, and foreign languages AP and IB courses, and preparing more teachers to teach these challenging courses. This is essential for States such as Nevada, where only 6 percent of 12th graders took the AP calculus exam and only 7 percent took an AP science exam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill will help develop an infrastructure for innovation by establishing a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness to promote innovation and competitiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, this legislation will help improve math instruction at the elementary and middle school level, through Math Now grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If signed into law, our bill will do many of the things that the Augustine Report recommended, but the truth is, in years to come, we will have even more to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though we make new and significant investments in research, we still must address our tax structure and make sure that we do as much as possible to encourage investment in research and development. We should start by finally making the R&amp;D tax credit permanent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must also do more in education. This bill strengthens educational opportunities in science, technology, engineering, math, and critical foreign languages, but this is just a first step. For example, we must take a very hard look at our high schools. As Bill Gates has often said, our high schools were designed for a 20th century economy and often do not address the needs of the 21st century workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should also realize that unless our most basic commitments to America's students are met--by properly funding title I and No Child Left Behind and making a college education accessible and affordable--these efforts alone cannot prepare our students for the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Senator McConnell and I began the 110th Congress by promising a new spirit of bipartisanship. Of course we have had our differences on some issues, but I hope that, in jointly introducing this important legislation, we send a signal that investing in America's future is not a partisan issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The America COMPETES Act is an important first step in maintaining this Nation's competitive advantage, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that we follow through on the investments we are making in this legislation.</paragraph>
