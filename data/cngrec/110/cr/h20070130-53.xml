    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Rule XI clause 2, I am submitting the Committee on the Budget's rules for the 110th Congress. The rules were adopted during our Committee's organizational meeting, which was held January 18, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rules of Procedure of the Committee on the Budget, January 18, 2007</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rule 1--Applicability of House Rules</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Except as otherwise specified herein, the Rules of the House are the rules of the committee so far as applicable, except that a motion to recess from day to day is a motion of high privilege.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rule 2--Regular meetings</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(a) The regular meeting day of the committee shall be the second Wednesday of each month at 11 a.m., while the House is in session.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(b) The chairman is authorized to dispense with a regular meeting when the chairman determines there is no business to be considered by the committee. The chairman shall give written notice to that effect to each member of the committee as far in advance of the regular meeting day as the circumstances permit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(c) Regular meetings shall be canceled when they conflict with meetings of either party's caucus or conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rule 3--Additional and special meetings</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Rule 4--Open business meetings</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(a) Each meeting for the transaction of committee business, including the markup of measures, shall be open to the public except when the committee, in open session and with a quorum present, determines by roll call vote that all or part of the remainder of the meeting on that day shall be closed to the public in accordance with House Rule XI, clause 2(g)(1).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(b) No person other than members of the committee and such congressional staff and departmental representatives as the committee may authorize shall be present at any business or markup session which has been closed to the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rule 5--Quorums</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A majority of the committee shall constitute a quorum. No business shall be transacted and no measure or recommendation shall be reported unless a quorum is actually present.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rule 6--Recognition</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Any member, when recognized by the chairman, may address the committee on any bill, motion, or other matter under consideration before the committee. The time of such member shall be limited to 5 minutes until all members present have been afforded an opportunity to comment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rule 7--Consideration of business</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Measures or matters may be placed before the committee, for its consideration, by the chairman or by a majority vote of the members of the committee, a quorum being present.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rule 8--Availability of legislation</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee shall consider no bill, joint resolution, or concurrent resolution unless copies of the measure have been made available to all committee members at least [4] 6 hours prior to the time at which such measure is to be considered. When considering concurrent resolutions on the budget, this requirement shall be satisfied by making available copies of the complete chairman's mark (or such material as will provide the basis for committee consideration). The provisions of this  rule may be suspended with the concurrence of the chairman and ranking minority member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rule 9--Procedure for consideration of budget resolution</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(a) It shall be the policy of the committee that the starting point for any deliberations on a concurrent resolution on the budget should be the estimated or actual levels for the fiscal year preceding the budget year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(b) In the consideration of a concurrent resolution on the budget, the committee shall first proceed, unless otherwise determined by the committee, to consider budget aggregates, functional categories, and other appropriate matters on a tentative basis, with the document before the committee open to amendment. Subsequent amendments may be offered to aggregates, functional categories, or other appropriate matters, which have already been amended in their entirety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(c) Following adoption of the aggregates, functional categories, and other matters, the text of a concurrent resolution on the budget incorporating such aggregates, functional categories, and other appropriate matters shall be considered for amendment and a final vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rule 10--Roll call votes</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A roll call of the members may be had upon the request of at least one-fifth of those present. In the apparent absence of a quorum, a roll call may be had on the request of any member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rule 11--Announcement of hearings</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairman shall make a public announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of any committee hearing at least 1 week before the hearing, beginning with the day in which the announcement is made and ending the day preceding the scheduled hearing  unless the chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking minority member, or the committee by majority vote with a quorum present for the transaction of business, determines there is good cause to begin the hearing sooner, in which case the chairman shall make the announcement at the earliest possible date.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rule 12--Open hearings</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(a) Each hearing conducted by the committee or any of its task forces shall be open to the public except when the committee or task force, in open session and with a quorum present, determines by roll call vote that all or part of the remainder of that hearing on that day shall be closed to the public because disclosure of testimony, evidence, or other matters to be considered would endanger the national security, or would compromise sensitive law enforcement information, or would tend to defame,  degrade, or incriminate any person, or would violate any law or rule of the House of Representatives. The committee or task forces may by the same procedure vote to close one subsequent day of hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(b) For the purposes of House Rule XI, clause 2(g)(2), the task forces of the committee are considered to be subcommittees.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>(1) First, the chairman and the ranking minority member shall be recognized;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) Next, the members present at the time the hearing is called to order shall be recognized in order of seniority; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(3) Finally, members not present at the time the hearing is called to order may be recognized in the order of their arrival at the hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recognizing members to question witnesses, the chairman may take into consideration the ratio of majority members to minority members and the number of majority and minority members present and shall apportion the recognition for questioning in such a manner as not to disadvantage the members of the majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rule 15--Subpoenas and oaths</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(a) In accordance with House Rule XI, clause 2(m) subpoenas authorized by a majority of the committee may be issued over the  signature of the chairman or of any member of the committee designated by him, and may be served by any person designated by the chairman or such member.</paragraph>
