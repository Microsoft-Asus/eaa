    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to Army Specialist Jeremy R. Gullett from Greenup, Kentucky, a dedicated soldier who lost his life on May 7, 2008, in the Sabari District of Afghanistan. He was assigned to the 4th Battalion, 320th Field Artillery Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division based out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to his mother, Cheryl, Jeremy had dreamed of joining the service since he was 6 years old. While attending Greenup County High School, Specialist Gullett was a member of the school's Junior ROTC program. He joined the Army in 2003, shortly after graduating from high school. Jeremy was a model citizen. Not only did he serve our country abroad, he was also a volunteer fireman; a loving father to his two young daughters, Kaye and Katie; and a dedicated husband to his wife, Janeth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, as we celebrate the life and accomplishments of this exceptional Kentuckian, my thoughts and prayers are with Jeremy Gullett's family and friends. We are all deeply indebted to Specialist Gullett for his service and sacrifice.</paragraph>
