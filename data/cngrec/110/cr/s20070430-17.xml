    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise to speak to the Senate because there is another thing the executive branch of Government has done today; that is, the Secretary of the Interior has announced a vast new expansion of drilling off of the continental United States. The one area proposed for lease sale for oil and gas production and drilling that is acceptable is the area we negotiated in the legislation we passed last year, which is lease sale 181 in the central Gulf of Mexico and part  of the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Members will recall that this has been a 6-year struggle, of which this Senator from Florida actually had to engage in a filibuster in 2005 to protect the interests of my State, as well as the interests of the U.S. military, and finally prevailed in that protection in 2006, when we agreed to an area that could be drilled, but it was kept far from the coast of Florida and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what the Secretary of the Interior has proposed is some exploration in those areas we approved last year, which was approved with this Senator's consent because we protected the financial, economic interests of Florida, keeping the oil drilling away from our precious, sugary, white-sand beaches, which spawn a $52 billion-a-year tourism industry, keeping it away from the bays and estuaries that  are so necessary to the ongoing marine life, and at the same time protecting the U.S. military and its interests to have its weapons tested so they are ready to go in case they are needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposal today also includes other areas off the continental United States; with the concurrence of Virginia, 50 miles off the shore of Virginia. I would think the States of South Carolina and North Carolina ought to have something to say about that. I would think the State of Delaware or the State of New Jersey ought to have something to say about that because the wind and wave action doesn't just keep a potential oil spill right off of Virginia, even if Virginia wanted that drilling 50  miles off of its coast. There is a major tourism industry built on the beauty of those beaches in North Carolina as well as the beaches of Delaware and New Jersey, not to even speak of the beaches of South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other part the Secretary of the Interior is proposing is four different areas off the coast of Alaska. We certainly remember the concerns, which were valid concerns, as a result of the Exxon Valdez disaster decades ago. But my argument against this proposal by the Secretary of the Interior goes far beyond those valid concerns I have just mentioned. It goes to the heart of the matter of national security and protection of the national economy; that is, we have an economy and a defense posture  that puts us in the position today of being reliant on foreign oil to the tune of 60 percent of our daily consumption of oil coming from foreign shores in places such as the Persian Gulf region, Nigeria, and Venezuela, three parts of the world that are not</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then someone would say: If that is true, why not drill for more oil?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the first place, as to this drilling off Alaska, the oil wouldn't be ready for another 10 years. The economic crisis is today. The national security crisis is today. The United States has 3 percent of the world's oil reserves, but the United States consumes 25 percent of the world's oil production. It doesn't take a mathematical genius to figure out that you can't drill your way out of the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That brings me to the crux of my argument. The present policy of the administration is to drill, drill, drill. We simply have to change that policy. We have to go to alternative fuels. We have to go to increased mileage standards on our vehicles; otherwise, we can never get out of this problem of dependence on foreign oil, all the time  making ourselves easily seduced by arguments of drill, drill, drill, with oil companies having record profits and with,  of course, the people, our folks, all of us, having to endure $3 a gallon gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an ideal world, you could say that you could do both--yes, in an ideal world. But this isn't an ideal world. This is a world in which the policy has always been drill, drill, drill. We have to break that policy. We have to start on things just like this proposal which is another part of the drill strategy of this administration. Only then are we going to protect our national security and only then are we going to protect our national economy by shifting to other fuels and to vehicles of which  we easily have the technology now to get 40 miles per gallon on the fleet average instead of 27 miles per gallon on the fleet average.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You can imagine, if we can do that, instead of relying on a plan to drill for more oil that is not going to become available for another 10 years--if we will change the policy right now, which will have an immediate effect, starting tomorrow, on our consumption of oil--then, only then, will America start to move on a path truly toward energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
