    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would propound a unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous consent that during the period of morning business, Senators be permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, and that the following Senators be recognized in this order: Senators HUTCHISON, INHOFE, CHAMBLISS, KENNEDY, and Leahy; and following that, Senator Shelby be recognized for up to 45 minutes; and that after this sequence, the sides alternate where appropriate.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this is, as I am sure the Senator from Texas knows, somewhat unusual, and not the way this is normally done. Normally we would alternate from side to side. I have actually discussed this with some of the Senators on her side. However, in the interests of at least having some idea of where we are going to go so we won't have to do the procedural fix of having Senators stand up and propound speeches that are put in the form of a question  as we have been seeing here for some time, I will not object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered. The unanimous consent request is granted.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, my remarks will not last 10 minutes, and I hope the Senator from Georgia will be able to have his time in turn, because he has been waiting for quite a long time.</paragraph>
