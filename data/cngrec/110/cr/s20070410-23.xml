  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to Robert D. Evans, who retired on February 28, after 35 years of distinguished service with the American Bar Association, including services as director of the ABA's Governmental Affairs Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Vermont, Bob received his B.A. from Yale University in 1966 and his law degree from the University of Michigan in 1969. He began his legal career at the Chicago firm known today as Sachnoff &amp; Weaver, practicing corporate and commercial law. When an opportunity to work on public policy issues arose, he joined the ABA Chicago staff in 1972, and soon found himself working in the ABA's Washington, DC, office. Since 1982, Bob has served as director of the Governmental Affairs Office, providing  strong leadership on many issues, including judicial independence, tax reform, the PATRIOT Act, and numerous anticrime and antiterrorism bills. Perhaps what people will remember most is Bob's career-long effort to guarantee access to justice for all through the development and preservation of the Legal Services Corporation, which funds local legal aid programs to help low-income individuals and families deal with basic legal problems that affect day-to-day living.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob is listed in "Who's Who in America" and "Who's Who in American Law." He has received numerous awards and commendations for his dedicated and tireless work in seeking equal justice for America's poor, including recognition from the National Legal Aid and Defender Association and the National Clients Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob has also made outstanding contributions to Washington-area communities. He has served Washington Grove, MD, as mayor and town council member, and currently sits on the Washington Grove Planning Commission. Bob has also chaired the Associations Division of the National Capital Area United Way Campaign, and has helped to raise millions of dollars for DC area charities to support those in need. He also was president of Project Northstar, a homeless children's tutoring program for homeless children  in the District of Columbia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With his dedication to the rule of law, his professionalism, his expertise and his unfailing good humor, Bob has fulfilled the highest ideals and goals of the legal profession. He has improved the administration of justice, and brought greater access to legal representation and American justice for all persons, regardless of their economic or social condition. Bob will be greatly missed. I join his many colleagues and friends in wishing Bob, his wife Kathie, and their daughter Sarah much happiness  in the years to come.</paragraph>
