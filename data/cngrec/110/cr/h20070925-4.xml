  <narrative>HONORING STEVE MOORE -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10759]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400645" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of a fellow Oklahoman, Steve Moore, who unexpectedly passed away on Saturday, September 22, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Steve was a great person and a great Oklahoman. Many in the Oklahoma community and around the Nation knew Steve as the CEO of OG&amp;E, but he was much, much more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, Steve's leadership paved the way for OG&amp;E to be recognized by Forbes magazine on its list of the Nation's best managed companies. Additionally, as approximately 750,000 OG&amp;E customers know, the company received numerous awards for customer satisfaction in emergency response under Steve's guidance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, during his 61 years, Steve managed not only to be the leader of Oklahoma's largest utility provider, but also a civic leader throughout the State. Few may know that Steve is the past chairman of the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce, and he served on the boards of the Oklahoma City Public Schools Foundation, Allied Arts, the State Fair, the United Way, the Edison Electric Institute, and the foundations of both the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma City University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think his list of civic activities, along with the State and national recognition given to OG&amp;E, showed that Steve Moore truly cared for his employees, for his customers, and, above all else, his fellow Oklahomans. It was this home-grown Okie compassion that will make the Sayre-born and Altus-raised son of Oklahoma missed by us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With these thoughts, Oklahomans around the State send their condolences to Steve's wife Nancy, his daughter, Lisa, his son, Scott, and his mother, Melda. Steve will be missed, but not forgotten.</paragraph>
