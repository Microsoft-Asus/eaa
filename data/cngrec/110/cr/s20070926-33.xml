  <narrative>THE DREAM ACT -- (Senate - September 26, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12136">S12136</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I was disappointed earlier this year when the  comprehensive immigration reform was not passed. On two separate occasions, as Republicans filibustered the legislation to its legislative death, we tried to move this to conference on comprehensive immigration reform, and it was filibustered both times. We had knowledge there were not enough Republican votes to pass it. The last time we got 12 Republican Senators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Part of that vital legislation was something we called the DREAM Act. This legislation's advocates have moved very hard. The primary advocate for this, and its primary sponsor, has been Senator RICHARD DURBIN of Illinois. He has worked tirelessly in his efforts to pass the DREAM Act. He has spoken within the Senate on many occasions, both here on the Senate floor, in the committee, and in press conferences we have had regarding immigration. I have never known Senator Durbin to  feel more strongly about anything than this, and we have been together for 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The DREAM Act recognizes that children should not be penalized for the actions of their parents. Many of these youth come to America very young. Many do not even remember their country of origin because they were too young when they left, nor do they speak the language of their home country. They think of themselves as Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of these children are so desperate to be able to go to school. Only children who come to the United States when they were 15 years old or younger and have been in the United States for at least 5 years can apply under the DREAM Act. They would have to meet certain criteria, including earning a high school diploma, demonstrated good moral character, and passing criminal and security clearances. That is what the DREAM Act requires. To qualify for permanent status you must go to college or  serve in the military for at least 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have met star students in Nevada, for lack of a better description, who had qualified for the DREAM Act. With it their future is limitless. Without it, their future is very limited. Their future is diminished, of course, if they can't go to school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the children this bill would help are extremely talented and have graduated in the top of their classes, yet cannot go to a State school. What a waste it is to make it more difficult for them to go to college or prohibit them from getting jobs where they could be making meaningful contributions to their communities and to our country. What good does it do anybody to prevent these young people from having a future? Is gang membership better? Is a minimum wage job for life better? Is a  life of crime better?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hoped we would be able to offer this legislation as an amendment to the pending legislation, the Defense Authorization Act, but we have been unable to do that. Enacting the DREAM Act will give more of our children an opportunity to succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Durbin and all who care about this matter should know that we will move to proceed to this matter before we leave here. I am going to do my utmost to do it by November 16. This is important legislation. We have a commitment to the young people to do this. It was part of the comprehensive immigration reform. It was a key part of comprehensive immigration reform. It was there that Senator Durbin began talking about it--some would think incessantly--but he talked about  it all the time, and he still feels strongly about this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I send a message to him tonight and all who care about this legislation, we are going to try to move to this legislation. We should have been able to do it on this bill. We are going to be unable to do it, but we are going to move forward on this legislation as I have outlined.</paragraph>
