  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>At present, Congress has before it, for consideration in committee, an Iraq funding bill which will keep the war going perhaps through the end of President Bush's term. It would order the privatization of Iraq's oil and open the door for the President to order an attack on Iran without congressional authorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats were brought to power not to spread war, but to stop it. The administration took us into war for oil. We should not be confirming that purpose by promoting privatization in the Iraq funding bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President desires to attack Iran without Congress asserting its constitutional authority. We should be asserting our constitutional authority to restrain another administration abuse of power.</paragraph>
