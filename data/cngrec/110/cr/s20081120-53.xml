    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor the board of directors and dedicated staff at the Washington Pavilion of Arts and Science in Sioux Falls, SD, on their accreditation by the American Associate of Museums. Since its creation in 1999, the Washington Pavilion of Arts and Science has provided education and inspiration to those of all ages in the Sioux Falls region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Washington Pavilion has three main program areas, all designed to make art and science a part of everyday life. The Kirby Science Discovery Center introduces visitors to things like hands-on archeology, weather, and space shuttles. The Wells Fargo CineDome Theatre allows viewers to travel the universe or witness nature in vivid detail. Lastly, the Visual Arts Center brings art to all generations with its six galleries and changing exhibits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to congratulate the Washington Pavilion of Arts and Science on reaching this milestone in their mission, and for their service to the community. Once again, I commend the individuals involved in this enterprise and am pleased to see them publicly honored with accreditation by the American Association of Museums.</paragraph>
