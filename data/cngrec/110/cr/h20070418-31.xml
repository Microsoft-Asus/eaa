  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the new Democratic Congress has made good on its promise to change the direction of the war in Iraq while providing critical funding for our veterans and our wounded soldiers. Yet, the President is still threatening to veto a final conference report when it comes out of this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why would the President veto a bill that requires Iraqis to take control of their country by meeting key security, political and economic benchmarks the President himself established?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why would he veto a bill that provides greater protections for our troops and our veterans than what was originally requested by the President?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The supplemental provides 1.7 billion more for military health care, which includes facility upgrades at Walter Reed and other hospitals that require renovation. We also provide an additional $1.7 billion for veterans health care to ensure that they have access to quality care. The veterans I have met with from New Jersey have told me that this is one of their top priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been opposed to the preemptive war in Iraq from the beginning because the administration has failed to explore diplomatic solutions. And therefore the stay-the-course strategy is wrong. And I hope that the President will sign and not veto this bill.</paragraph>
