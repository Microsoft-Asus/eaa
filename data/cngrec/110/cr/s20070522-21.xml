  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 18, 2007, in Greenville, SC, Sean Kennedy was beaten by an unnamed man which resulted in his death. Kennedy, a gay man, was punched in the face and knocked to the ground where he sustained injuries to his head. Kennedy died of his injuries later that night at a local hospital. The attacker was later brought into custody and charged with murder. Because Kennedy was attacked while leaving a gay bar and the attacker used anti-gay epithets, the Greenville County Sheriff turned the case over  to the FBI for investigation as a hate crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew Shepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
