    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I want to pay tribute to Mike Kurle, who retired earlier this year as the longtime manager of the West River/Lyman-Jones Rural Water System. I have worked with Mike for nearly my entire congressional career and value his friendship, professionalism, and typical South Dakota steadfastness. I know that Mike and his wife Marlene are looking forward to being able to travel a little more and spend some time with their children who are scattered across the country.  However, I want to take a few minutes and explain to the Senate the role Mike played in bringing reliable supplies of drinking water to the towns and ranches of western South Dakota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As manager of West River/Lyman-Jones, Mike guided one of the four local project sponsors that constitute the Mni Wiconi Rural Water System--one of the largest Federal drinking water projects constructed in the last 30 years. Mike managed the project practically from the beginning and over the past 16 years has always put first the interests of the communities, ranches, and farms served by the system. On Mike's watch, 2,200 rural customers now receive reliable drinking water piped hundreds of  miles from the Missouri River. The towns of Philip, Presho, Kennebec, Murdo, White River and, very soon, Kadoka benefit from the Mni Wiconi project. Mike has overseen Federal transfers in excess of $55 million and constantly delivered good value and on-time performance from contractors. Most importantly, Mike is someone that could be trusted and he worked well with the system's three other sponsors--the Oglala Sioux Tribe, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, and Rosebud Sioux Tribe. The project is a collaboration between the area's American Indian tribes, the Federal Government, and the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, in closing, I want to thank Mike Kurle for his service and professionalism and most of all friendship and guidance over these many years. I know that Mike can't stay away from the West River/Lyman-Jones office forever but hope that he can enjoy moving at a slower pace knowing that future generations will be well served by his efforts.</paragraph>
