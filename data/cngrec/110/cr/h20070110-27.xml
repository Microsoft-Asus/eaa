  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, we will have the  chance to grant relief to millions of Americans toiling under an unjust minimum wage, but later this week we will also have the opportunity to grant relief to the millions of Americans who are suffering from debilitating and life-threatening diseases by passing the bipartisan Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Connecticut, I was proud to have overseen passage of the Nation's first law investing State funds in life-saving stem cell research. But our $100 million success story in Connecticut was a bittersweet one, since our effort was made necessary only by the Federal Government's failure to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will be even prouder to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle this week to support legislation that will buttress the hopes of millions of Americans with the tangible support and resources of their Federal Government, and I hope that this unprecedented show of support here in the people's House will give our President cause to reconsider his unfounded and unpopular decision to oppose this life-saving initiative.</paragraph>
