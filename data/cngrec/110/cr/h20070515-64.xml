  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Maggie Rodriguez, who recently accepted the lead anchor role on the nationally televised CBS "Saturday Early Show." Maggie has been covering south Florida with CBS's local affiliate, CBS 4, for 7 years. As a news anchor on the 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts, Maggie has delivered news to millions of people in my community on a regular basis since the year 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maggie is a product of south Florida who has distinguished herself in her chosen field of journalism. She attended Our Lady of Lourdes Academy, located in the heart of my congressional district. In 1991, she graduated from the University of Miami, my alma mater. As a fellow south Floridian, I am very proud to honor Maggie on her many achievements. She is moving to New York, but she will always be welcomed in her hometown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her husband, Michael, is the general manager of Telemundo's local affiliate in Miami. I am sure that Maggie will continue to spend significant time down home in south Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since beginning her career with Univision in 1991, Maggie's warm personality, coupled with her strong work  ethic, has made her very successful. She has delivered breaking news on a number of notable stories throughout the years. She has extensive experience covering natural disasters. Before taking over as news anchor on CBS 4, Maggie reported on earthquakes and mudslides with KABC in Los Angeles. With CBS 4, she has, unfortunately, covered numerous  hurricanes. Like any newscaster in south Florida, the long hurricane season every year has kept Maggie busy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When hurricanes hit our region, local newscasters play a pivotal role in helping residents prepare and recover from hurricane damage. Oftentimes, they provide around-the-clock coverage. Most recently, Maggie did outstanding work reporting on Hurricane Wilma which severely impacted our region in the year 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maggie will be moving to New York where she spent significant time reporting for CBS 4 in the aftermath of 9/11. Maggie was noticed by CBS executives for her coverage of this year's Super Bowl in Miami. This led to guest appearances on the "Saturday Early Show" and eventually to a full-time position on this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maggie is a great role model also for Hispanic girls in our community. She received the Young Hispanic Leadership Award from the Hispanic Heritage Council for both her professional accomplishments as well as her efforts in strong community service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a local news anchor, she has become an active member of our community, lending a helping hand to those in need. Her professional portfolio has garnered several awards, including six Emmys, along with two Edward R. Murrow awards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She will be missed by so many people who tune in every afternoon and evening to watch her on CBS 4. However, we look forward to watching her on Saturday mornings nationwide. Her pleasant personality makes her ideal for this new role.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I congratulate Maggie Rodriguez as she begins this new chapter in her life. She truly deserves the recognition she has received, and now millions of Americans across the country will have the opportunity to watch her on Saturday morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Godspeed, Maggie.</paragraph>
