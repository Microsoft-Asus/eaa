    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about a gentleman who was Army Specialist Ervin Caradine, Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Caradine would have been 36 years old today if he had lived. He was from my hometown of Memphis, Tennessee where we have lost nine veterans. He joined the Army to provide a better life for his family. He had graduated from Fairley High School and worked his way up to being a manager at the Steak-Out Restaurant in Memphis. He had a wife and he had four children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Three years ago to this day, Army Specialist Ervin Caradine, Jr., died. He was in a convoy in Baghdad that was hit by an IED 3 years ago. Three days before his death, he called his wife and she said there was a change in his voice. He said, "It's getting worse over here, it's not getting better."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, nearly 3,000 more soldiers have died. Army Specialist Ervin Caradine, Jr., said something 3 years and 3 days ago that is still true: It's getting worse over here, it's not better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's not have more deaths.</paragraph>
