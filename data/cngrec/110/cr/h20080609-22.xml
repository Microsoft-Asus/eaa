  </narrative>
  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF EB-5 REGIONAL CENTER PILOT PROGRAM. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Section 610(b) of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993 (8 U.S.C. 1153 note) is amended by striking "shall set aside" and all that follows through "eligible for admission" and inserting "shall set aside 3,000 visas annually for 20 years to include such aliens as are eligible for admission". &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. </narrative>
  <narrative> It is the sense of the Congress that, to the extent practicable, qualifying investments under section 610 of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993 (8 U.S.C. 1153 note) should be made in targeted employment areas (as defined in section 203(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(5)(B)(ii))), including rural areas (areas other than an area  within a metropolitan  statistical area or within the outer boundary of any city or town having a population of 20,000 or more (based on the most recent decennial census of the United States)) and high unemployment areas (areas that have experienced unemployment of at least 150 percent of the national average rate).&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we move to extend an immigration program proven to promote investment and to create jobs for American workers. <bill type="h" number="5569">H.R. 5569</bill> would extend the EB-5 regional center pilot program for 5 years. Unless Congress acts, the regional center pilot program will sunset on September 30 of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress created the fifth employment-based preference, known as EB-5, immigrant visa category in 1990 for immigrant investors. To qualify for a green card, the investor must prove that the investment is in a commercial enterprise that will benefit the United States economy and create at least 10 full-time jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In general, investors must invest at least $1 million. However, that amount can be reduced to $500,000 if the investment is made in a rural or high unemployment area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Approximately 10,000 visas have been made available in the EB-5 green card category each year. But the category has been underutilized ever since it came into being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To help further encourage this program, Congress created a temporary pilot program in 1993. The regional center pilot program allocates 3,000 visas each year, out of the 10,000 available, for EB-5 investors who invest in so-called designated regional centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the immigrant investor pilot program, an applicant seeking EB-5 status must make the qualifying investment within an approved regional center. The requirement to create at least 10 new jobs, however, can be met by showing that, as a result of the new enterprise, such jobs will be created either directly or indirectly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The regional center program is vital for our economy. For example, in fiscal year 2007, a total of 806 investors and family members immigrated to the United States in the EB-5 category.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not very many people, but even at that level, the EB-5 immigrant investor program is expected this year to generate an annual rate of $1 billion in aggregate immigrant investment, creating more than 20,000 new direct and indirect jobs. Usage of the program is expanding as new regional centers get approved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The regional center program helps get investment money to some of the Nation's poorest communities, creating jobs and revitalizing communities. In Vermont's poorest county, for example, a regional center investment has put $17.5 million into a ski resort at Jay Peak. This project is expected to create close to 2,000 jobs in the area, according to the New York Times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that Congress reauthorize the EB-5 regional center program. The pilot program has been renewed several times, and is currently due to expire, as I said earlier, on September 30 of this year. This bill would extend the EB-5 regional center pilot program for 5 years, until September 30, 2013.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the subcommittee reviewed this bill, we had a discussion about looking at the level of investment and also the possibility of including venture capital-driven investments, where it's really the patents and ideas that are creating the jobs. We hope to be able to work with the minority to further pursue those ideas at a subsequent date. It should not deter us from proceeding today with this program that has proven to be valuable to our Nation by creating jobs for Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400220" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the investor visa program is designed to attract entrepreneurial talent and capital to the United States and to create American jobs. Under this program, permanent resident visas are available each year to aliens who establish a new business in the United States and invest between $500,000 and $1 million in the business and eventually create at least 10 full-time jobs for American workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once the Department of Homeland Security approves an alien business plan, the alien receives conditional permanent residence status. Two years later, the Department of Homeland Security determines whether the above requirements have, in fact, been met. If they have, the alien receives permanent residence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To further encourage economic development, back in 1993, Congress created a temporary pilot program that set aside 3,000 investor visas each year for aliens who invested at least $500,000 in designated regional centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A regional center is any economic unit, public or private, which is involved with the promotion of economic growth, including increased export sales or improved regional productivity or job creation or increased domestic or capital investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, a regional center shall have jurisdiction over a limited geographical area which shall be described in the proposal and consistent with the purpose of concentrating pooled investment in defined economic zones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The establishment of a regional center may be based on jobs that will be created, directly or indirectly, as a result of such capital investments and the other positive economic effects such capital investments will have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I should acknowledge, Mr. Speaker, that one of the operating pilot projects is the Iowa New Farm Family Project, under which host communities are inviting farm families to establish modern dairy farms in Iowa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And according to Iowa State University, which is our resident authority on the subject matter, "The project has the potential to enrich Iowa communities with young families who establish value-added agricultural businesses ..... and foster healthy economic development ..... The ..... project," which is the Iowa New Farm Family Project, Mr. Speaker, "creates opportunities to increase the population of rural communities, support agriculture, expand value-added agriculture, and maintain Iowa's  existing dairy processing industry." That's as described by Iowa State University, the Iowa New Farm Family Project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to point out that it has been successful, and it's not just agriculture. It can be urban, too, depending on the region and the zone as it's defined. It has been quite helpful to us in Iowa, and I am grateful for the initiatives that have been taken by Members of this House, Members of the Senate who have not just reached out in support of this legislation but reached out to individuals and helped pave the way through the bureaucratic nightmare to get investors to come into the United States  and establish themselves here, where often they will find their economic opportunities have been dried up because of, let's say, capital exchange or regulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It happens to be the case with our dutch dairy families that come in, that the regulations have gotten so heavy in The Netherlands that they want to continue their skill, their family tradition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note that the individual that stood at this particular microphone ahead of me was the gentleman from California who has a dairy tradition in his family, and you look back through generations. This establishes a generational linkage, Mr. Speaker, that I'm very grateful for, and it comes at a particularly good time, especially in the Midwest where we are a center for renewable energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some 6 or 7 years ago, we had almost no industry to produce ethanol, and yet it began back in about 1978 and it began in my neighborhood in my region. And as the first gallon of ethanol was pumped, it became part of an alternative fuel that had been initiated in the late 1970s, came to fruition about 6 or 7 years ago, and since the time I've come to Congress, it has built such an  industry in my region that we now, the Fifth District of Iowa, are the  number one renewable energy producing congressional district in America out of all 435.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because we have the ethanol industry in Iowa, it has been very helpful to our dairy farmers because a byproduct of corn ethanol is the dried distiller strain, or the mash if it comes in a wet form. And the dairy farms have been able to utilize this, as well as anyone has, and it's added value to all of our feed. It's added value to our rough feed, and it's provided a high quality feed which makes it more attractive for our dairy producers to move into the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, the pressure that we're under today with $4 gas, and, by the way, I just happened to check a receipt here, and I paid $141 for a tank of gas, $141.52 on Saturday, Mr. Speaker. That's enough money to put into a gas tank, and that was at $3.85. The folks on the west coast that are over $4 a gallon feel this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what we've done is created a renewable energy industry in the Midwest to help take on some of that burden of providing energy for America. And when we do that, and as of the 2007 crop it hasn't really brought forward the food versus fuel argument. We have produced more corn than ever before, exported more corn than ever before, and still left more corn for domestic consumption than ever before, and we have produced over 9 billion gallons of ethanol. And the byproduct of that 9 billion, you  get about a third of the weight of corn out into ethanol. You get a third of the weight of corn that goes into feed for these dairy cows, for example, and about a third of it goes off in CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2. That's the simple breakdown, which I'll go into more detail with perhaps a Special Order that I can get into the details, Mr. Speaker. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I want to point out that we need these dairy farmers in Iowa. The energy situation is actually a plus because $4 gas holds up the price of corn and holds up the price for ethanol and helps make these systems work, and they're feeding the byproduct in a fashion that's producing more milk in the Midwest. We are still today a net importer of milk in a rural State like Iowa. So we can use some more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the regional center program expires in September. The bill will extend the program an additional 5 years. I think this is a very valuable program, and I support the passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400245" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm sure that we will pass this bill. We have broad bipartisan support for it. But one of the values of debating these bills is not just to enact law but to let the public know of opportunities that the law provides to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it might be instructive to citizens who are observing our proceedings to know that these projects that are being investment-driven through this program are in rural, as well as urban, communities. The regional center staff--actually, it seems to me this pilot project has proven--make this thing work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so there are areas in the country today that are having economic problems. I would encourage those areas, through their local governments, to look very carefully at whether they may want to utilize this program as one piece of putting their economy on the road to recovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note that our colleague Sheila Jackson-Lee expressed her interest in making sure that urban disadvantaged areas be looked at, and I note that Houston, Texas, has actually one of the largest applications of all. It is expected that they will have 7,000 jobs and a $350 million investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is a great opportunity for America. I would hope that we will pass this expeditiously. It is part of getting our economy on the move again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400220" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to pick up on the point made by the gentlelady from California about this is, of course, not by any means a complete solution to the immigration circumstances, but we agree on some of these points, and on this point of attracting investors to the United States who will invest in businesses that create jobs and create wealth, more importantly create wealth. Without the creation of wealth, there's no money to pay the wages. Companies have to make money. It takes capital of course  and it takes labor, it takes ideas, it takes energy, it takes a free market environment and a low regulatory environment. The United States looks better than some of these other countries in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This sends the right message here today that this Congress is interested in opening up and laying out the welcome mat, at least in this specific case, where we ask investors to come into the United States under this EB-5 program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then I would add that there are other interests that we at least philosophically agree on, and one of those is highly skilled immigrants coming into the United States and those that are highly educated. When we can do the calculation on what kind of return we get from someone who comes into the United States as a legal immigrant to work here, to invest here, to start and run a business here, and we can see what they will do from a prosperity perspective, what their contribution will be to the  economy and to the society, there are many records that help support that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we do see, though, Mr. Speaker, is that between 89 and 93 percent of the legal immigration in America isn't based upon merit like this program is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Most of it is based on familial connections, who are you related to, as opposed to what can you do for the United States of America?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I have said for years, we need an immigration policy that's designed to enhance the economic, the social, and the cultural well-being of the United States of America. Every Nation has to have an immigration policy that is for them. And we held a hearing a year or two ago about the point system that some of the countries have established. Canada has one established; the United kingdom is implementing a point system; New Zealand has one; and I believe Australia is looking at one. Those countries  come to mind, where they give certain points for certain categories that demonstrate how a person can contribute to society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, higher education is one category that offers significant merit. The next one is job skills; so that's earning capacity. Another one is language skills, which says how easily they will be able to assimilate in a society. It's not a barrier not having the language, but it's easier to assimilate, of course, if you are fluent in the language of the host country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And another component is youth. If we bring people in here that are 65 years old, that qualify right away for Social Security and Medicare, of course they're not going to be contributing to our economy. And so I plugged myself into the Canadian equation and found out--I don't think the welcome mat is open for me in Canada because I'm a little over the hill, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Youth is a big, important thing because, if you come in at age 22 with a college education, you can contribute to the economy for, let's just say, 43 years before you retire. So youth is an important criteria, as is education, as is job skills, as are language skills. These things are all things that a wise country should reach out for and craft an immigration policy that will enhance the economic, the social, and the cultural well-being of the United States of America, where 89-93 percent of  our legal immigrants are not measured that way; about seven to 11 percent are measured that way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a measure on merit. It is strictly a capital investment, and then meeting the other criteria about establishing the jobs in the business. But I fully support it. It is a bipartisan effort. And it is something that we agree on the theme and the philosophy. I wanted to point out that I believe that we need to set a hard cap on our overall immigration, and then start to shift within those visa allotments so that we get a higher percentage of merit coming in legally into the United States.  And of course control the border, stop the bleeding there; none of this matters unless we can do that, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400245" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that we will likely have an extended debate next year when we visit again the issue of comprehensive immigration reform. I don't  want to get into a debate today, I will just say a core principle of immigration law has always been that the United States Government doesn't tell American citizens who they get to fall in love with and marry. And a second core principle is, when our U.S. citizen marries  somebody from another country, the American doesn't have to move to France, his wife gets to move here. So that's something that we will protect as this debate goes forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has bipartisan support, and I urge its adoption.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support <bill type="h" number="5569">H.R. 5569</bill>. I am proud to join my colleagues in cosponsoring this timely legislation. I would like to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, Chairwoman of the Immigration Subcommittee, for her leadership on sponsoring this legislation. I would also like to thank Mr. Blake Chisam, counsel on the Immigration Subcommittee, and Mr. Arthur Sidney, of my staff, for their important work in including my amendment in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By way of background and explanation, <bill type="h" number="5569">H.R. 5569</bill> extends for five years the EB-5 regional center pilot program. Congress created the fifth employment-based preference, EB-5, immigrant visa category in 1990 for immigrants seeking to engage in a commercial enterprise that will benefit the U.S. economy and create at least 10 full-time jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The basic amount required to invest is $1 million, although that amount may be $500,000 if the investment is made in a "targeted employment area." Of the approximately 10,000 numbers available for this preference each year, 3,000 are reserved for entrepreneurs who invest in targeted employment areas. A separate allocation of 3,000 visas is set aside for entrepreneurs who immigrate through a regional center pilot program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, Congress asked the U.S. Government Accountability Office, GAO, to study the EB-5 program. The GAO report concluded that the program has been under-used for a variety of reasons, including the rigorous application process and the failure to issue regulations implementing the 2002 law. The report found that even though few people have used the EB-5 category, EB-5 participants have invested an estimated $1 billion in a variety of U.S. businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment expresses the sense of Congress that, to the extent possible, qualifying investments should be made in targeted employment areas, including rural areas and areas of high unemployment. My amendment defines rural areas as an area other than an area within a metropolitan statistical area within the outer boundary of any city or town having a population of 20,000 or more based upon the most recent decennial census of the United States. My amendment also defines an area of high unemployment  as an area that has experienced unemployment of at least 150 percent of the national average rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that all of America will benefit from greater development and investment. The amendment is a bold first step in ensuring that all Americans have a seat at the table and are able to progress and advance as a result of foreign investment as Americans in the wealthy cities and suburbs. I have long championed the rights of Americans in the rural areas and in underserved communities. These Americans are our brothers and sisters. To be sure, no Americans should  be left out from investment. My amendment makes sure that these groups that are often forgotten are not left out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. ZOE, LOFGREN of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Zoe Lofgren) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="5569">H.R. 5569</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.</chair>
  <chair>The title was amended so as to read: "A bill to extend for 5 years the EB-5 regional center pilot program, and for other purposes.".</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
