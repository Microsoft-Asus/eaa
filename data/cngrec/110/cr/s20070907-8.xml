    <paragraph>Mr. President, I pause for a moment today, with thousands from across the country who have gathered in Boston, to remember the lives of two of our Massachusetts firefighters, Paul Cahill and Warren Payne, who were laid to rest yesterday and today in West Roxbury and Dorchester. A week ago, Warren and Paul, lost their lives in heroically combating a 4-alarm fire in West Roxbury. We proudly honor the memory of these two heroes who gave their lives so courageously and unselfishly in  the line of duty. We are deeply grateful for their service, and we mourn their loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Cahill was 55 and a father of three children. He had previously served in the U.S. Navy and he joined the Boston Fire Department in 1993.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Warren Payne was 53, and a father of two children. He had been a firefighter for 19 years, and was not scheduled to be on call that night, but he had agreed to help a friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both Paul and Warren were men of immense bravery and dedication, and were committed to the lives and the well-being of their community. Each day they served our city, they were ready to place themselves on the front lines, and the people of Boston will never forget their outstanding service and the difference they made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My heart is in Boston today with the firefighters from across the country, and especially those from Engine 30, Ladder 25 in West Roxbury. They did the job they loved to do. May God bless Paul and Warren, and all of their family and friends who have gathered in Boston to grieve for them.</paragraph>
