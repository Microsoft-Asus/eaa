    <paragraph>Madam President, today I congratulate the top public schools in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I was pleased to learn that U.S. News and World Report awarded seven high schools in Kentucky with a silver medal for their outstanding performance on standardized exams and for providing college-level coursework.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These seven Kentucky high schools have shown that they foster an environment that serves all students, no matter their academic goals, by demonstrating a commitment to excellence through quality education. These Silver Medal Schools back this up with measurable academic outcomes that show improvement throughout a range of performance indicators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have always been proud of Kentucky education because of its relentless effort to enhance and develop the lives of every student. This is a well deserved recognition for the excellent work that is done by all of these high schools, and I would like to congratulate each for its great success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The following schools were commended with awards: Beechwood High School in Fort Mitchell, KY; Bowling Green High School in Bowling Green, KY; Dupont Manual High School in Louisville, KY; Highlands High School in Fort Thomas, KY; Louisville Male High School in Louisville, KY; North Oldham High School in Goshen, KY; and South Oldham High School in Crestwood, KY.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I commend these high schools for a job well done. I hope that their efforts will inspire other schools in Kentucky and around the country to strive for the best.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
