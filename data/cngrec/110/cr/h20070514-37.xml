  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400209" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this week the House will consider the 2008 defense authorization bill. For the sixth year in a row, the bill contains language to rename the Department of the Navy to be the Department of the Navy and Marine Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank House Armed Services Chairman Ike Skelton and Ranking Member Duncan Hunter for their continued support for this change because the need to recognize the coequal status of the Navy and the Marine Corps team is long overdue. I have continued to introduce legislation to rename the department. I hope this year the Senate will support the House position and join in bringing the proper respect to the fighting team of the Navy and Marine Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, this name change has received not only the support of the full House Armed Services Committee but also the support of former Navy Secretaries and Marine Corps Commandants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Honorable Wade Sanders, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Reserve Affairs, 1993 to 1998, voiced his support for the change when he stated: "As a combat veteran and former Navy officer, I understand the importance of the team dynamics and the importance of recognizing the contribution of team components. The Navy and Marine Corps team is just that, a dynamic partnership, and it is important to symbolically recognize the balance of that partnership."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Carl Mundy, the 30th Commandant of the Marine Corps stated: "I believe the changes you propose will do much to clarify the relationship, responsibilities, and functions of the appointed civilian authority over the United States naval services. I believe that any Secretary, present, past or future, will be very proud to bear the title `Marine' as well as `Navy.' "</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Admiral Stansfield Turner, United States Navy, Retired, former Director of Central Intelligence, stated: "I think this change in title enhances the prestige and pride of the people in the Marine Corps. And it does not necessarily take anything away from the Navy in that process."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last year an editorial in the Chicago Tribune on April 21, 2006, also supported the change stating: "No service branch shows more respect for tradition than the United States Marine Corps does, which makes it all the more ironic that tradition denies the Corps an important show of respect: Equal billing with the other services and the branches."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as I begin to close, I want to show the Members of the House, these are the orders from the Secretary of the Navy. Sergeant Michael Bitz, United States Marine Corps, was killed for this country 2 years ago and his family received in his memory the Silver Star for Valor. And yet, Mr. Speaker, you can see that the title of the order says the Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D.C. and the Navy flag. This was a Marine who gave his life for this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Isn't it proper that the orders for the Silver Star should look like this and say at the top the Secretary of the Navy and Marine Corps, Navy flag, Marine flag, they are one fighting team and they should be recognized as a fighting team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is about time, after 40-some years, the House, with the Goldwater-Nichols bill, said there are four separate branches: The Marine Corps, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Army, and it is time that the Marine Corps be recognized as one of the strongest fighting teams in this country.</paragraph>
