  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO FOUR OF NEWARK'S FINEST -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10346]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I come to the House floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the August recess, four young, promising Newark, New Jersey residents were savagely gunned down execution style in a city playground while enjoying the last days of summer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 14, 2007, in my city of Newark, Terrance Aeriel, age 18, Dashon Harvey and Iofemi Hightower, both age 20, were senselessly murdered. Natasha Aeriel, age 19, is still recovering in the hospital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand here today to pay tribute to their lives. While three were cut short, were full of courage and determination and continue to inspire the residents of Newark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Active in their community, these youths stayed above the fray. Dashon, Iofemi and Natasha were avid music lovers and played in their Newark High School marching bands while they attended high school. Terrance, full of charisma, became an ordained minister at age 13.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their hard work paid off; all became students at Delaware State University. Natasha and Dashon were juniors, Terrance was a freshman, and Iofemi was about to begin classes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a testament to how they lived their lives, Natasha, who has undergone many major surgeries and is still  recuperating, provided the police with many key details that led to the apprehension of six suspects. Without her input, some of the suspects may have evaded capture. Her bravery and perseverance is an inspiration for others who, for various reasons, fail to speak up for what is right at times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I know that their families and the community are going through a trying time, I hope they take comfort in the legacy that these four young adults had created. It can be said that this senseless crime cut short their promise, that their destinies went unfilled. I beg to differ. In the short time that they were alive, their lives epitomized consciousness, fortitude and dedication to family and friends. They have and will continue to serve as role models for the young and old in the city of  Newark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to recognize three lives that ended too soon, and one that is still brimming with possibilities. Let us not remember Terrance Aeriel, Dashon Harvey and Iofemi Hightower for the senseless crime that took their lives, but for the lives that they led. As Natasha Aeriel continues to recover, I commend her for her bravery and conviction. I wish to convey my sorrow and condolences again to their families.</paragraph>
