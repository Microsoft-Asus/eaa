    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a person who has been described as "perhaps the best judge never to serve on the Supreme Court." I wish today to honor and remember Judge Richard Arnold as we prepare to name the Federal building in Little Rock after one who has given so much to his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Texarkana native, Judge Arnold attended Exeter, Yale, and Harvard, and clerked for Justice William Brennan before returning to Arkansas to set up practice in Texarkana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Carter named Judge Arnold, a Democrat, to the district court in 1978 and, in just over a year, named him to the Eighth Circuit. He rose to chief judge and served on the Eighth Circuit with his brother Morris, a Republican.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Arnold's life represents one of commitment to the rule of law and of service to one's country. I am proud to see the Federal building in Little Rock named after him, and I am proud to speak of him here in the well of the House.</paragraph>
