    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a Tennessean, I am proud of the success of my three schools that have reached the Sweet Sixteen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In America, there is nothing going on with greater import on the local scene than March Madness; and there is no place more happy about the madness than the State of Tennessee, the Volunteer State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Three of our schools have teams in the Sweet Sixteen: Our land grant university, the University of Tennessee; and my two alma maters, Vanderbilt University and the University of Memphis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Thursday, the University of Tennessee and the University of Memphis will both be playing in the Sweet Sixteen in San Antonio, Texas. Everybody in Texas knows if it weren't for Tennessee, there wouldn't be a Texas. So we bring basketball to Texas, and we brought liberty and independence to Texas. We have a lot of pride in our basketball teams and our universities.</paragraph>
