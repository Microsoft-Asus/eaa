  <narrative>FAREWELL TO THE SENATE -- (Senate - November 20, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10687">S10687</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am grateful to the Senator from Virginia for his comments. I understand that duty calls him to go to his meeting at the CIA. I am grateful for his support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, just before Christmas in 1968, I was appointed to succeed Alaska's first senior Senator, Bob Bartlett. Next month will mark the 40th year I have had the honor and privilege to serve in this great Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, and most important, I thank my family. After my wife Ann's tragic death in 1978, I thought the end of my career had come, but my dear wife Catherine entered my life in 1980, and joined by my six children, Susan, Beth, Ted, Walter, Ben, and Lily, and my 11 grandchildren, my family has given me love, support, and sacrifice, which made my continued career in the Senate possible and gave it meaning. I dearly love each member of my family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Forty years. It is hard to believe that so much time could pass so quickly, but it has. I want everyone listening to know that I treasure every moment I spent here representing Alaska and Alaskans, the land and the people I love.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Member of this body, I served as whip from 1976 to 1984, as chair of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, as chair of the Arms Control Observer Group, as chair of the Ethics Committee, as chair of the Rules Committee, as chair of the Governmental  Affairs Committee, as chair of the Appropriations Committee, as chair of the Commerce Committee, and also had functions as the ranking member as the political change took place back and forth  across this aisle. I also served as President pro tempore and President pro tempore emeritus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am having really a difficult time today articulating my feelings, and I hope if I puddle up a little bit, as my old friend used to say, I will be excused.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I came to the Senate, Alaska had been a State for less than a decade. We were then more of an impoverished territory than a full-fledged State. The commitments made by the Federal Government in our Statehood Act were unfulfilled, and some are still unfulfilled. Alaska had not received the land and resources it had been promised. Poverty and illness reigned supreme in rural regions of our State. I remember so well when Senator Kennedy and I went to the Arctic and examined some of  those villages. It was a disaster. Our fisheries were in peril, primarily from the intrusion of foreign vessels that were anchored just a few miles offshore 12 months out of the year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many people doubted whether Alaska had what it took to be a successful State, and they asked whether Alaska was still Seward's Folly. We proved those doubters were wrong. Working with one another as Alaskans and with great friends in the Senate, Alaskans took control of our own destiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1958, as legislative counselor for the Department of Interior, I worked on Alaska's Statehood Act. Section 4 of that act committed Congress to settle the Alaska Native land claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1971, Congress did enact the Alaska Natives Land Claims Settlement Act, settling aboriginal claims in our State. Native corporations, established at my request to manage $1 billion paid to our State by the Federal Government, and the 44-million acre land settlement are now driving forces in the Alaska economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1973, after a dramatic tie-breaking vote by the Vice President of this Chamber on an amendment which closed the courts of this country to further delay by extreme environmentalists, the President signed into law the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act. That act dramatically improved America's energy security and secured the economic future of Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1976, Congress passed what became known as the Magnuson-Stevens Act to fight foreign fishing fleets which endangered America's fisheries. Because of that act, America's fisheries today are the most productive and the best managed in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Working within the framework of these basic laws, Alaskans have labored in the appropriations and administrative process to make statehood a reality. Where there was nothing but tundra and forest, today there are now airports, roads, ports, water and sewer systems, hospitals, clinics, communications networks, research labs, and much, much more. Alaska was not Seward's folly and is no longer an impoverished territory. Alaska is a great State and an essential contributor to our Nation's energy  security and national defense. I am proud to have had a role in this transformation. Working to help Alaska achieve its potential has been and will continue to be my life's work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My motto has been here "to hell with politics, just do what's right for Alaska," and I have tried every day to live up to those words. I take great pride in the work of the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, the leadership of which I have shared for almost three decades with my brother Senator Dan Inouye, and I thank him for being here. He is a great American patriot and a true friend. Together, we have worked to rebuild our Armed Forces to provide the support and training needed  by our warfighters to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't have time today to recount the highlights of 40 years of work in this body. That will take a lot of time. I will take time, however, to acknowledge the friendships I have enjoyed with so many of my colleagues and Senate staffers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I really am grateful to every Member of the Senate for their friendship, and I bear no ill will toward any Member of this body. I am most grateful for the support and counsel of my colleagues in the Alaska congressional delegation, my old friend in the House, Congressman Don Young, who has done so much for our State, and my steadfast partner in the Senate, Senator Lisa Murkowski, to whom I owe so much and admire so much. She has been a true friend and true partner. I wish her  well in the future here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to acknowledge the tremendous contribution made by hundreds of young Alaskans who have come to Washington to serve on my staff. In particular, let me express my gratitude to my current staff, all of whom have worked hard for Alaska during the toughest of times. I know all will go on to do great things for Alaska and our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I feel blessed by God to have had the opportunity to serve in this body. I deeply appreciate the trust Alaskans have reposed in me for 40 years. When Alaska needed a strong voice to speak up for its interests, I did my part to the best of my ability. When an administration submitted legislation or a budget that ignored Alaska's legislative concerns, I urged Congress to exercise its constitutional power to redress the balance. When an Alaskan--any Alaskan--or any Alaskan entity needed help, my  office was ready and did help to the maximum extent possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I feel the same way now that I did in 1968. I really must pinch myself to fully understand that I am privileged to speak on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Coming from the boyhood I had, I could never even have dreamed of being here today. And home is where the heart is, Mr. President. If that is so, I have two homes--one is right here in this Chamber, and the other is my beloved State of Alaska. I must leave one to return to the other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I leave the Senate and the work that has given me so much happiness and satisfaction over the years, I know Senator Murkowski and Congressman Young will continue to be strong voices for our 49th State. This is the last frontier. I also pray for my successor's success as he joins in that effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My mission in life is not complete. I believe God will give me more opportunities to be of service to Alaska and to our Nation. And I look forward with glad heart and with confidence in its justice and mercy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I told members of the press yesterday that I don't have any rearview mirror. I look only forward, and I still see the day when I can remove the cloud that currently surrounds me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's it, Mr. President, 40 years distilled into a few minutes, I close by saying and asking that God bless Alaska and our Governor, God bless the United States of America and our President, and God bless the Senate and every Member of this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor for the last time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Applause; Senators rising.)</narrative>
  <chair> The majority leader is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to say farewell to our distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from the State of Alaska. Ted Stevens' public service has been more than a career, it has really been his life's calling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After serving in World War II, where he rose to the rank of first lieutenant, Ted Stevens completed undergraduate work at UCLA and received a law degree from Harvard. He then came to Washington, DC, for the first time to work for President Eisenhower. His career in elected office started in 1964 with his election to the Alaska House of Representatives. He became majority leader in his second term. Appointed to the U.S. Senate in 1968, Ted Stevens was returned by the voters of  Alaska six times and last year became the longest serving U.S. Republican Senator in our Nation's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His career has been more than about longevity. He has been an advocate for his State. And that is an understatement. He has served as President pro tempore of the Senate, and now emeritus. He has been a senior member of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committees. He has been heavily involved, as I know, in the Appropriations Committee, Homeland Security Committee, and Rules Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is where I have become so well acquainted with Ted Stevens, is on the Appropriations Committee. I had the good fortune of helping on the floor on a number of appropriations bills. I consider a mark of distinction and something I will always remember my  Hulk tie Senator</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stevens gave me. I don't know anyone else he gave one to, but it was his way of saying thanks for getting that appropriations bill done; I liked the way you worked to get it done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Events have transpired in Senator Stevens' life these past 2 years that are deeply unfortunate. He and I had a number of conversations about what was going on. I wish nothing but the best for Ted, Catherine, and his daughter, whom I have known since she was a little girl, now a distinguished lawyer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I said in the past that Senator Stevens flew in World War II with the Flying Tigers, on the Senate floor he will always be remembered as a lion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have two final stories. I was a brandnew Senator, and my friend Alan Bible died. Alan Bible served the State of Nevada with distinction for 20 years. A military aircraft was provided to take those who wished to go to Nevada for the funeral. There were two people on that airplane--Harry Reid and Ted Stevens. Think about that. We flew to Reno, NV, for a funeral. We went out and back in 1 day. It takes 5 hours to go out that way and 5 hours to come back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said--and I was a new Senator: Senator Stevens, why are you on the airplane? I framed it a little differently than that. He said: I have a long memory. The Alaska pipeline bill would not have passed but for Alan Bible. It was very hard for him to make up his mind what he wanted to do, and when he did, he was the culminating vote that allowed that to pass. He said: I had to go to Reno to honor what Alan Bible did for me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, everyone knows I have a unique relationship with Dan Inouye. When he ran for leader, I supported him above anyone else. I did it because he had been so good to me personally and, I felt, good to the Senate. And, of course, I admired this man for what he had done for our country, not only in the House of Representatives and in the Senate but as a soldier in Italy where he was badly wounded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It doesn't take much intelligence to understand that the most secure, lasting friendship in this Senate and one that probably is a friendship I have never seen before is the one with Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye. Terms are thrown around a lot: "He's my brother." With Dan Inouye and Ted Stevens, they are brothers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bible tells us in the Old Testament: "Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labor. For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, for he hath not another to help him up."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dan Inouye may not be the most powerful physical person in the world, but I think he is the most powerful friend a person could have. And as Scripture indicates, he will always be there for his friend, Ted Stevens.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Republican leader is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Senate colleagues, how does one sum up the extraordinary accomplishments of the longest serving Republican Senator in U.S. history? The majority leader has summarized Senator Stevens' career, but I think there is a way to measure it and to summarize it that is even shorter. I think it is safe to say, without any fear of contradiction, there is no Senator in the history of the United States who has ever done more for his State than Senator Ted  Stevens. Alaska would not be what it is today----</paragraph>

  <chair> The junior Senator from Alaska.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300075" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to speak this morning from the perspective of an Alaskan. Sometimes it is not appropriate for a woman to acknowledge her age, but when Senator Stevens first came to this body, I was 11 years old. Senator Stevens, Ted Stevens, has been "Alaska" in this Senate for four decades now. Many Senators earn their place in the history of their States during the course of service in the Senate. But by the time Ted came to the  Senate back in 1968, he had already earned his place in Alaskan history. He had earned his place in Alaska's history for his work a decade earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an Interior Department attorney in the late 1950s, Ted was the Eisenhower administration's point man on Alaska statehood. Well, this year, our State is celebrating its 50th anniversary of statehood. But for the persistence of Ted Stevens at that time, our statehood anniversary date might be celebrated some years off in the future. It was that persistence that Ted brought to the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Historians will record the life of Ted Stevens and the history of post-statehood Alaska and suggest they are all interwoven. But I think there is an easier way to express that. When I think of the good things, the positive things, that have come to Alaska in the past 50 years, I see the face and I see the hands of Ted Stevens in so many of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of them are so small, like a washeteria for Golovin, a village of 67 people people near Nome. Ted Stevens, through funding from the Denali Commission, has enabled that village to have that washeteria. You might not think much of that, but when you don't have a water and sewer system and you don't have a place for basic sanitary services, providing a washing facility in a little community is a big deal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are also the big projects, whether it is our 800-mile trans-Alaska pipeline that Senator Stevens helped to create or the settlement of our Alaska Native land claims, the fact that we have F-22s at Elmendorf Air Force Base, or a compromise recently that allowed Eielson Air Force Base to remain a vibrant and strategic center for our military. And then the big things that are yet to come, as we are working to advance a natural gas pipeline to bring that energy source to the lower  48. We will also have a new VA outpatient clinic in Anchorage that Ted has been responsible for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Alaskans think about the difficult debates, the issues Congress has dealt with over the years as they relate to Alaska--and primarily these are debates where the Nation has sought to tell Alaskans what we should be doing to manage our lands, to develop our economies, to live our lives. Every time there has been an argument, a debate, a victory, it has been the forceful voice of Ted Stevens defending the right of Alaskans that prevails.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all knew when he would come to the floor wearing his Incredible Hulk tie, he was fighting a battle for Alaska that day, and look out. Whether it was our timber issues or the battle over ANWR or our fisheries, he was there working, fighting, compromising, negotiating these battles for the State of Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a lot of things we know about Ted and his passions, as he has demonstrated them here on the floor, but there are some other things you might not know about Senator Stevens and what drives him, such as his care and his passion and support for world-class fishing out on the Kenai River, his support for public broadcasting, which earned him two national awards, and his undying commitment for the Olympic movement and amateur athletics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Somebody mentioned it would take a long time to enumerate the accomplishments of Ted Stevens. Mr. Majority Leader, I might suggest that in order to do that, it would take as long as it took you when you read your book about Searchlight on the floor when I was sitting in the Presiding Officer's chair. We don't have time to do that this morning, and that is not my purpose today. But I would like to refer to Ted's accomplishments in two small areas to illustrate a point I wish  to make about his character and his personal commitment to public service. These are in the areas of what he has done to improve the lives of Alaska's Native people and also his legacy to America's fisheries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is often said a society is judged by the way it treats its most vulnerable members, and it is appropriate we judge the character of our elected leaders in a similar way. In Alaska, the most vulnerable among us are our Alaska Native people--the 120,000 or so Aleuts, Eskimos, and Indians who are the descendants of Alaska's first inhabitants. We recognize that the statistics  about the condition of our Alaskan Natives are not something of which we are  proud, with incomes that are half of other Alaskans and high rates of domestic violence, suicide, child abuse, violent deaths, and a prison rate among our population which is not acceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For decades, Alaska's most vulnerable people have had no better friend than Ted Stevens. If you go to Ted's Web site, it lists his milestone legislative accomplishments, and 8 of the 13 are directed to improving the conditions of Alaska's first people. So many of them are so basic. You have all heard the stories; Ted has stood on the floor and talked about the economic conditions we face--the fact that we don't have road systems, the fact we have to fly to most of the  villages or go by boat--but the reality is that in so many of our communities, in so many of our villages, we still don't have basic water and sanitation for those who live there. Before Ted Stevens came to the Senate, many of these villages had no running water, no flush toilets, no plumbing, no place to wash clothes or take a shower--the basic needs when it comes to sanitation and health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In so many instances, our Native people have lived, and some still live, in what could be called Third World conditions, conditions that wouldn't be tolerated anywhere in this country, and conditions that Ted Stevens would not tolerate. He determined he was going to change it and he did. In 1980, only about 20 percent of the rural houses in Alaska had indoor sanitation facilities. Thanks to Ted Stevens, that percentage has risen to well over 75 percent. Now, we still have a  ways to go, but what he has done is pretty remarkable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Talking about health improvements and conditions, it is almost impossible to recruit health professionals to our small and remote areas. So Ted looked into the future and wondered how we were going to provide access, how we were going to provide for the needs of those who live out here. And he said: Well, let's think ahead, and he brought statewide telemedicine. It is the backbone of what we have in Alaska in terms of how we provide for our health care needs. It is the largest telemedicine  program in the world. It gives first responders an ability to consult with doctors in the larger cities. Thanks to Ted Stevens, people's lives have been saved. He has made an enormous difference in our community. He has championed the construction of hospitals in our rural hubs out in Kotzebue, Barrow, Nome, and Dillingham. He has brought about the community health centers and health clinics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know a lot of you have had an opportunity to come to Alaska, and your first stop is the airport in Anchorage, and you notice that the airport is named after Ted Stevens. Well, you might not know that there is a large monument at the entrance to the Alaska Native Medical Center that has been erected to remind Alaskans that this facility would not have been possible without the work of Ted Stevens. So our Alaska Natives today enjoy an integrated, high quality health care system  thanks to Ted Stevens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is important for us to remember because so much of what we see in the Senate, the record that is created, we don't have the opportunity to see how that translates to the people Ted Stevens has represented for some 40 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other areas he has worked for Alaska's Natives involve work to preserve their cultural lifestyles through preservation of their subsistence traditions and making sure the Inupiaq people can continue their whaling and helping with economic opportunities and reducing transportation costs. We are seeing a migration from our smaller villages into our larger cities, but I can tell you, without the lifestyle improvements Ted Stevens has brought to rural Alaska, our Native people would have  left their villages decades ago. So I wish to thank you, Ted, for all you have done there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mentioned the fishery resource, and Senator Stevens himself mentioned that in his comments, but it was nearly 40 years ago that Ted joined with Warren Magnuson and developed a new management regime for our fisheries. This was at a time when our fisheries in the United States, including Alaska, were heavily overfished by foreign fleets. The Magnuson-Stevens Act helped put America back in the fishing industry. This legislation also created the Regional Fishery Management Council.  It is largely responsible for the development of Alaska's sustainable fisheries. We are very proud of the fact that to this day we supply about half the seafood that is caught in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was at Ted Stevens' insistence that the United States negotiated an agreement to stop the illegal fishing in the international waters of the Bering Sea. This agreement has restored the Alaska pollock fishery from near collapse. He has been an absolute champion of ocean conservation. He pushed the U.N. to ban high seas drift net fishing, a practice that was devastating our salmon fisheries. Alaska fishermen will never forget Ted Stevens, the conservationist, the advocate who  has truly helped bring our fisheries where they are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ted's departure from the Senate truly leaves a void in our hearts and some very big shoes to fill here in the Senate. There are a lot of us in Alaska who are wondering if anyone can fill these shoes. We agonize over whether the Federal Government's interest in Alaska is going to dwindle without Ted here to fight for us. But I am optimistic, Ted, that is not going to be the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You have said many times in speeches you have given here on the floor and back at home--you voiced the words of GEN Billy Mitchell back in 1935 when he said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that, in the future, whoever holds Alaska will hold the world. ..... I think it is the most important strategic place in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those words of Billy Mitchell, I think you and I agree, hold true today. Alaska continues to provide this top cover for the defense of the North American Continent. Our troops tell us our communities in Alaska support the military like nowhere else in the country. The heartfelt appreciation is genuine. We offer unencumbered military training areas that are simply not available anywhere else. Our resources--our natural gas, our mineral resources--will support and continue to support America's  national security for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through his investments in the development of our State and our people, Ted Stevens has helped to prepare Alaska to meet its future challenges. We are a strong and confident and skilled people, and we are empowered--we are empowered by all Ted's work has brought to us over 40 years of service in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Ted may leave this body, I think all of us will continue to seek his advice, his counsel, and his wisdom for as long as he is willing to offer it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ted, you have earned a very special place in the golden hearts of Alaskans, and you hold a very special place in my heart. Thank you for your service to Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, all of us realize the events of recent weeks have been less than pleasant and at times dismal and heartbreaking. But to my friend, I say stand tall, Ted, because you have every reason to do so. Your good and courageous service to our Nation is part of our history. It can never be obliterated. Your service to the people of Alaska is legendary, and I am certain that in decades to come, Native Alaskans--Eskimos and Indians--will be singing you songs of praise.  But above all, I thank you for your four decades of friendship. I will cherish them. Thank you.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have been thinking, while sitting here listening to the eloquent remarks of the senior Senator from Alaska on this day, I have been here a long time, and so has he, the Senator from Alaska, although he is just a youngster compared to me. Some in this town would say we have both lived too long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A long life is a blessing for many reasons. One of the reasons is one learns a lot. One learns to take the bad with the good. One learns to separate the phonies from the friends. One learns that family is the most important gift. One learns to appreciate small, special moments and the really good things in life--like a good laugh, a good cry, a good dog, and a good meal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Politics is a rough business, with lots of highs and lots of lows. After a long time in politics, I come to understand that the point of it all is helping people. Ted Stevens has helped a lot of people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all make mistakes. I have made more of them than I have hair follicles. But thank God we will be judged in the next world by the good we do in this world. Ted Stevens has done a lot of good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish for you, my friend Ted Stevens, many happy years. I know you will never stop working for the people of your beloved State of Alaska. Bless your heart, Ted. I love you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer an Irish blessing: May all the roads that you have built, Ted, rise up to meet you, and may the wind, Ted, be always at your back. May the Sun shine warmly upon your face, Ted, and may the rains fall softly upon your fields. And until we meet again, may God hold you, Ted, in the hollow of His hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bless your heart, Ted. I love you.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise now because I look around and I don't think there is any Senator left on the floor who has served longer than I with him. He has had his 40; I have had my 36.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator, I just want to say this to you. The Constitution of the United States said that there will be a difference between the Senate and the House. They said the way to get a constitution is to make sure they provide that individually the States would be adequately represented. And they said: We will make sure of that by creating a U.S. Senate where two Senators represent the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friend, I want to say to you, obviously I have traveled a little bit different path in my 36 years, but many times the paths have crossed--you and this Senator. I do want to say that, more than anyone else, you have taught me the meaning of representing my State. You are unabashed about that. That caused me on many occasions to think about what I was doing and whether I was representing my State correctly, to the full extent of my ability, and whether I did that with gusto, knowing that we  needed things. For we are comparable in that we are a very poor State. We are among the last that came in, and we have many of the same problems you have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has truly been a luxury of my life to work with you, to see how you got things done, and, from time to time, to be able to help you because you asked--you were unabashed in that regard too--to help your State. You would ask any of us to join you in your cause, and most of us did that willingly.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>You bet.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>But, Senator, I wish to say just a word to the people of your State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know Ted Stevens as a Senator representing you people. A big event has occurred in the life of Ted Stevens that you people of Alaska quite properly have been involved in. But none of us who have worked with him could let this day pass with anyone not knowing--whether they be in Alaska, a Native of Alaska or resident of Alaska or a Native, true Native--all of you must know of the high respect and great esteem in which we hold your Senator. We are most grateful that you sent  him here for 40 years. For some of us, it ends too abruptly, but every ride seems to have an end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All I hope is, with what you have left in your life, that you will feel this day is a special one, when Senators have put their hearts out here on the Senate floor to tell you who you were to them, what you meant to them. I hope I have done my share in my few moments. Nobody will know how many times we have talked and met, how many times you and I have shared personal things and gone on with our own business, but we were certain to mention our personal problems along with it, things we wanted  to share as men. I thank you for every bit of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the extent that some of our prayers and the prayers of some of our relatives whom I asked personally to pray for you--I hope it has had some good. I hope when you were down, you were lifted a bit. I hope that today you are going to be lifted more so that you can stand what is ahead of you with a high head and come out of it with more of the successes of your life right out in front of you for you to feel and touch, as those hard issues still remain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for your friendship.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, much that has been true and honest has been said by our colleagues this morning to support and pay tribute to the unique, the great and historic service of Senator Ted Stevens to Alaska and to our country. I will come back to that, but I wish to take a moment to speak about Ted Stevens as a friend and a neighbor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It happened that when I first came to the Senate 20 years ago, our wives, Catherine and Hadassah, became friends. As usual, they led us in the right direction--which is toward each other. In fact, it was Catherine and Ted's counsel and urging to Hadassah and me that led us, after 6 years living somewhere else, to the neighborhood we live in now, which is where they used to live. In the last several years, they have come back to that neighborhood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maybe, beyond the news that comes out of the Senate in Washington and the politics that dominates the news, a lot of people back home and around the country do not realize we are actually just normal people--we live in neighborhoods here, we have friends, and we get to know our friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I speak of Ted in that regard. Once years ago somebody said: What can you tell me about Ted Stevens? I can tell you a lot and others can about what he is like as a Senator. I will tell you this, that Hadassah and I talked the other day and we said: Who would we call, of our colleagues in the Senate, if something happened in the family?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now I think about it, it was said at 3 a.m. in the morning. That was before the commercials in the last campaign. But this was not about a national emergency, this was about something that happened in the family and you needed somebody's help to come over and watch the kids or something such as that. We said we would call Ted and Catherine Stevens. I never had to make that call, but I have no doubt they would have responded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have gotten to know Ted Stevens very well. This is a good and honorable man. He is a wise man, reads a lot. And in recent years we have exchanged books, usually adventure novels, with one another. He has a tremendous sense of history, and more than some might appreciate, he has a great sense of humor as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I salute him as a good and honorable man, a man of faith who has served our country with great effect. I want to take a moment before I close to talk about the extraordinary service and supportive leadership Ted Stevens has given to the Armed Forces of the United States and, therefore, to the security of every American, the freedom of every American, and I would say the security and freedom of people in countries all over the world who have benefited from the courage of our military,  the skill of our military, and even more directly because of the support Ted Stevens and Dan Inouye have given to our allies militarily around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The distinguished Republican leader said he could not think of any Senator who had done more for his State in the history of the Senate than Ted Stevens has done for Alaska. I would say something else at this moment. Remember, we have constitutional responsibilities that we swear to uphold when we take the oath of office as Senators. One of the great ones, perhaps the first one, which precedes all others, is to provide for the common defense. I honestly cannot think of two Senators who  have done more to protect the security of the United States of America, and therefore our freedom, than Ted Stevens and Dan Inouye.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, we talk a lot around here about partisanship. All of us agree that there has been too much of it, that it gets in the way of us getting things done. I have been privileged in the years I have been on the Homeland Security Committee to have had a wonderful relationship with Senator Collins, whether she has been chairman or I have been chairman. But this relationship between Ted Stevens and Dan Inouye is unique. Regardless of which one was in the majority and  which was in the so-called minority, these two were cochairs. They shared staff, they helped each other, because the party affiliation ultimately did not matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What did you say your oath was? To hell with politics, I have got to do what is good for Alaska. I am going to say, in so many ways, particularly working with Dan Inouye, you have said throughout this 40 years, particularly in the years you have worked together on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, to hell with politics, we, Dan Inouye and I, are going to do what is good for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I salute you for that. I thank you for that. I love the fact that you said in your remarks that you are confident God has more work for you to do. I share that confidence and that faith. I wish you and your wonderful family, your beloved wife Catherine and your children, all of God's blessings in the years ahead.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="">
    <paragraph>I remember the first time I met Ted Stevens. It was back in 1976 when I was a young candidate for office, citizen candidate, hardly knew where the Senate floor was. I have loved and admired him ever since. We have been in the presence of three great senior lions in the Senate. Bob Byrd, as we all know, has served this Senate many years. And I love these three people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dan Inouye. I admire him so much for the courage, honor, and friendship he has displayed to so many of us. But above all, to Ted Stevens. Ted Stevens is truly one of the greatest Senators who ever sat here. All three of them are. They have been exemplary to all of us, but especially me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have watched them. I have learned from them. Hopefully I have not heard the last of my dear friend Ted. Ted Stevens personifies a person with real guts, with real ability, that dedication to his State, dedication to every person in his State regardless of politics, religion, or anything else. He has worked his behind off for 40 years, and actually longer than that, in public service--one of the greatest men I have ever met.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I always loved him when he wore the Incredible Hulk tie. I always got a big kick out of it. I even liked his crankiness, because there was always a little smile behind it. He never held a grudge against anybody, and he was always willing to lend a helping hand and give good advice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, I admire him so much. Ted, I believe this cloud will be lifted from you. It should be. The fact is that you are a great man in a great body here where so few rise to the top level. You really have. You have shown such kindness and graciousness to virtually everybody here, and enough toughness too, when we have needed it. You are a great leader. I for one am going to miss you as a Member of this body. I hope we will not miss you as a friend and colleague in the future, because  you will always be my colleague. You will always be somebody I look up to. You will always be somebody who I learn from. You will always be somebody who has stood for things that count: family, home, State, country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not know if I can say anything much better than that. But all I can say is this is a good man. He deserves to be remembered as a great man as well. We all love you. We wish you the best. We hope we continue to see a lot of you.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Washington State.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300076" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of many citizens of Washington State who are friends of the Senator from Alaska. On their behalf today, I say thank you for all of the work that you have done for your neighbor to the South.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obviously, everyone here has listed the many accomplishments of the senior Senator from Alaska in his many decades of service. We are a State that considers Alaska a neighbor. He has been an ally of ours many times over, and throughout his long service in serving his own State, has also helped the citizens I represent. I thank him for that today. I thank him for his years of service on the Appropriations Committee where I watched him as the Chair and ranking member, where though he may be a strong  adversary, he also understood that everyone had a right to speak and had a right to offer arguments and respected that. I think that is truly a lesson all of us should remember.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I want to share a lesson that the Senator from Alaska also taught me that I think is important for this time as well. Several years ago I was privileged to join the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii on a delegation trip to China where we met with officials across the country to talk about the important issues facing our country and China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Inouye was called away, and I was left as the senior Democrat on the trip. We met with leaders from China across the table from us. Senator Stevens led many of these meetings but on several occasions turned to me to ask me to lead those. As we were leaving China, I thanked him for that respect he gave me in front of our delegation and in front of theirs. He said to me he thought it was important that the people of China see that even though we have two different parties  here with very strong opinions we respect each other and out of that respect are able to lead this country facing the challenges we have in front of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He used that as a lesson to China, but it was a lesson to me as well, that we do have two strong parties, but in the end we serve the people of America, and we do it by respecting each other. So I stand today and join my colleagues in thanking the Senator from Alaska for being the leader he has been here, for the work he has done, and wish him the very best in his future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300083" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, first impressions are always important. I think many times they are completely false. I was a Member of the House when I first met Ted Stevens. It was at a retreat our party was having, and I sat there wondering what on Earth makes this man tick. Here was the most obstreperous if not outrageous person expressing his opinion, despite any other person who had an objection, who insisted on making his point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I went away from that meeting and said: That Ted Stevens fellow is one of the most unique people I have ever met. I would just as soon not meet him again. Then I found out that he was running for leadership of the Republican party in this distinguished body against my friend and colleague, mentor, hero, Bob Dole, and came within one vote. There is a story there, but we will not get into that. And so that was the history as I regarded Ted Stevens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I came to the Senate, had the privilege of being elected to the Senate in 1996. I was standing right over there. All of a sudden there was Ted Stevens standing in front of me. That was sort of a frightening experience for a new Senator. But he came up and he jabbed his finger on my chest--Ted, you will not remember this--and he said, "I know who you are."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said, "Well, I sure as hell know who you are."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said, "You allegedly know something about agriculture. Bob Dole told me about you, said you were a stand-up guy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said, "Thank you. That is a real compliment."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said, "You serve on Armed Services and Intelligence?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said, "Yes, sir, I do."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said, "How would you like to go to the Russian Far East with me?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought to myself: Why on Earth would I want to go to the Russian Far East?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said, "We are going to go to Habarodfk. I can assure you, Habarodfk is not one of the places that you would want to go to if you had free time to go anywhere." And he said, "Then we are going to go to Vladivostok. We are going to meet with the admiral of the Russian navy. He is closer to Alaska than he is to Moscow. I know him."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought, this is a man who has unusual relationships with people all around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"And then we are going to go to South Korea to meet one of the many presidents that come and go in South Korea to indicate our strong support. But then we are going to be the first delegation allowed into North Korea."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, that got my attention. He said, "That is why I would like to have you come along, because if we could arrange a third-party grain sale"--and I guess this is not classified anymore, but at any rate--"arrange a third-party grain sale, and using agriculture as a tool for peace, there are things we can do in North Korea to at least establish a relationship."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This man has tried to do that all around the world with our adversaries.  People talk about that a lot, that he actually just does it. He does not make any press releases about it, does not talk about it much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I said, "Well, sure, I will sign up."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And he said, "I understand that you are a journalist."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said, "Yep, that is an unemployed newsman."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And he said, "You could be the scribe in regard to this CODEL." I might say that any CODEL you went on with Ted Stevens, you always had a T-shirt saying: "I survived CODEL Stevens" because you would go to the South Pole, you would go to other places, but you didn't go to the water holes where apparently the business executives of our financial institutions go now to think about things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In any case, we went to Habarovsk where I had a little discussion with Senator Inouye about where we were staying, our accommodations, and got to know Danny very well. We went to Vladivostok. We talked to that admiral who felt closer to Ted Stevens than he did the Russian Government at that particular time. We went to Sakhalin Island. There are tremendous oil reserves there. He was trying to work out some kind of arrangement where American oil companies could come in  and take advantage of all of the oil reserves. We had to work our way through the saber-toothed tigers; I am not making that up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we went to South Korea because you have to go to South Korea if you are going to go to North Korea. That is just required. Then we went into North Korea. Darnedest experience I have ever had in my life. It was a situation where that is a theocracy. It is a robotic theocracy. If there is a trudging contest in the Olympics, the North Koreans will win without any question. It was the first delegation allowed into North Korea. Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens met with the  North Koreans. It was Senator Cochran who insisted on going to a farm. I say that with a smile. We did that. I will just say from an agricultural standpoint, it was just a field with nothing there except a 1938 Case tractor with a camouflage net over it. That sort of tells you</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At any rate, this discussion had gone on and on and on, and there was an interpreter with the two people with whom we were meeting. We had hoped to meet with Kim Jong-il. That was not possible. So he sent two of his puppets down there to meet with us. They were just going back and forth with propaganda and we were serious. We had permission from the Treasury to waive certain requirements so we could arrange for a third party grain sale to assist North Korea which goes through a famine every harvesting  year. In response, we could ask for other things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So you had two World War II veterans who told these two individuals: We are World War II veterans. We want to make Pammunjon a tourist attraction. We want to make real progress about that. Finally, Ted had it up to here. He said: Knock off the BS. I know you understand English. Just take the interpreter out of it and let's get to the bottom line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line was that they couldn't do anything. They were there to learn what we were about. They really couldn't make any decisions. That was a real lost opportunity at that particular time. I will never forget his leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At any rate, I would just like to say on another CODEL, I don't even know which one it was, we landed at 11 and we got to the hotel about midnight. This man is a great connoisseur of military movies, military history, almost any other movie. He is a great devotee of that great documentary "Band of Brothers." So we were playing "Band of Brothers" to virtually staff and to all present. And this is at 12:30 at night. We had reached episode 5; we were going to episode 6. So there we all were.  And, of course, it was playing and playing. I looked around. All the staff were asleep. Loyal, they were still there, but they were asleep. Then all the Members who were still there, because you didn't leave in regards to the Stevens entourage and whatever performance he decided that we should see, so consequently, I was having a hard time keeping my eyelids open.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I looked over at him and his eyes were closed. I thought, the great man has his eyes closed. Everybody else is asleep. So I will get up, the scribe of the CODEL, and look around and gently turn off the television and then I can gently wake him up and say: "Ted, it is pretty late, 1 o'clock. We all ought to go to bed."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I reached for the button to turn off the power, he said: "This next part is the best part." He wasn't watching it; he was listening because he had seen it about three times. Well, needless to say, we saw episode 6 in its entirety. Thank the Lord, we didn't go into episode 7. We would have been there all night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just say, I was present for the ceremonies in Alaska when Ted was named the Alaskan of the Century. How can a sitting Senator or a sitting Member of Congress or anybody get citizen approval or approval from his State or accolades from his State at that particular time. But he was Alaskan of the Century. His name was everywhere. I told him the Anchorage Daily News should have been the "Ted Stevens News."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I had the unique privilege of roasting this man, which I enjoyed thoroughly, and then got pretty serious toward the end. At any rate, he flew in on a World War II plane. He had his combat jacket. He came in with Catherine and took his place on two very posh chairs. And I quoted again that saying he has said, and it has been said today by the Senator himself and by others: "The hell with politics; let's do what is good for Alaska." I will add: And the country and our national defense and  for every man and woman in uniform; they owe this man a great debt. That is a true thing that he has done in terms of his service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a journalist. I am an old newspaper guy. My great-grandfather founded the second oldest newspaper in the State of Kansas, John Wesley Roberts. He was an abolitionist. I have printer's ink in my blood. The only thing I would say to my fellow colleagues who have now left the galleries because the show is over, or at least up to this point, I would only say to my colleagues that I don't know who sang the song, "You Don't Know Me." Maybe that was Patsy Cline; maybe it was somebody else. I  will have to Google it. But at any rate, you don't know him. You really don't know him. This is a man with a very gruff exterior, but he is a teddy bear when you really get to know him. I know that because that is exactly what my daughter labeled him when she worked part-time for him some years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a matter of fact, she called him the mad penguin. She never called him that to his face. I don't know if you knew that or not, Ted. But that was the label.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So under this great, gruff facade--i.e., the mad penguin--there is a compassionate, caring, wise and, yes, a man with a very good sense of humor which I enjoyed immensely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you come to this body and you come to public service, you know that you risk your ideas, your thoughts, your hopes, and your dreams before the crowd. Sometimes the crowd says yes, and you have friends who will stand behind you when you are taking the bows. Then when something happens in your life, when it is most unfortunate--and my family has experienced this as well--you wonder where your friends are who will stand beside you when you are taking the boos as opposed to the bows.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to tell you that being the Alaskan of the Century and the Alaskan or the Senator who has done so much for the country and my State of Kansas, I stand next to you, Ted, and as many have said: You are a dear friend. I love you. God bless.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I so appreciate hearing the many stories that Ted Stevens has generated in this body. He has been a friend to everyone who has served all of the time with him. People say: Ted took care of Alaska. Ted did take care of Alaska. But from my standpoint, what I saw is that Ted made sure that every State was taken care of, that every Senator's priorities were met, if at all possible. He  took  care of the military. He took care of upgrading the military bases because, of course, he served in the military. And he wanted more than anything for our military people to have the quality of life they deserved. So I see him as someone who has been what people say is so rare in this city, and that is a true friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been mentioned a couple of times that he has a gruff exterior. When I see pictures of him in the newspaper and he is looking like this, it is not the Ted Stevens we know. It is not the person who has endeared himself to our colleagues for years and years and years in the Senate. That is his manner, but I always said behind his back: He is all bark and no bite. He is the most loyal friend and the person you could go to when you needed advice, as I know his great colleague from  Alaska, Senator Murkowski, has done many times, as have I, but also when you needed help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, too, have traveled with Ted Stevens and Danny Inouye because I was fortunate enough, with Ted's help, to get on the Defense Appropriations Committee. So we went to the garden spots of the world such as Bosnia, when the Serbs had been shooting from the hills, and when we went undercover with flight jackets, undercover of delivering 2,000 pounds of peas to the many refugees who were in Bosnia at the time. We came into the Sarajevo airport with our helmets on and our  flight jackets. Of course, it was a war-torn city. We saw later, when we went there, the former Olympic fields that were burial grounds because they had no place else to put the people who had died in these terrible, tragic circumstances in Bosnia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I went with Ted Stevens and Danny Inouye to Saudi Arabia where I was told later that it was actually discouraged that a woman would be in a delegation. But Ted Stevens said: No way was there ever going to be discrimination against a Senator. I was a part of that delegation. I went to our airbase there. I went and met with everyone we met with as a delegation. I spoke in my turn, just as every member of our delegation did, because Ted Stevens was always going  to stand up for the right of every Senator to be a part of a foreign delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I went to the farm bureau air show with Ted Stevens. There is nothing more joyous than Ted Stevens when he is in an air museum or at an air show. He is an aviator to his core. He asked all the questions. He knew most of the answers already because he knows airplanes and he knows aviation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know what this man has been through for the last few months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know the toll it takes on himself and his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to stand with Ted Stevens because I value his friendship and all he has done for me in my term in the Senate and what he has done for Texas every time I have needed for Texas to be taken care of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will say two things in conclusion about Ted Stevens. His country has never called that he has not answered the call--from the military, to being in the Eisenhower administration, to fighting for Alaska to be a State, and then fighting to make Alaska a great State. It is a great State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would not be the State it is without your leadership, Ted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I want to say the most important thing I think you could say about anyone you know; that is, those who know him best love him most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you.</paragraph>
