  <narrative>SUPPORT GROWING DOMESTIC ENERGY NEEDS -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5489]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, an 83-year-old woman told me she is paying over $400 a month now for her energy bills, and she may end up finishing her life burning wood, like she started it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, God has blessed this Nation with an abundance of solutions in the form of natural resources that can support growing domestic energy needs. Within 3 years, we can get a million to a million and a half barrels of oil from ANWR. Some have indicated there are three times the amount of oil left in the entire Middle East, three times that amount in shale in Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, but they can't get to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The limited areas that are available for lease have an 8-year lease, and they are saying it takes right at 8 years to get all the permits. Yes, there is some property under lease that they can't produce. There is some that doesn't produce. That's the energy business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we need to help hardworking Americans. I don't understand what the majority leadership has against good union jobs. We are losing them every day in our district because energy prices are too high, and I want to keep those good union jobs.</paragraph>
