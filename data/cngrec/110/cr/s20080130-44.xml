  <narrative>
    <bill type="sr" number="437">S. Res. 437</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have exerted very large demands on the Treasury of the United States and required tremendous sacrifice by the members of the Armed Forces of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Congress has a constitutional responsibility to ensure comprehensive oversight of the expenditure of United States Government funds;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas waste and corporate abuse of United States Government resources are particularly unacceptable and reprehensible during times of war;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the magnitude of the funds involved in the reconstruction of Afghanistan  and Iraq and the war on terrorism, together with the speed with which these funds have been committed, presents a challenge to the effective performance of the traditional oversight function of Congress and the auditing functions of the executive branch;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program, popularly know as the Truman Committee, which was established during World War II, offers a constructive precedent for bipartisan oversight of wartime contracting that can also be extended to wartime and postwar reconstruction activities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Truman Committee is credited with an extremely successful investigative effort, performance of a significant public education role, and achievement of fiscal savings measured in the billions of dollars; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the public has a right to expect that taxpayer resources will be carefully disbursed and honestly spent: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1.

  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="SENATE RESOLUTION 437--ESTABLISHING A SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE TO INVESTIGATE THE AWARDING AND CARRYING OUT OF CONTRACTS TO CONDUCT ACTIVITIES IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ AND TO FIGHT THE WAR ON TERRORISM">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am going to be introducing legislation--I have previously introduced this--that deals with the construction in the Congress of what is called a Truman Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, President Truman was from the home State of the Presiding Officer and the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee on the floor. So the two Senators from Missouri, of course, I know harbor great pride in Harry Truman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the interesting things about Truman's tenure here in Washington, DC was not just his service in the Senate and not just him being President, but one of the sources of pride was his stewardship of something called the Truman Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when a President of his own party was in power in the White House, he and the Congress created a committee here in the Senate to take a look at waste, fraud, and abuse in contracting, particularly in the military. It cost him $15,000 to start it. Estimates are they saved $15 billion--in dollars from that time. Think of that: $15,000 to start the committee and saved $15 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now I know there are some who will disagree, but I happen to think it is long past time for us to be far more aggressive to find out what is happening to all this money. I will give you a couple of examples. One I have used a lot--I shall not today--by bringing a towel to the floor of the Senate, but I have held up a towel that Henry Bunting brought. He was a buyer for Kellogg, Brown, and Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton. He was a buyer stationed in Kuwait. One of the things he was to do was  buy hand towels for American soldiers. So he filed out the order for hand towels. His supervisor saw it and said: No, we are not going to buy those hand towels; we are going to buy hand towels with the initials of our company embroidered on the hand towels, KBR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said: Well, that will almost triple the cost. He was told: That does not matter; this is a cost-plus contract. The American taxpayer is going to pick up that tab.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So they ordered the towels that cost four or five times more. It did not matter; the taxpayers pick up the tab. That little towel is a very small reminder of what has been going on and how much the taxpayer has been fleeced. There is so much more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why do we need to track these things? Well, Paul Mullinax is a good reason. I called Paul Mullinax one Sunday. He was a truck driver in Florida. Here is what Paul Mullinax did. This is a good example of contracting in FEMA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Mullinax drives a refrigerated 18-wheeler. He was in Florida. He got a call from FEMA when Hurricane Katrina hit. They needed ice down in the Gulf of Mexico. So Paul Mullinax, God bless him, drove up, and he picked up some ice in New York for a FEMA contract; picked up a load of ice in his refrigerated truck. They said: Take it to Carthage, MO. This is ice that is destined for the Gulf of Mexico for the relief of the Katrina victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He drove his truck from New York to Carthage, MO; got there, they said: No, you are not supposed to be in Carthage, MO; you are supposed to be in Montgomery, AL. So he turned his truck south and east and went to Montgomery, AL. When he got there, he said there were over 100 18-wheel trucks. They had him park. He sat there for about 12 days with his refrigerated unit running on his truck. After about 12 or so days they sent him to Gloucester, MA, to offload his ice. This is ice destined for victims  of Katrina. He picked it up in New York, went to Carthage, went to Alabama, and then they said: Offload it in a warehouse in Massachusetts, 15,000 bucks for that truckload of ice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were another 100 18-wheelers sitting where he was sitting. Should somebody ask questions and say: Who on Earth is responsible for this? The answer is yes. Waste, fraud, and abuse in contracting is epidemic. It is unbelievable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Connected to the Katrina issue, this is a photograph, of course, of 8,420 brandnew, never-used FEMA trailers clogging an unused airport. The question is: Who made that decision and why? Were there any consequences as a result of this decision? I do not know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is money wrapped in Saran Wrap. Hundred dollar bills. This guy, by the way, told me--this is in a basement in Baghdad. This guy told me that they wrapped this money in Saran Wrap and occasionally threw it around like a football because it is about the size of a football--I have never wrapped hundred dollar bills. I have never seen that many hundred dollar bills. But if you wrap hundred dollar bills in Saran Wrap, I guess that is what it looks like. He said they actually threw them around  like footballs in that room in Baghdad. The reason these were wrapped in Saran Wrap, with some rubber bands around them, is because this guy was in charge of distributing the money. He said we were paying contractors and subcontractors in Iraq, and our motto was: We pay in cash; you bring a bag.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This payment happened to be a $2 million payment. We pay in cash, so bring a bag. He said it was just like the Wild West.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Question: Who is watching over all of this? Who is tracing it all? There is, I think, substantial evidence, with the release just 2 days ago of the Special Inspector General for Iraq, and another report, if you go through all of those reports, not just with Iraq, go through the reports on Katrina, and so many other similar examples, there is, I think, substantial evidence to lead one to conclude this is the greatest waste, fraud, and abuse in the history of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Harry Truman, at a time when there was substantial concern about that, was able to get a select or special committee created here in the Congress, bipartisan; cost $15,000 to create, they saved $15 billion. Pretty successful. It ought to happen again. I am going to introduce legislation today, once again. We have voted on it several times previously. I propose that we once again create a Truman Committee, a bipartisan committee to investigate waste, fraud, and abuse, and on behalf of the American  taxpayer say: This cannot continue. This has to stop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to make a longer presentation at some point, but I wanted to simply indicate that there is so much that needs to be done on this issue, and my hope is that at last, at long, long last, this Senate will adopt a select committee or a special committee similar to the Truman Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If ever the American taxpayer deserved good Government, it is now, with something like this in which we can begin to unravel who got what and how we stop this from happening again.</paragraph>
