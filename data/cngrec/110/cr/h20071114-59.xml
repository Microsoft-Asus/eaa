    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute simply to explain to the House that the intention is to have one remaining speaker on each side and then proceed to the votes.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400439" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, throughout the evening, we have heard some very, very interesting speeches. I listened with great respect to all of them. I agreed with some, I disagreed with some, I wasn't sure about some. Nevertheless, it was a good debate at a high level. I paid special attention to the very distinguished Speaker of the House because in her opening comments, she talked about how Monday, Veterans Day, America honored our veterans. She spoke about the Veterans appropriations bill in great, glowing  terms. I agree with that. It is a really good bill. It provides a lot of benefits for the veterans. There are 400,000 veterans claims backed up. That bill provided money to hire additional adjudicators to get rid of that backlog and get the veterans what they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is that as she spoke about the importance of this bill and what a great bill it was and great bill it is, she failed to say that the House passed it on June 15, the Senate passed it in September, and here we are in November still waiting to get that bill on the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say, Madam Speaker, let's vote on the VA appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mentioned the fact that there were great speeches. But, Mr. Speaker, tonight we will not be voting or be recorded on how those speeches went, or what those speeches said, or what those speeches included. We are not going to be voting on opinions. We are not going to be voting on politics. We are going to be voting on what is in this bill. What has been said about this bill is not necessarily what is actually written in the bill. But we are going to vote for what is written in that bill. We  will be held accountable for our vote on what that bill says, not on what some speaker said about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things that I mentioned in my opening comments that I was really offended by is that this legislation gives constitutional protection to terrorists, the same constitutional protection that all of our constituents enjoy. I refer to page 3 of the bill itself, "Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the rights under the United States Constitution of any person in the custody or under the physical jurisdiction of the United States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, that gives terrorists the same protection that your constituents have. And that's just not right. By giving them that protection, do we give them for example, do we have to read them their Miranda rights if we capture them on the battlefield? Do we have to allow them to pay bail and get out of jail or get out of detention? What kind of rights will we be giving to terrorists with just this one sentence that says they shall have rights under the Constitution? These are terrorists, Mr. Speaker.  These aren't even people who are signatories to the Geneva Convention. They don't play by any rules. They do whatever they must do, and they have killed thousands and thousands of Americans, and they have killed thousands and thousands of the Muslim populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, something about this bill, on page 6 of this bill, "After the conclusion of the reduction and transition of United States Armed Forces to a limited presence as required by this section, the Secretary of Defense may deploy or maintain members of the Armed Forces in Iraq only for the following missions." Now, pay attention to this because this is what you will be allowing. For those of you that think you're getting troops out of Iraq, this is what this bill will permit. The Armed Forces  in Iraq can be there for the following missions: "Protecting United States diplomatic facilities, United States Armed Forces, and American citizens." We do that now. That is one of the things that we are doing right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So you think you're getting out of that. This bill keeps you in that. The next paragraph, "Conducting limited training, equipment, and providing logistical and intelligence support to the Iraqi Security forces." We're doing that now. So if you think this bill is going to change anything, it doesn't because you are allowing them to stay  to do the same thing that they are doing now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next paragraph, "Engaging in targeted counterterrorism operations against al Qaeda, al Qaeda affiliated groups, and other terrorist organizations in Iraq." Mr. Speaker, we're doing that now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On page 12, we go to the Iraqi Security Forces Fund provided in this bill. "For the `Iraq Security Forces Fund', $500 million, Provided, that such funds shall be available to the Secretary of Defense, notwithstanding any other provision of law, for the purpose of allowing the Commander, Multinational Security Transition Command-Iraq, or the Secretary's designee, to provide assistance, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, to the security forces of Iraq." Mr. Speaker, we are doing  that now. So if you think we're making a change here, read the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It goes on to say, "Including the provision of equipment, supplies, services, training, facility and infrastructure repair, renovation, and construction, and funding, and to provide training, reintegration, education and employment programs for concerned local citizens, former militia members and detainees and former detainees." Mr. Speaker, we're doing all that now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this bill doesn't make very many changes if you think this gets you out of Iraq. It doesn't. If you read the bill, you will see that it doesn't. Now, these are things that we would be allowed to do under this bill. But if this bill were successful, and it will not be because I have an idea the President would veto it in its present form, we would have to do all of these same things that we are doing today but with a smaller force, a smaller force, minus the surge, for example. The change in  policy that we all demanded early on came about, and it was called the "surge." The surge has had many positive effects. When you get to the point that The New York Times and the L.A. Times and the Washington Post are writing stories about the positive effects of the surge, you have to admit there is something real there in the surge. So do you want to go back and have to do all of the same things we are doing today with a smaller force? I don't think so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will have a motion to recommit. And if that motion to recommit is successful, we will have a bill that we can all vote for and that I believe the President would be willing to sign. So let's vote based on what is in this bill, not what the speeches say about it, not about the politics, not about the opinions, but let's actually vote on what is in this bill and let's support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and anywhere else in the world where they might be deployed. We owe them no less.  This bill is not a good bill today. Let's vote against it tonight and vote for the motion to recommit.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400403" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker and Members, I rise in strong support of the bill that is before us today. First and foremost, I want to point out that every Member on this floor, every Member knows that the brave men and women of our military have done a fantastic job, and every Member on this floor supports the brave men and women serving our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, too many of those brave men and women have been doing a fantastic job for way too many tours. Multiple tours. The last time I was in Iraq, I had lunch with a group of soldiers from California, one of whom was a firefighter from the North Bay in California, and he said, I used to have a house in your district, but I don't anymore. My ex-wife has it now. I said, I am sorry to hear that. He said, well, this is my fourth tour. I couldn't expect much else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our men and women have been put under a tremendous strain for far too long. Our military equipment has been depleted. Over $100 billion is needed to bring our military equipment up to standard. Our combat readiness has been depleted. This bill, this bill is about refocusing our area; to transition, transition our effort into force protection, diplomatic protection, counterterrorism, refocus our effort looking into the future for future problems that we may have. It's long past time to refocus  our efforts; it's long past time to transition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does represent a change. We heard from the previous speaker that there wasn't much change. Mr. Speaker and Members, if there wasn't any change in this bill, we wouldn't be facing the opposition from the other side that we are facing tonight. This bill represents major change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill represents a policy change that the American people are demanding. They demanded it in the November election; they demand it today. It's long past time for this transition to take place. This war can't go on forever. We know that on this side of the aisle and we know it on the other side of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of comparisons have been made tonight with Vietnam. I want to make just one. I served in Vietnam with the 173rd Airborne Brigade. I didn't do anything exceptional. I showed up; I did my job. But there came a time in past Congresses that it was known that we were going to leave Vietnam, and from the time that we knew that our colleagues, our past colleagues knew that we were going to leave Vietnam, until we actually left Vietnam, 21,000 Americans died.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They knew, our colleagues in past Congresses knew that we couldn't sustain that. We weren't going to be in Vietnam forever. They knew we had to leave. From the time they absolutely knew it on this floor until we left, 21,000 brave American men died in Vietnam. I was one of the lucky ones. I was only wounded. I lost a lot of friends. We lost a lot of fellow Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot make that same mistake. We know that the Iraq war cannot go on forever. We know that on both sides of the aisle. It's time for a major policy change. This bill represents that major policy change. I urge everyone to vote "aye" for the underlying bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, after my oversight trips to Iraq in July and August of 2006, I concluded we needed to encourage the Iraqi government, and specifically Prime Minister Maliki, to take stronger action to improve the situation in their country, and that the best way to do this was to set firm timelines for Iraqi security forces to replace our troops who are doing police work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe a workable timeline will incentivize the Iraqis to make the hard choices necessary to ensure stability among the three primary sects--Sunnis, Shias, and Kurds. We need to motivate the Iraqis to set firm deadlines for provincial elections, reconciliation and amnesty, and a final drafting of their constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During 2005, Iraqis set timelines to establish and ratify a constitution and hold national elections. They accomplished each benchmark successfully. I do not believe they would have achieved this success if we had not pushed Sunnis, Shias, and Kurds to resolve their differences and compromise in order to meet the timelines we helped set.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States went into Iraq on a bipartisan basis, with two-thirds of the House and three-quarters of the Senate voting to authorize the use of force. I believe we need to draw down the majority of our troops on a bipartisan basis, and have sought to achieve bipartisan solutions to improve our operations and reduce the violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While <bill type="h" number="4156">H.R. 4156</bill> is by no means a perfect solution, it does propose a tight, but arguably reasonable, timeline for drawdown of troops in Iraq similar to one I proposed earlier this year. It should help bridge the gap between Republicans and Democrats on the most important issue of our time. The bill would require our commanders to begin a redeployment of our troops in harms way within a month, and set a target date of December 15, 2008, to complete the task.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For me, a better bill would have been to give Iraqis and our troops an additional six months to complete the drawdown, but given this bill sets a target date, rather than a withdrawal date, it gives needed flexibility to our military leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not believe we have the force structure to maintain the number of troops in Iraq now, and certainly do not have the capacity to increase the force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our troops have performed extraordinarily well, but it is unreasonable for us to ask them to return to Iraq for a third or fourth tour. I also believe it was a significant mistake to extend  their tours from 12 to 15 months and would be unconscionable to consider extending their tours beyond 15 months. Based on our military's current manpower, we will need to begin to draw down our forces by the beginning of 2008, and it would be wise to let the Iraqis  know now this reduction will take place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I support this bill, I am disappointed the majority still has not allowed a single amendment on any Iraq-related bill. As I have said before, it is pretty arrogant to think we would criticize Iraqis for not being able to compromise and find common ground when Republicans and Democrats are unable to compromise and find common ground on the most important issue facing our Nation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to call for the passage of <bill type="h" number="4156">H.R. 4156</bill>, the "Orderly and Responsible Iraq Redeployment Act." The war in Iraq cannot be won through the use of military force or another troop surge. The majority of the American people do not support the war in Iraq; a recent study stated that nearly 7 in 10 Americans oppose the war. Since the war began in 2003, 3,859 brave U.S. troops have died in Iraq. In 2007 the death toll has already reached 860 soldiers who have lost  their lives, making it the worst year yet for the American military in Iraq. Currently, 28,400 soldiers have been wounded in Iraq since the war began with 12,750 suffering injuries so serious they were prevented from returning to duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush's failed Iraq policies offer a war with no end in sight. There is no progress on political reconciliation between Shiites and Sunnis in the Iraqi government. Just this week, it was reported that the U.S. effort to organize nearly 70,000 local Sunni fighters to solidify security gains in Iraq is facing severe political and logistical challenges as the central government resists in incorporating them into the Iraqi police and army. Last month, the Shiite political alliance of Prime  Minister Nouri al-Maliki called the U.S. military to halt the recruitments of Sunnis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill in the house tonight will require the start of the redeployment of U.S. forces within 30 days of enactment, with a goal completion of redeployment by December 15, 2008. It will require a transition in the mission of U.S. forces in Iraq from primarily combat to force protection and diplomatic protection; limited support to Iraqi security forces; and targeted counterterrorism operations. <bill type="h" number="4156">H.R. 4156</bill> will prohibit deployment of U.S. troops to Iraq who are not fully trained and fully equipped.  The legislation also calls for an extension to all U.S. Government agencies and personnel of the current prohibitions in the Army Field Manual against torture. The bill will also provide to meet the immediate need of our troops, but defers consideration of the remainder of the President's nearly $200 billion request. At the current rate of expenditure, the additional funds will last 4 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many insist that American troops cannot leave Iraq until we have achieved victory; and democracy has been established. History has shown us that civil wars and insurgencies are ended only through rigorous diplomacy, economic development, and national reconciliation between former enemies; not by a troop surge and an endless war. Diplomacy works, and now more then ever is the time to implement the recommendations of the Baker Hamilton Commission, and call for a regional peace summit in the Middle  East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's bring all parties who are involved in the conflict to the peace table, so they can begin to resolve their differences. If international diplomacy ended the intractable conflicts in Northern Ireland, the Balkans, the conflict between Israel and Egypt, and Rwanda; then international diplomacy can work in Iraq. Once we begin the strategic withdrawal of U.S. troops out of Iraq, and show the Iraqi people we do not wish to occupy their country, then and only then can we begin the real possibility  of having an effective international peace conference.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400238" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the issue before the House today is straightforward. Do we think the President's Iraq policy is working so well that we should give him another $200 billion to continue it, or do we need a fundamental change in direction?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I truly believe we need to change an Iraq policy that is simply not working. From the beginning, the Bush administration has been wrong about the war in Iraq. If you set aside the administration's rhetoric, the reality is that the surge has not worked. The goal of the surge was to give the Iraqi Government breathing space to make the political decisions necessary to reduce the violence that is tearing Iraq apart. But 11 months into the troop surge, progress on political reconciliation continues  to be all but nonexistent. Meanwhile, 2007 has already been the deadliest year for American troops since the start of the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a clear choice before us. If you are satisfied with how the Bush administration has been conducting the war for the last 4 1/2  years, you should oppose this bill. If, on the other hand, you believe the administration's strategy isn't working and want to require the President to change course, you should vote for this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whatever small chance there is of the Iraqi factions coming together, it will not happen as long as the U.S. military commitment in Iraq remains open-ended. We need to change course.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400057" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the majority party's Iraq supplemental appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is baffling that at the precise moment when the surge in Iraq is producing positive results, the majority party would like to pull the rug out from underneath our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Violence is down. Sunnis in al Anbar have allied with U.S. forces against al Qaeda. Baghdad is regaining some sense of normalcy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By no means can we declare "victory" but our troops can rightfully claim progress. Despite these positive developments, the majority party wants to withdraw our forces--as if the enemy won't follow us home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: are they prepared to take responsibility for the disastrous consequences of an early withdrawal?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Are they prepared to witness the chaos and destruction in Iraq?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most importantly, are they willing to pass this responsibility on to the next generation of Americans who may be forced to finish the job we did not have the courage to complete?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues are right: we have made a significant financial and personal investment in Iraq. Let us have the courage of our convictions to see it through.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to reject this bill and pass a clean supplemental bill that provides support to those who are fighting and dying. We owe them that much.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400415" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Iraq Redeployment Act which sets forth a realistic strategy for the responsible redeployment of our combat troops in Iraq. The Bush Administration has requested another $200 billion dollar blank check for the war in Iraq to pursue a flawed strategy that has no end in sight and which continually puts our brave men and women in the armed services in the middle of Iraq's civil war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The indefinite presence of American forces in Iraq has allowed the different factions there to postpone making the difficult compromises necessary to achieve stability and political reconciliation. Our intelligence community has publicly concluded that the political situation in Iraq is getting worse, not better. We cannot ask our troops to remain in Iraq when the different Iraqi factions have refused to take the steps necessary to achieve a greater stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must embark on a new direction in Iraq. That's what this legislation will do. It allocates $50 billion for the purpose of beginning to responsibly redeploy our combat forces out of Iraq by the target date of December 15, 2008. The troops that would remain in Iraq beyond that date would focus on the more limited missions of training Iraqi security forces, providing logistical and intelligence support for the Iraqi security forces, and engaging in targeted counter-terrorist operations against  Al-Qaeda and affiliated groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the legislation states, "the primary purpose of funds made available by the Act should be to transition the mission of the United States Armed Forces in Iraq and undertake their redeployment, and not to extend or prolong the war." This bill also states that the reduction of our armed forces in Iraq "shall be implemented in conjunction with a comprehensive diplomatic, political and economic strategy that includes sustained engagement with Iraq's neighbors and the international community  for the purpose of working collectively to bring stability to Iraq"--a strategy recommended by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group that the Administration has failed to pursue with any vigor or urgency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also prohibits the deployment of any troops not fully equipped or trained, and extends to all U.S. Government agencies and personnel the limitations in the U.S. Army Field Manual on permissible interrogation techniques. We must send a strong message to the world that we do not support or condone torture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are on the wrong path in Iraq. This bill provides a much needed change in direction that will strengthen our national security, improve our position in the region and bring our men and women safely home.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400166" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, one need look no further than the chaos in Pakistan or the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan to understand that troop levels in Iraq cannot be maintained--and that the surge, which I have always opposed, has done nothing to achieve political stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, with this bridge funding vote, Congress signals to the White House yet again that enough is enough, that the combat mission in Iraq must end, and that we will force that change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one in this chamber questions the courage or commitment of our brave women and men in uniform or their willingness to tackle  any challenge put before them. But we have sent them on an ill-defined mission with no apparent end point, and which consumes staggering amounts of our talent and treasure at the expense of countless other priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also redresses a glaring loophole in the Military Commissions Act--a bill I strongly opposed. By requiring that all U.S. Government agencies and personnel must adhere to interrogation techniques contained in the Army Field Manual, we send an unmistakable signal to the rest of the world that the United States--the world's oldest functioning democracy--does not permit cruel, inhumane and degrading practices, or torture, and complies fully with Federal law banning torture and our international  obligations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Iraq Troop Redeployment Bill is good policy, and long overdue.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400253" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="4156">H.R. 4156</bill>, the Orderly and Responsible Iraq Redeployment Appropriations Act. This bill will begin the long-overdue withdrawal of American troops from Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, the President vetoed the Labor and Heath and Human Services-Education appropriations bill, which is the bill that provides funding for the National Institutes of Health, the Center for Disease Control, Low Income Home Energy Assistance, the Education Department, Pell Grants, and educational programs for the disadvantaged. He vetoed this bill because it contained a 2 percent increase over his request--an increase of $10 billion in a Labor HHS bill of roughly $600 billion. The President  opposes even a 2 percent increase in the funding for these programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, the President has requested almost $200 billion more for his failed war in Iraq. That would make the total cost of the war in Iraq so far to over $600 billion and climbing, with no end in sight. President Bush's refusal to change course in Iraq is shocking, his failure to allow adequate rest for our soldiers between tours of duty is outrageous, and his demand for another $200 billion blank check for his war in Iraq while vetoing LIHEAP for the poor, education for disadvantaged children,  Pell Grants for college students, and research into cures for life threatening disease is simply unacceptable to this House. What a misplaced set of priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of the blank check for an endless war, this bill requires President Bush to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq within 30 days. Instead of unfairly sending inadequately equipped soldiers on multiple tours of duty, this bill prohibits the deployment of any troops who are not fully equipped and trained. And at the same time, this bill provides the necessary funds, in full, to our troops who are still in harm's way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Republican colleagues must make a choice: will they stand with President Bush's attempt to throw more money and more young men and women into the mess in Iraq, or will they join with Democrats seeking a bipartisan agreement on redeploying American troops out of Iraq?</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Mr. Speaker, I would like to specifically note a provision of this bill, which I wrote, to bar any funds in this bill from being used for the gruesome and indefensible practice of extraordinary rendition. I would like to commend and thank Chairman OBEY and Chairman MURTHA for again including this language, as they have in every defense appropriations and supplemental appropriations bill this year. Through the use of extraordinary rendition, as well as abusive interrogation techniques  and extrajudicial incarceration of so-called "enemy combatants," President Bush has largely forfeited the mantel of human rights champion which the United States has carried for so long. We must reclaim the international moral high-ground if we are to cure the root causes of terrorism around the world, and we can start by banning extraordinary rendition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend Chairman OBEY for this strong and responsible bill, and urge all my colleagues to vote aye.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="4156">H.R. 4156</bill>, the Orderly and Responsible Iraq Redeployment Appropriations Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Iraq war is a failure and it's time for our troops to come home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill calls for a responsible redeployment and provides for the checks and balances Congress is authorized to impose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration does not have blanket authority and America does not have a bottomless checking account.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Our military presence in Iraq is not making our country any safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, this war has taken the lives of over 3,850 soldiers, including 13 brave young men from my District alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From Rialto, 37-year-old Staff Sergeant Jorge A. Molina was deployed in Iraq and died in hostile fire in the Anbar province.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>From Bloomington, 25-year-old, Corporal Joseph A. Blanco was deployed in Iraq and died by small arms fire in Taji after sustaining injuries from a makeshift bomb.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From Fontana, 19-year-old Lance Corporal Fernando S. Tamayo was deployed in Iraq and died while conducting combat operations in Anbar Province.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From Fontana, 24-year-old Sergeant Bryan A. Brewster was deployed in Afghanistan and died after his helicopter crashed during combat operations in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From San Bernardino, 22-year-old Corporal Nicanor Alvarez was deployed in Iraq and died in the line of fire in the Anbar province.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From San Bernardino, 19-year-old Petty Officer Alex Oceguera was deployed in Afghanistan, and died when a makeshift bomb detonated near his vehicle in Wygal Valley, Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From San Bernardino, 24-year-old Corporal Sean Grilley was deployed in Iraq, and died after being fired on by Iraqis during operations in Karbala.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From San Bernardino, 24-year-old Specialist Timothy D. Watkins was deployed in Iraq, and died when a makeshift bomb exploded near his vehicle during operations in Ar Ramadi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From Ontario, 21-year-old Specialist Jose R. Perez was deployed in Iraq, and died by enemy small arms fire in Ramadi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From Ontario, 31-year-old Sergeant First Class Rudy A. Salcido was deployed in Iraq, and died when an improvised explosive device detonated near his convey vehicle in Baghdad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the true faces of the war. My deepest prayers go out to their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These soldiers are the reason why I am so adamant about bringing our troops back home, and why we must support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's failed policies on the Iraqi war effort must end. We are listening to America's concerns and will not stand by and watch this continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to bring back our loved ones and put our families here at home first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time for America to put her priorities in order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Nation is in debt, but not because of domestic spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush refuses to sign bills to pay for schools, children's health care, and to protect our workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, he comes to us asking for another $200 billion to continue funding the Iraq war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With just one week's worth of funding for the war, my District would never again face a shortage of teachers, of nurses, or of police officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a veteran, I voted against this war in 2002 because no one could convince me why we had to be there in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President believes Iraq is making our country safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth is, it is has put us at greater risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our military is stretched so thin that we are at risk of not being prepared for any future emergencies.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Clerk will report the motion to recommit.</chair>
  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. YOUNG of Florida moves to recommit the bill, <bill type="h" number="4156">H.R. 4156</bill>, to the Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendments:</narrative>
  <narrative>(1) In section 101--</narrative>
  <narrative>(A) strike paragraph (3);</narrative>
  <narrative>(B) in paragraph (1), insert "and" after the semicolon; and</narrative>
  <narrative>(C) in paragraph (2), strike "; and" and insert a period.</narrative>
  <narrative>(2) Strike sections 102, 104 and 106.</narrative>
  <narrative>(3) In section 105--</narrative>
  <narrative>(A) strike subsections (a) through (f); and</narrative>
  <narrative>(B) in subsection (g), strike the subsection designation.</narrative>
  <narrative>(4) Redesignate sections 103 and 105 as sections 102 and 103 respectively.</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400439" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit is a simple forthwith motion. That means a vote for this motion will allow the House to immediately vote tonight on a bill that can pass the Congress and be signed into law. That means that our troops in harm's way will get the funding they need before Congress leaves town for a 2-week Thanksgiving recess.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The motion would amend the bill to strike the provisions which have nothing to do with providing for our troops and are nothing more than political gamesmanship. The motion would strip the provisions that give our enemies a complete blueprint and timeline for troop withdrawal. The motion would strip the provisions in the bill which signal to our troops and our enemies that Congress will not provide any more funding for our troops, except for withdrawal. The motion would strip the provisions in  the bill that substitute politicians' judgments on troop deployment for the judgment of our military commanders in the field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, we leave intact the $50 billion in critical funding included in the bill. We leave intact the prohibition on torture, which has been adopted previously by this Congress and Congresses before. But we strip the new provisions which could give terrorists killing our soldiers and our citizens constitutional protections under our legal system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We modify provisions to more clearly express Congress's commitment to our troops and to bringing them home safely in victory as soon as possible. We leave intact a new requirement that the President submit to the Congress within the next 3 months a comprehensive, long-term strategy to achieve stability in the Middle East over the next 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As events of the last few months have shown, the situation on the ground has, and we all hope will, continue to improve dramatically. Congress has and will continue to debate the proper course of the war, as it should. However, we should not and cannot vote to hold troop funding hostage to that debate. The only ones hurt by that are our troops and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we go home to enjoy the holidays with our families, how can any of us look our soldiers' families in the eye and explain to them that we are withholding their funding so that we can score political points. That is just wrong. Our soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen and their families deserve more from all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge adoption of this motion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Who wishes to claim the time in opposition?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I certainly do.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, everyone knows that I have a great deal of affection for the gentleman from Florida. I think he makes as good an argument for a bad case as you can possibly find. Let me simply say that this recommittal motion is very easy to understand, which is why it ought to be defeated. It simply gives the President all the money in this bill, unconditionally. It is simply a down payment on business as usual. It simply strips the timeline from this legislation. It renews the authority  for torture. It eliminates the requirement that interrogation activities follow the Army Field Manual. Outside of those problems, it's a terrific idea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would simply urge a "no" vote on the motion to recommit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400286" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>I want the Members to know I carry in my pocket the names of 18 people who have been killed from my district. Two years ago, I said this is a failed policy wrapped in illusion. I am absolutely convinced that there's more instability in the Middle East today than there was then.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This recommittal motion works against everything we are trying to do. We want a plan. We want a plan in Iraq. We want stability in the Middle East. We don't have stability. Pakistan, Afghanistan, and of course Turkey might even go into the Middle East. So when you talk about victory, you're talking about stability, which we don't have. It's absolutely essential to put a plan in place that holds the President accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All this time the President has asked for things and we have given them to him. For 5 years we have said to the President of the United States, You need money, we are going to give to it you. Now we are saying we are going to have a new plan, and that plan is going to change the direction of this war, and we are going to bring those troops who fought so honorably home to their families.</paragraph>
