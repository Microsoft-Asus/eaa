  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will vote later today in relation to two bills I recently introduced with Majority Leader REID addressing the war in Iraq and the disastrous toll it continues to take on our top national s ecurity priority, the global fight against al-Qaida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of my colleagues have expressed concern that the exhausting rate of deployments in Iraq and the resources we are committing to that country are undermining our ability to protect ourselves at home and respond to dangers abroad, including the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan and the global threat posed by al-Qaida. While we all hope that the recent decline in violence in Iraq will hold, lasting stability remains elusive and there is a seriou s danger that our troops will remain mired</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator REID and I have introduced two bills to address these problems head-on. One of these bills, <bill type="s" number="2633">S. 2633</bill>, is similar to legislation we have offered before. I am pleased that this bill is also cosponsored by Senators BOXER, BROWN, BYRD, CARDIN, CLINTON, DODD, DURBIN, HARKIN, LEAHY, MENENDEZ, OBAMA, SANDERS, SCHUMER, WHITEHOUSE, and WYD EN. It requires the President to safely redeploy U.S. combat troops from Iraq with very narrow exceptions. Effective 120 days from enactment</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there is no end date for redeployment, then (what is to stop the administration keeping troops there indefinitely? The answer is that, after 120 days, troops can only remain in Iraq for the narrowly defined purposes in the bill. Because these exceptions are so narrow, the bill removes any incentive for the President to delay or "slow walk" redeployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, some on the other side are arguing that this new bill is tougher than previous versions, because the funding rest riction kicks in sooner, in 120 days. Of course, these are the same people who oppose any limitations on the war, so I don't take their arguments too seriously. I suspect they haven't actually read the new bill, or they would realize that the bill is quite a bit more flexible, for the reasons I just mentioned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, the administration is considering various "drawdown" plans, all of which would leave well over 100,000 troops in Iraq through the end of the year. That would continue to require an ex hausting rate of deployments that we simply cannot afford--for our military readiness, our fiscal bottom line, and our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This administration has put Iraq first for too long. In an effort to refocus our national priorities, the second bill Senator REID and I have introduced with Senators BOXER, BROWN, BYRD, CARDIN, CASEY, CLINTON, DODD, HARKIN, LAUTENBERG, LEAHY, MENENDEZ, OBAMA, SCHUMER, and WHITE-HOUSE, would require the administration to come up with a strategy to wage  a comprehensive, global campaign against al-Qaida, without undermining our military readiness. The legislation, <bill type="s" number="2634">S. 2634</bill>,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the information called for in this bill will probably need to be contained in a classified annex. But there is no reason the administration cannot also pr ovide a public report identifying in broad terms the threat we face and how to respond to it. The American public should be kept as informed as  possible about how we are protecting them from the number one threat we face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know some of my colleagues do not want to be talking about Iraq again. I know some of them complain that we spent too much time debating Iraq last year and I know some of them have concerns about whether now is the right time to bring these bills up for a vote. But we cannot a llow the focus on Iraq to fade because violence has declined in parts of Iraq. It is true violence levels are down to where they were in 2005, but Iraq is still extremely and unacceptably violent, as it was in 2005. Violence</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, the surge has not brought Iraq any closer to legitimate political reconciliation at the national lev el--and it may, in fact, have undermined the prospects for such reconciliation in the long term. The President's policies have empowered former insurgents and militia-infiltrated security forces with questionable loyalties. By supporting sheiks in al Anbar--and elsewhere--we may have reduced violence in the near term, but only by making it more difficult to achieve national reconciliation</paragraph>
    <paragraph>them. Mr. President, we cannot, and should not, ask our brave men and women in uniform to resolve these sectarian disputes. Military ope rations are not a substitute for a viable political settlement, and the American people are simply not willing to leave our troops on the front lines indefinitely in hopes that some day such a settlement will arrive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recent gains in Iraq are tactical successes at best, devoid of an overarching strategy to integrate local powerbrokers into a broader national framework. Our presence has only added to the complexities in Iraq as we meddle in local dynamics and contribute to internal divisions and sectarian</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Keeping our troops in Iraq will not solve Iraq's problems, and it won't help us address the growing threat posed by al-Qaida around the world. It makes no sense to devote so many of our critical resources and s o much of our attention to one country, rather than to the global fight against al-Qaida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every year, I hold town hall meetings in each of the 72 counties of Wisconsin, and over the January and February recess I held some 30 meetings in some of the most conservative parts of the state. I didn't bring up Iraq at those January meetings because I wanted to see whether it was still a major concern, particularly with these audiences. And guess what, in every single meeting, they brought it up with me. And th ey didn't just bring it up, they asked what we are doing to bring home the troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They will be torn from their family, their jobs, their communities, to be put in harm's way, all in order to create space for a political reconciliation in Iraq that is always just over the horizon. The y will not be there to protect the people of Wisconsin in the event of an emergency, nor will they be reinforcing our troops in Afghanistan, who face what one recent report described as a "stalemate" in fighting al-Qaida's ally, the Taliban. Like Americans all across the country, the people</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This administration has been so distracted by Iraq</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While agreeing to provide 3,200 U.S. troops to Afghanistan, Secretary Gates has also requested  additional ground troops from our allies. If our allies are unwilling to provide those troops or worsening conditions require additional troops, it is far from clear that we will have the forces we need in Afghanistan without further undermining military readiness and homeland security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Across the Afghan border, in Pakistan, things are also looking bad. The Director of National Intelligence testified recently that "al-Qaida's central leadership based in the border area of Pakistan is al-Qaida's most da ngerous component." The DNI also said that since the middle of 2006, there has been an influx of "new Western recruits" into this part of the world, an indication that al-Qaida is "improving the last key aspect of its ability to attack the United States: the identification,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration has made matters worse by associating itself with an undemocratic, authoritarian regime in Pakistan, one that the Pakistani people, finally given the chance to make their voices heard, roundly rejected. In return for questionable anti-terrorism assistance, we have given the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our endless presence in Iraq is distracting us from these core threats to our national security. Instead of dancing around these vital concerns, we need to address them head on and that is why we need a strategy for defeating al-Qaida and its affiliates around the globe. We need a strategy which identifies the gravest threats to our national securit y and makes recommendations for addressing them with both military and nonmilitary initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know there is no silver bullet to defeat al-Qaida. But it has been made very clear to Congress, and to the American public that if we are to protect ourselves at home, there must be a dramatic shift in how we order our national priorities. We cannot continue with the current agenda. We must refocus not just so we have the capacity to respond to other contingencies abroad but also because our heavy footprint</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to rebuild our domestic response capability, which has been severely compromised by repeated deployments of our National Guard. As long as we keep over 100,000 troops in Iraq we will have to continue to deploy Guard units in a manner that compromises their ability to prepare for domestic incidents. Deployments to Iraq have left those responsible for protecting us at home with, on average, only 56 percent of the essential "dual-use" equipment needed to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, the National Guard Bureau estimates that it is facing a $47 billion equipment shortfall, including a $20 million shortfall in equipment needed to respond to a chemical, biological, or radiological incident at home, notwithstanding the fact that it is the stated intention of al-Qaida to pursue such weapons. The Commission on the National Guard and Reserves concluded that "[b]ecause our nation has not adequately resourced its forces designated for response to weap ons of mass destruction,</paragraph>

  <chair>The Commission characterized this as an "appalling gap." I wholeheartedly agree. This is unacceptable more than 6 years after 9/11, and is clear evidence that our national security priorities need to be reexamined and realigned.</chair>
  <chair>Rather than giving the National Guard the $47 billion it needs, the President has asked for another $100 billion for operations in Iraq in 2008 alone, in addition to the $86 billion we have already appropriated. If</chair>
  <chair>The Army Chief of Staff has stated that our current rate of deployment is unsustainable, and a recent survey of military officers found that 88 percent believe the demands of the Iraq war have "stretched the U.S. military dangerously thin."</chair>
  <chair>There are other costs to the war in Iraq, Mr. President, and they are considerable. The war is simultaneously deepening instability th roughout the Middle East, undermining the international support and cooperation we need to defeat al-Qaida, and providing al-Qaida and its allies with a rallying cry and recruiting tool.</chair>
  <chair>That is why I am offering, with Majority Leader REID, legislation to redeploy our troops and refocus our national priorities. It is our job to listen to the American people, to save American lives, and to protect our Nation's security by redeploying our troops from Iraq because the President will not.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am proud to rise in support of Senator Feingold's two bills. The first bill requires that the President begin the safe redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq within 120 days. There is no end date for redeployment. It only starts the redeployment. It includes e xceptions for missions against al-Qaida, force protection, and training. The second bill requires that the administration provide to Congress a full report outlining a comprehensive global strategy to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As someone who voted to go get bin Laden after 9/11, I am dismayed that this President has turned away from that mission and put so much into an ill-fated war in Iraq. Senator Feingold is proposing a policy for us that is consistent with common sense and our nationa l security because the war in Iraq has not made us safer. It has made us vulnerable. The war in Iraq has not reduced the influence of al-Qaida. Actually, it has made al-Qaida a hero, unfortunately. It has been seen as one</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are in a quagmire in Iraq. We are told that quagmire will go on indefini tely. I believe it is undermining our national security. It is undermining our economic security. When I tell you what it is costing, it is a stunning number. It has diverted critical resources from the hunt for Osama bin Laden. He has been at large more than 6 years. And despite the administration's rhetoric, our own intelligence agencies again are telling us that the war in Iraq is proving to be a critical recruitment</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We see a toll on our milita ry. We hear phrases such as a "death spiral." The Washington Post reported that Army and Marine officials refer to the readiness death spiral that senior officers warn puts our Nation at risk. Why? Because we lack the strategic reserve of ground forces to be able to respond to crises throughout the world. This single-minded focus on Iraq and the ever-changing mission there is not making us stronger. It is making us weaker. We now see that suicide attempts among U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once upon a time we were told that this Iraq war was about weapons of mass destruction that Sadda m Hussein was hiding, and it was about also Saddam's ties to al-Qaida. Our military did its job. They found out there weren't weapons of mass destruction, and our intelligence people did their job. They said there were no al-Qaida cells in Iraq at the time of 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we were told the war was about getting rid of Saddam and liberating Iraq from that brutal tyrant. Our military did that. Then we were told the war was about holding elections and promoting democracy. You remember President Bush in his fl ight suit with big words "mission accomplished." Well, there were many missions accomplished. There were no weapons of mass destruction. There were no ties to al-Qaida. We got Saddam Hussein. We got his relatives. Three elections were held. Our military</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Russ Feingold is saying: All right. We won't set an end date. We will change the mission to get our troops out of harm's way. Let them continue to train Iraqis. Let them go after al-Qaida. Let them protect our forces there and our personnel there. But get them  out of the business of kicking down doors in Iraq. We have lost so many of these brave men and women, and so many are coming home who will never be the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have this war based on shifting missions. The President said: Mission accomplished. Dick Cheney said we are in the last throes. But it goes on and on under shifting rationales, going on 5 long years. Will it be another 5 years? They will not tell us. Will it be another 10 years? They will not tell us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of this administration's suppo rters say it will be 50 years. Some say it will be 100 years. How many brave men and women will die in addition to those who have already died? How many will be wounded? There are no answers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Will we spend $1 trillion? Will we spend $2 trillion, $3 trillion? No answer. The toll is too high already. Thousands dead, tens of thousands injured, $10 billion a month for Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Nation's Governors met with the President yesterday. On a bipartisan basis they asked to see increased spending on America's cr umbling roads and highways and bridges. They said it would help our struggling economy, and we can't grow economically if we don't have an infrastructure. I am chair of the Public Works Committee of the Senate. My friend, Senator Inhofe, and I do not agree on the war in Iraq, but we certainly agree that we need to have an infrastructure. The President said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>equivalent to $2.5 billion a week, $357 million a day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For less than the cost of 3 months in Iraq, we could enroll every eligible child in America in the Head Start program for 1 long year. For the cost of 1 month in Iraq, we could provide afterschool care for our kids for 4 years. For the cost of 2 weeks in Iraq, we could provide health insuranc e for a year to 6 million uninsured kids. Last year we asked the President to help us with children's health. He said no. He vetoed that critical investment. He just said no to the Governors on rebuilding</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do you remember when the President's then-Budget Director, Mitch Daniels, told us the war in Iraq would cost no more than $60 billion? He was wrong. Paul Wolfowitz assured us Iraqi revenue would pay for the war. No, w e remember there were a couple in the administration who said the war might cost as much as $200 billion. They were ridiculed. The President's most recent supplemental request for Iraq was $200 billion in itself, bigger than the stimulus package we just passed. The President has</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cost of a barrel of oil has tripled since the war began, much to the benefit of countries such as Russia, Sudan, and Iran. According to the Joint Economic Committee, if you factor in the cost of the oil, the President's policy in Iraq has already cost the average family $416,500, and no end in sight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It needs to stop. We are hemorrhaging money. The waste in th is war is beyond disgraceful. We spent $32 million for a base in Iraq that was never built. We paid a contractor $72 million to build a barracks for the police academy in Baghdad and instead got a building with giant cracks snaking through newly built walls and human waste dripping from the ceiling. That is from a report. The administration loaded $9 billion in cash on to pallets and shipped it into Iraq where it promptly disappeared.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask you: Imagine what would happen if $9 billion disappeared from o ne of our cities. The people responsible would be in prison. But in Iraq, the President shrugs it off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the President vetoed the Water Resources Development Act, he said it lacked fiscal discipline. He said it wasn't fiscally responsible. I would ask rhetorically: Not fiscally responsible to maintain our waterways and keep our commerce moving in this, the greatest Nation in the world? This, coming from a President who inherited a budget surplus and turned it into a huge debt, with the largest budget</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our own military leaders tell us time and time again there is no military solution. God bless our soldiers. They have given us a breathing space. Yet the Iraqi Government is just making changes around the edges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have trained 440,000 Iraqis militarily. Imagine, 440,000 Iraqis. Why can't they defend themselves? Countries defend themselves. We have given so much in blood, in tears, in sweat, in dollars, in commitment, in trust. After the elections last year, I thought the Pres ident would come to the table when the Democrats took over and said we wanted to end the war. We thought he would come to the table. We were wrong. He did not come to the table. He is continuing this war, no end in sight, no plan</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I asked that question to Condoleezza Rice, I was stunned. She said: I can't answer the question of how long we will be there. I can't answer the question of what it will cost--as if I didn't have a right to ask the question. That is why I am sent here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rep resent, along with Senator Feinstein, 37 million people. We have taken a hit on soldiers killed. We have taken a hit on soldiers burned. We have taken a hit on soldiers permanently disabled. So you better know I am going to ask these questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Senator Feingold is saying: Let's get started. Let's start telling the Iraqis, by our actions not just our words, that they have to step up to the plate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to make a choice as a nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is it time for America? It is time for our families, for our soldiers, for our children, for our grandchildren?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Or is it time to continue this open-ended commitment to a war without an end, a war that has no plan of ever ending, a war that is tying our hands in this recession?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say it is time for a change in America. It is time to vote for the Feingold bill and start bringing our troops home.</paragraph>
