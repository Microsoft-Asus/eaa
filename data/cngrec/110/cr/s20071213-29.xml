    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the life and legacy of a great American who passed away last week--Casimir Lenard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cas Lenard was an American patriot, who also made a tremendous contribution to strengthening the friendship between the United States and Poland. He served bravely in three U.S. wars. He was a leader in the Polish American Community. He was also a beloved husband to the late Myra Lenard, his partner in life and his partner in his work on behalf of the Polish American community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cas Lenard was born in Chicago to a family of Polish immigrants. Like so many children of immigrants, Cas Lenard embraced his country while never forgetting his homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After hearing that the Nazis had invaded Poland in 1939, Cas joined the Chicago Black Horse Troop, 106th Cavalry, Illinois National Guard. Two years later, he requested and was assigned to the 1st U.S. Infantry Division--the first U.S. Army unit to go overseas. From 1942-1945, Cas was engaged in overseas combat duty, participating in the Operation Torch landing at Oran, North Africa, the invasion of Sicily, and in the D-Day amphibious landing at Omaha Beach, Normandy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After his discharge from the Army in 1945, Cas married his beloved wife, Myra, and began working in the family restaurant business in Chicago. Again heeding the call to service, Cas volunteered for active duty and served for 6 years during the Korean War. In 1962, he was selected for a 5-year tour of active duty with the General Staff at the Pentagon, where he became Chief of the Army Intelligence Reserve Office. Cas then went on to serve in Vietnam and at the U.S. Army Institute of Land Combat  at Ft. Belvoir, Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After 30 years of distinguished service, Cas retired from the military and was awarded many citations, including the Silver Star Medal with Cluster, the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Bronze Star Medal with "V" for Valor, the French Croix de Guerre with Palm, seven overseas campaign ribbons, and the Normandy Medal of the Jubilee of Liberty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I got to know Cas and Myra Lenard because of their work with the Polish American Congress--where Cas served as its first executive director in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cas and Myra worked tirelessly to support the Solidarity movement in Poland. And when the wall came down, Cas and Myra Lenard were strong advocates for Poland's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO. The Lenards were there every step of the way--organizing the Polish American community to educate their Senators about how Poland's membership in NATO would strengthen America's security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all of his efforts on behalf of Polish Americans and for improving Poland's position in the world, Cas received many awards, including the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland, the Founders Award by the Polish American Congress, and the Polish American Congress Medal of Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cas Lenard's life was a triumph. His legacy is a deep friendship and alliance between the United States and a free, democratic Poland. His children and grandchildren are in my thoughts and prayers.</paragraph>
