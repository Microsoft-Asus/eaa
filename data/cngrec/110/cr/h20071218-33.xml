(A) section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) (commonly known as the "Price-Anderson Act")--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) provides a predictable legal framework necessary for nuclear projects; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) ensures prompt and equitable compensation in the event of a nuclear incident in the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) the Price-Anderson Act, in effect, provides operators of nuclear powerplants with insurance for damage arising out of a nuclear incident and funds the insurance primarily through the assessment of a retrospective premium from each operator after the occurrence of a nuclear incident;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, done at Vienna on September 12, 1997, will establish a global system--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) to provide a predictable legal framework necessary for nuclear energy projects; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) to ensure prompt and equitable compensation in the event of a nuclear incident;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) the Convention benefits United States nuclear suppliers that face potentially unlimited liability for nuclear incidents that are not covered by the Price-Anderson Act by replacing a potentially open-ended liability with a predictable liability regime that, in effect, provides nuclear suppliers with insurance for damage arising out of such an incident;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) the Convention also benefits United States nuclear facility operators that may be publicly liable for a Price-Anderson incident by providing an additional early source of funds to compensate damage arising out of the Price-Anderson incident;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (F) the combined operation of the Convention, the Price-Anderson Act, and this section will augment the quantity of assured funds available for victims in a wider variety of nuclear incidents while reducing the potential liability of United States suppliers without increasing potential costs to United States operators;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (G) the cost of those benefits is the obligation of the United States to contribute to the supplementary compensation fund established by the Convention; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (H) any such contribution should be funded in a manner that does not--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) upset settled expectations based on the liability regime established under the Price-Anderson Act; or&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) shift to Federal taxpayers liability risks for nuclear incidents at foreign installations;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (I) with respect to a Price-Anderson incident, funds already available under the Price-Anderson Act should be used; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (J) with respect to a nuclear incident outside the United States not covered by the Price-Anderson Act, a retrospective premium should be prorated among nuclear suppliers relieved from potential liability for which insurance is not available.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) PURPOSE.--The purpose of this section is to allocate the contingent costs associated with participation by the United States in the international nuclear liability compensation system established by the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, done at Vienna on September 12, 1997--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) with respect to a Price-Anderson incident, by using funds made available under section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) to cover the contingent costs in a manner that neither increases the burdens nor decreases the benefits under section 170 of that Act; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) with respect to a covered incident outside the United States that is not a Price-Anderson incident, by allocating the contingent costs equitably, on the basis of risk, among the class of nuclear suppliers relieved by the Convention from the risk of potential liability resulting from any covered incident outside the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 1 minute to my friend, the distinguished majority leader of the House, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a historic day for the House of Representatives; it's a historic day for the  Dean of the House; it's a historic day for the leadership of this House; and it will be, I think, viewed as a very important day for America and our energy independence and for our effort to keep our environment sustainable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank and congratulate the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. I said this when we last considered the bill on this floor; no Member of this body has focused more on energy and energy policy, energy independence, throughout the years than has the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Save for his singular focus on ensuring the health of all Americans and their availability of affordable health care, quality health care, his focus on energy and energy independence and efficient use of energy has been unmatched, and I congratulate him for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As he said when this bill passed out of the House, it wasn't the perfect bill. There are many of us in this House who would have hoped that the Senate would not have removed some of the items that were in this bill when it came from the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having said that, Mr. Speaker, this landmark bipartisan legislation, the Energy Independence and Security Act, represents a vital turning point for our Nation and a historic accomplishment for this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we set a new direction for this country in the area of energy policy. Our Nation's energy policy is inextricably linked to our national security, our economic security, and our environmental well-being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, I have long believed that we must summon our national will, resources and ingenuity to make significant gains in technology, conservation, vehicle efficiency, and the use of alternative fuels in order to end our reliance on foreign oil and other important sources of energy. To that extent, this bill was and remains a vital national security interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this legislation, we will move toward real energy independence that results in a stronger economy, more jobs, and healthier communities. The Chairs and ranking members that worked tirelessly to produce this bill are also to be congratulated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the leadership of Chairman Dingell, as I have said, this bill includes historic fuel economy, renewable fuels, and energy efficiency provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The increase in the fuel efficiency of vehicles to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 is the first in a generation, and is supported by environmentalists and the automobile industry, in no small part because of the work of Chairman Dingell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, it will result in $22 billion in net annual consumer savings by 2020 and reduce greenhouse gases in an amount equal to taking off the road 28 million of today's average cars and trucks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among other things, this bill will reduce our reliance on foreign oil by investing in the production and infrastructure needed to deploy homegrown biofuels. It provides incentives for plug-in hybrid cars. And it includes landmark energy efficiency provisions that will save consumers and businesses at least $300 billion through 2030.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let no one be mistaken, this bill, while comprehensive, does not represent the totality of our energy policy. There is still much more to do, and we will be about that business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, we should take up legislation to establish a renewable portfolio standard and extend the production tax credit, and do so promptly. We also should continue to work across the aisle and with the Senate to reach further consensus on issues such as the use of renewables, the development of new technologies, and the fiscally responsible extension of needed energy tax provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when we started this session, we started it on a historic note and swore in the first woman Speaker in the history of America, in the history of this House of over 200 years. As she was sworn in, we had literally scores of children who surrounded the Speaker. And she intoned that this would be the "children's Congress," it would be the "children's Congress," and it would look to the future, not the past. And this bill looks to the future of energy use, of energy efficiency, of  energy security, and of the health of this tiny globe on which all of us survive and hopefully thrive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a historic turning point in America's energy policy. And I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, for our children, for our future, for our security, vote for this historic piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, it's interesting how different people can see the same set of circumstances and come to totally different conclusions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last Congress, we passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 on a bipartisan basis. There were open markups in the House and the Senate. There was an open conference committee that was televised in some cases. We had, I believe, a majority of the Democrats vote for that bill on the House floor, a majority of the Democrats in the Senate, and obviously almost all the Republicans in both bodies. It was the most comprehensive energy bill to be signed into law in probably the last 30 or 40 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the things in that bill are going to be undone if and when this bill passes and the President signs it, which he is expected to do so. I understand the consequences of elections. I understand there is a new majority. I do not understand how what made sense 2 years ago doesn't make sense today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's take the issue of fuel economy standards. If there is a crown jewel in this bill, it apparently is that we're going to raise CAFE standards significantly for the first time in 30 years. On the surface, that may appear to be a good thing, but let me point out a few things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are over 350 models of automobiles and trucks that are currently available for sale to the American public. There are only eight vehicles that get 35 miles to the gallon. They are the Honda Fit, the Honda Civic, the Honda Civic Hybrid, the Toyota Yaris, both manual and automatic, Toyota Corolla, Toyota Camry Hybrid, and the Toyota Prius. That's it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, let's look at the top eight selling vehicles that the American public have bought so far this year. Number one is the Ford F-series pickup. Number two is the Chevrolet Silverado pickup. Number three is the Toyota Camry, not the Camry Hybrid. Number four is the Dodge Ram pickup. Number five is the Honda Accord. Number six is the Toyota Corolla. Number seven is the Honda Civic. Number eight is the Nissan Altima. Only two or three of those get 35 miles to the gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will stipulate, as smart as our engineers in Detroit are, it is going to be very, very difficult, if not impossible, for the Ford F-series pickups, the Chevy Silverado and the Dodge Ram pickup to get 35 miles to the gallon by the year 2020.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are vehicles that meet the standard. Some of those make the top list of sales, but three of the top four do not. I will stipulate by setting the standard at 35 miles to the gallon, will we improve fuel economy? Yes, we will. Will we reach the holy grail of 35 miles per gallon on a fleet average by 2020? If I had to guess, I would bet we'll be back on this floor within the next 10 years providing for an extension of that because I think it's going to be technologically very difficult, if  not impossible. And I think economically it's not going to be possible at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the bill before us is is a mandatory conservation bill. Now, conservation in and of itself is a good thing. I won't deny that. But conservation without some supply is a bad thing, and that's what this bill is. We're preempting State and local building codes with Federal building standards for so-called "green buildings." We're mandating 35 billion gallons of alternative fuels that right now the technology simply doesn't exist. Hopefully our engineers and scientists can make that happen,  but what if they don't?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are also basically just changing the way that we operate in a market economy for energy in this country to the government knows the best and the government is going to tell the American people what's best for them, whether the American people like it or not. I think that's a mistake, Mr.  Speaker. And for that reason, I would hope we vote against the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us today takes measurable and concrete steps to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Most importantly, it is a piece of legislation that will be signed into law by the President. And as such, it represents a glimmer of hope that we will be able to get beyond the gridlock that has afflicted us for far too long in far too many areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the birth pains of this legislation, and there have been many, it is a good bill. Is it a perfect bill? No. But it is good enough to be supported by the Members. More has to be done, and we will do it. This is, then, a good bill. Its core is a series of requirements that will improve energy efficiency of almost every product and tool and appliance that is used in the United States from light bulbs to light trucks. We are requiring a 40 percent increase in the fuel economy of our motor  vehicles, and we are doing it in a way that gives manufacturers the flexibility they need to get the job done while preserving American jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress is establishing specific numbers and targets, including new categories of vehicles, in a comprehensive approach to fuel efficiency. Along with the efficiency standards for homes, appliances and lighting, we will be removing from the atmosphere 10 billion tons or more of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by 2030. That is the equivalent of taking all cars, trucks and planes off the road and out of the skies for 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is not the final word on energy security or climate change. We will be needing to do more, and we will. To be specific, I believe that it is possible for us to craft renewable energy requirements for electrical utilities, something which was dropped in the final stages of the bill because of the imperfections of the Senate's work, and a low carbon fuel standard. These are matters we will be addressing next year as we craft comprehensive climate change legislation on which the  Committee on Energy and Commerce is now working. But that takes nothing away from today's achievement, which represents solid accomplishment and an essential downpayment towards reducing our dependence on foreign sources of oil and reducing greenhouse emissions.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400165" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today, of course, in opposition to the Senate amendment to <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>. And as I've said before on many occasions, I think our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have really missed an opportunity to pass energy legislation that would actually do something to produce and enhance supplies of domestic sources of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today does absolutely nothing. It doesn't produce a barrel of oil. And I'm from an energy State. Ten of our States are energy States. I don't see how anybody from energy States can vote for a bill that calls itself an energy bill that doesn't produce any energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's really a sad day. But it's not sad for people my age and the people of the average age of this body here. It's sad for those juniors and seniors in high school and those in early college, those that might be called on to go overseas and take energy away from someone when we have plenty right here at home which we could be mining.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's sad that we're not hitting ANWR. It's sad that we're depending on Saudi Arabia for 40 percent of our energy and 20 percent from other Arab nations when they don't like us and we don't like them and we don't trust them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a bill that will put our children on troop ships to go somewhere to take oil or gas or energy away from countries when we don't have to. We have plenty right here in this country. But we're turning our backs on the young people of this Nation, and we ought to be ashamed for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a lousy bill. It's a bad energy bill. It should be defeated. It won't be defeated. But I certainly ask everybody to vote against it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Michigan for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate amendment now pending before the House, and I urge its approval by the House. We are poised today to make a landmark advance in national energy policy. By 2020, vehicle fuel economy will increase by 40 percent, reaching 35 miles per gallon when averaging together cars and light trucks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend Chairman Dingell of our Energy and Commerce Committee and the outstanding committee staff who have worked so long and hard in order to bring this advance before the House today in the form of legislation that has a bipartisan base of support and that, in fact, will be signed by the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under our energy efficiency provisions, future greenhouse gas emissions will be lessened by 10 billion tons over the next two decades. In the year 2030 alone, our efficiency provisions will reduce CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 emissions by an amount equal to the annual emissions of all of the cars and trucks on America's highways today and the grounding of all airplanes now flying in the United States for a total of 5 years. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>We make more than 40 separate energy efficiency improvements. They set new standards for lighting many multiples beyond today's requirements. They set higher standards for future models of an array of consumer products from refrigerators to freezers to dishwashers to clothes washers to residential boilers, electric motors and electric fans. They create a process to capture much of the heat that is wasted today in America's industrial operations, enabling us to generate potentially as much as  60 gigawatts of electricity from that wasted industrial heat; and that could be done without emitting any carbon dioxide beyond what is emitted today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that we bring to the House creates a Federal support policy in support of a smart grid and electricity demand response leading to the day when homeowners can save money by consuming more electricity at times of lower demand when prices are less and then not consuming electricity during the high peak hours when electricity is considerably more costly. We promote plug-in hybrids and advanced auto batteries to bring closer the day when most transportation in the United States will be electrically  powered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill requires a major increase in the use of biofuels, enhancing our energy security and further reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure is a landmark energy achievement, and I strongly encourage its adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the Speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi, who from the day that she took office as our Speaker has strongly encouraged this energy advance. I don't think it would have happened without her strong leadership. And I again want to thank the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee for all of the work he has done and the landmark achievements that this bill represents.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I spent 25 years in the retail car business, so I know a little bit about cars and fuel economy. I support this bill because it is an effective compromise that will move us towards less dependence on foreign oil while still allowing manufacturers to build cars and trucks that people will want to buy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill clearly represents Congress's intent for fuel economy standards to be regulated through NHTSA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Other agencies, like the EPA, may also stake a claim for fuel economy standards. If they do,  it would clearly make no sense for them to establish a different standard than the one being authorized by Congress today. The President said so in an executive order in May, and Congress is saying so today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Anything any other agency may do must be consistent and harmonized with this act. There can and should be only one national fuel economy standard, and this is it. With this standard, consumers can look forward in the future to cars and trucks with the room and performance that they want, but with the fuel economy and alternative fuels that we need.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for yielding me this time, and I want to join with my colleagues in thanking him so much for all of his leadership on this legislation, his knowledge of the subject matter, and his ability to work out the intricacies in what may be the longest-standing battle in the Congress, and that is on fuel economies. But he has put together a standard that will work for the consumers, it will for the environment, it will work for the auto industry, and  it will work for the people who work in that industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, Mr. Dingell, I want to thank you for that. I also want to join in thanking the Speaker of the House of Representatives for making this her most important priority for this legislation, to give us an opportunity, this Congress and the American public, to break with the past, to break with the stranglehold of the old way of thinking both about our transportation sector and about our energy sector, to introduce into that sector the competition of alternative energy sources, of renewable  energy sources, of efficient automobiles that will change America dramatically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas, we know, with this legislation, many have said it, by 2030 it will save almost 4 million barrels a day. That is almost the equivalent of the output of this entire Nation. You can keep thinking that you can produce your way out of this problem, but it has shown that we can't. We continue to become more and more reliant on questionable sources of energy, and yet this legislation itself will produce, just the automobile standards will produce half of what we import from the Persian Gulf.  This changes that dramatically. You can find oil in conservation. You can find oil in Detroit. Or you can find it in the Persian Gulf. We chose to go in the smart direction, to think about conservation, not only its impact on energy, but on the environment and on the pocketbook of the American public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four million barrels of oil a day saved by 2030, five times the output of the Alaska pipeline today, five times. It is like finding money in the street and oil in the street. It doesn't mean we won't continue to produce, but it means we are going to be very smart about oil production in this country and about the use of energy on behalf of this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also wanted to mention that we address the jobs that are going to be created by this commitment to renewables, this commitment to alternative energy sources, whether it is in nuclear, whether it is in coal, whether it is in the automobile industry or in the renewables sources, and that was the green jobs bill to provide training and expertise for people in solar panel manufacturing, construction work, and renewable energy and initiatives. Those are very important. Those were reported out of  the Committee on Education and Labor and were championed by Congresswoman HILDA SOLIS and by Congressman JOHN TIERNEY on that legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation has a potential to create millions of new jobs in new industries of the future in every geographical sector of America, not just confined to the old centers of manufacturing, but all across this country for new high-skilled jobs for the future.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400317" topic="">
    <paragraph>I'm not opposed to CAFE. I'm not opposed to fuel efficiency. I'm not opposed to biofuels. But, folks, you are overselling them. We have an energy crisis today, not 5 years from now. OPEC told us last week no more oil, get used to $90 to $100 oil. Today it is $92. Today we have the highest home heating costs ever, the highest diesel costs ever, the highest gasoline costs ever. The poor and middle class of this country are struggling to heat their homes and afford  to drive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill, foreign dependence will not decrease. It is currently at 66 percent, and for the last 10 years, for the last 10 years, 2 percent a year, dependence, 2 percent a year, folks, it is going to continue for the next 5 because this doesn't produce energy for 5. If this continues, 76 percent of our energy will be foreign dependent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentlemen from Massachusetts and California stated we will save 4 million barrels a day with CAFE and biofuels today combined. Not now. Not in 5 years, but by 2030. That is 23 years. Our increase in energy need from population growth alone will be greater than that. We grew 5 billion barrel a day in the last 25 years in need for oil. This will have no impact for 5 years. Can Americans afford no relief for 5 years? $90 to $100 oil can sink the economy of this country. Every recession has been  energy related. This country is on the verge of going into a recession because of energy prices. As we conserve and become more efficient, we must have more energy also, produce the Outer Continental Shelf, Alaska, and the Midwest and lessen our foreign dependence, increase nuclear production of electricity, implement clean coal technology, stimulate the production of fuel and gas from coal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our growing need for affordable energy is growing faster than the savings in this bill. America expects more of us. They don't want to wait 5 years: high home heating costs, high driving costs, the chance of their job going abroad. We are going to lose a million or two jobs in this country because we have the highest energy prices in the world. Our natural gas prices are higher than everybody, and clean, green natural gas, which you oppose producing, is the best fuel for America's future to get  us by this difficult stage we are in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen, we need policy that will bring energy to Americans so they can afford to live their lives, so they can maintain the manufacturing and processing jobs, so we can afford to move our goods across this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are in an energy crisis, folks. This bill does not resolve a crisis. It has futuristic things in it. But we are not going to resolve the energy crisis in America. People in America expect more of us, and we should be delivering more.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Vel&#xE1;zquez).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. VEL&#xC1;ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, today is a historic day for America. This legislation blazes a trail by putting small businesses at the forefront of solving our energy problems. It is clear there is no greater obstacle to our long-term economic growth than the rising costs of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this bill, we are not only addressing this challenge today, but also for future generations, and leading the effort will be this Nation's entrepreneurs. This legislation will enable small farmers to produce more clean energy. Small businesses already make up 85 percent of the renewable fuels industry, and this ensures they remain  viable in a global economy. The establishment of the Renewable Fuels Capital Investment Company will only increase the  number of small firms involved in producing ethanol and biodiesel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Small manufacturers are also expected to expand their efforts in improving energy conservation. With greater access to capital for developing clean technologies, these firms can use these resources to innovate and create designs to enhance efficiency. When people talk about a green economy and green collar jobs, they talk about small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, these reforms sustain and expand the efforts of small businesses in adding stability to our energy markets. This will be accomplished by reducing energy usage, encouraging conservation and limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The bill before us shows that meeting the needs of our environment doesn't mean we cannot meet the needs of our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, Mr. Speaker, I commend the leadership on this important bill, support its immediate passage, and urge the President to sign this into law.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank our ranking member from Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find it so interesting, Mr. Speaker, that so many of our colleagues refer to this as a historic day. I think, in some regards, it certainly is. Certainly the New York Times regards it as a historic day, and I quote from the New York Times this morning where they say, and I am quoting, "This is one of the most ambitious dictates ever issued to American business."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Mr. Speaker, I think that that happens, because in this 805 pages, the 16 titles of this bill, we don't do anything to produce energy, and this is not a bill that is focused on energy independence. But what it does do is pick winners and losers, Mr. Speaker, and that is something that the American people and American business are going to realize very, very quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I also find it interesting, and I think it is historic from another point of view. What has happened to the price of gas at the pump since the majority took control in January? Since that time, it has gone up by over 33 percent, and we know that our families are feeling it more. In January, an average mom in Tennessee's Seventh Congressional District that I have the honor to represent paid about $34 to fill up her 15-gallon tank. Today, she is paying $45. Moving us toward energy independence  should be a goal for this Congress, and it is unfortunate, and maybe it could be termed historic, that this is a piece of legislation in 805 pages that is not going to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are seeing those prices increase. That mom is going to spend an extra $528 this year in order to fill up that pump. So what we should be doing is focusing on how we best move this Nation to energy independence, how we best achieve that goal, and how we best represent our constituents.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Minnesota, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, my good friend, Mr. Peterson.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400316" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, I want to rise to commend Chairman Dingell for the outstanding work that he did on this legislation. He, once again, produced a good bill that can be signed, as he always does. I also want to commend the Speaker, the rest of our leadership; the Speaker, especially, for her focus, or we wouldn't probably be here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Ag Committee, the most important part of this bill is the renewable fuel standard. I want to thank the chairman for putting a 9-billion-gallon standard in for next year on ethanol. We have gotten to the point of 7 billion gallons of production right now. The RFS is 5 billion. In order to keep this industry going, we need this 9-billion RFS next year. So this is going to get us back on track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a 36-billion-gallon number in the overall bill. What this RFS does with the 9 billion for ethanol, and 500 million, up to a billion for biodiesel, it will set the stage for the next generation of ethanol, which is going to be cellulosic, and for new feedstocks for biodiesel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when you take this bill and put it together with what we have put in the farm bill, this is going to set the stage for us to be able to produce at least 30 percent of our fuel from agriculture down the road. We are not going to be the total solution to this problem, though we are going to be a big part of the solution, and we are excited about being involved in this process and making this happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is a historic day. This is going to be a tremendous boost for us in agriculture. We just want to thank the chairman and all the members that worked on this. It's a good piece of legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from the great State of Alaska, former chairman of the Transportation Committee and the Natural Resources Committee, Mr. Young.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400440" topic="">
    <paragraph>My friends, it's not very hard to understand why our country is facing an energy crisis; in fact, it's very simple. America needs more oil, gas, coal, nuclear and hydropower. We need more wind power. But Congress has refused to unlock these resources. This bill does nothing to release those resources allowed to provide us with the energy. It concentrates on corn, switchgrass, and a few hybrid cars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friends, oil, gas, coal, nuclear and hydropower are the backbone of this country. They supply more than 90 percent of our energy needs to fuel the world's number one economy. I would add that developing them does not raise the price of food, such as corn. There's no shortage of these energy resources in America. There is a shortage of the will to develop them. In fact, the majority leadership of this body, the last two Democrat Presidents and their allies in the environmental movement have  created a false energy shortage through their constant attempts to lock up homegrown energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me give you a few examples. They want to ban all offshore oil and gas development. They oppose U.S. oil production of North America's largest onshore prospect. They stopped oil and shale development in the omnibus spending bill. They opposed coal, and even applauded when President Clinton locked up millions of tons of clean fuel in Utah. They want the tens of trillions of cubic feet of clean-burning natural gas in the Rocky Mountains locked up forever. They oppose nuclear power plants; they,  being the majority party. They oppose hydroelectric power. They even want to tear down nonpolluting hydroelectric dams in the Northwest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They want to impose high taxes on the use of energy, driving energy prices paid by your constituents to even higher than they are today. They even oppose using biomass of overgrown, unhealthy forests as a renewable fuel supply. In particular, the biofuel mandate in this bill is a direction to burn down forests and close more mills in the West.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than half of Alaska's Federal land, and we have enormous potential for a biofuels industry; this bill stops all of that. This bill will hold Alaska to the highest standards. Alaskans would be forced to purchase the most efficient, read the most expensive, appliances. The residents of the wealthy district in San Francisco have money to buy the most efficient, expensive furnaces and air conditioners, and I would bet most of them are inclined to spend their money on them. Many Alaskans, however,  cannot afford to spend the extra $200, $300, $400 for the most efficient furnaces. Under this bill, they will have to. In a survey of 100 Alaskan communities, the average price of gas is $5 a gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority leader is playing Russian roulette with the economy. This year, every bill we've passed concerning energy is another bullet in the chamber of a gun staring point-blank at America's head, and by my count, it's already fully loaded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a bad bill. It's a charade. It's a disgrace for this body to vote "yes" for this bill. I am urging us to vote "no."</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400425" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. It's a good bill as far as it goes. It's not the best bill. I know we always hear statements extolling legislation as if it were the best thing since sliced bread. The bill has some very positive features. It will give Americans more fuel-efficient automobiles. That could save families $700 to $1,000 a year, money that won't be going to the Middle East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation will give Americans more efficient appliances and consumer goods, saving us hundreds of billions of dollars on electricity bills over the next few decades. In the House Oversight Committee, we reported out a provision in this bill that will dramatically improve the efficiency of new and renovated Federal buildings and reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this bill did not keep the provision adopted in the House for renewable energy, renewable energy that would have moved us away from burning fossil fuels like natural gas and coal for our electricity. That was taken out of the House bill, and then the Senate put in a provision that would have enormous loan guarantees for nuclear power and the coal industry. So when you look at the balance of what we are doing for renewables, it is minuscule compared to what we are putting in for loan guarantees  for nuclear and coal. Now, that is not in this bill, but it is in the omnibus bill, and I am very disappointed in that provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am disappointed that we didn't go further in a lot of other areas, but we are going to have to fight for those in the next year. At this point, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I guess it is the best we could do, and it has got some good features in it. On that basis, I will vote for the legislation and urge my colleagues to vote for it as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, legislation is like making sausage. When Henry Waxman and John Shimkus come to the floor on an energy bill that we grudgingly will support, that is probably newsworthy in itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A couple of things. First, congratulations to Mattoon, Illinois, that has been named as the FutureGen site for the next generation of coal-fired clean emissions plants. I want to put that on the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The benefit of this bill is the tax increase is out of this bill. That is a plus. That is less cost to the American consumer. The RFS is out of this bill. That is a plus for the consumer. The RFS was unable to be met and would have been costly to the consumer. The RFS could have been better. It could have been an alternative fuel standard which brought in coal-to-liquid technologies that I have talked numerous times on the floor about, taking coal, using fossil fuels, turning it into clean-burning  liquid fuels. That is a fight we will have to bring to the floor another time. And the CAFE language is an acceptable compromise that industry supports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The world will continue to demand more energy, not less. We have to focus on more supply. That supply comes from coal. It comes from natural gas. It will come from nuclear power. While this bill doesn't measure up to the demands that we need in the future, it is an acceptable start.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I will support the bill, but continue to come to the floor talking about the importance of bringing coal, nuclear and natural gas portfolios to the energy debate; coal-to-liquid technologies, which takes a natural resource; a U.S. refinery to fuel our war machines of the future, whether that is aviation fuel, whether that is diesel fuel; clean-burning technologies that are available today. The majority is going to have to wise up and know there has to be more supply in the energy debate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland, a member of the committee, my friend Mr. Wynn.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400438" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying that I rise in strong support of this measure. I want to thank our chairman, Mr. Dingell, for his excellent work in what was obviously a long and contentious process. I want to particularly note the work of the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Boucher, the gentleman from Virginia. He did an excellent job moving us through this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does several very good things. The underlying philosophy, though, is simply this: We all want energy independence. We all want to reduce global warming. But the fundamental thing we have to do here in America is change the way we live. We have to conserve and we have to save, and this bill puts us on the right road to accomplish those two goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the bill addresses the question of fuel efficiency with a compromise that most people can live with, and that is significant because we drive a lot of cars in this country, and it is important that we get the best fuel economy that we can get.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also do some very simple things, such as address the question of energy-efficient light bulbs. Everybody uses light bulbs, and we can do better. This bill moves us in that direction and encourages the development of more energy-efficient lighting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, in the course of the hearings conducted by the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Boucher, we heard the National Conference of Mayors say that we need a partnership. If we are serious about energy efficiency and all these lofty goals, it is not just a Federal problem. It is a Federal, State and local problem, and they urged us to include a block grant program to help States and cities and counties participate in the issue of energy efficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That language is in this bill. It is called the Energy Efficiency Block Grant Program. It is authorized to the tune of $10 billion. It will allow cities to develop comprehensive programs; towns and counties to develop programs to create energy efficiency, such as programs for homeowners, weatherization programs for seniors, a planning guide for green buildings and more efficiency in planning, traffic flow improvements. All these things could be done through this block grant program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is good. It leads us in the right direction. I urge its adoption.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, once again we are here to vote on the majority's newest No Energy Act, and I stand in opposition to that when America is facing the highest energy costs ever. We are here today with a bill that mandates plenty, but has no new energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are told that today is a turning point, and it absolutely is a turning point. Last night in that first turning point we took 2 trillion barrels of American oil off the market. Instead of closing off American jobs, we should be working to encourage American energy companies to expand their operations building U.S. jobs and cutting back on the money we send to the Middle East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a turning point today if you need the muscle of an SUV or strong pickup. You just aren't going to have that if you are a rancher or maybe in the oil and gas industry or something in the mining industry. It is a turning point for biomass, because we in the West have many Federal lands, but we are restricted from taking off biomass from those Federal lands by this bill today. It is a turning point for conservation, because if you own a 20-room house, 10,000-room mansion like Al Gore does,  you might be able to afford the new conservation techniques that are implied and required in this bill. If you are making $25,000 a year, in New Mexico, you probably can't afford that replacement furnace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our economy needs an expanded domestic energy supply. We need more clean domestic natural gas; we need to open our lands to renewable energy development, we need to utilize our domestic oil reserves; and we need to develop nuclear energy. And this bill is silent about nuclear energy. We need to make energy more affordable by making the supply greater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our largest competitor, China, has made that choice. They are building one new coal plant each week for the next 10 years. We are trying to stop those plants here. It is the most affordable of energy. China has doubled their domestic natural gas supply since 2000. How different would our economy be? This is a bad bill. We should turn this bill down and do what is right for the country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank all those who worked so hard to produce this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, the class of 2006 listened as Americans spoke out demanding that we change direction in our energy policy. Americans, regardless of their political affiliation, understood that America was in an energy crisis, that we were too dependent on foreign oil, that we were unable to carry the message of conservation across this land, and that we had very poor gas mileage at a time when the technology has been in existence for many years. So Americans asked Congress to make this change, and  we were sent to Washington to do that. And I am standing here today so proud to say that this is the day that we are going to answer Americans' concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have now passed a bill, or will be passing a bill, that is not one that has everything that we wanted in it, obviously, but we have the direction and we have the energy and we have the resources and we have the plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are increasing the gas mileage. For the first time in over 30 years we are finally increasing our gas mileage. We are reducing our oil dependence on foreign nations. We have been forced to talk to foreign nations for our oil. That is the wrong approach in this country and an unnecessary approach. We are increasing biofuels, which will be our future, and we are growing jobs. This is critical for our economy right now. We are expecting that there will be 3 million new jobs across America because  of our green incentive here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are increasing our energy efficiency, and we are also convincing the younger generation that conservation is our future, and that our generation is listening to their generation and protecting future Americans. I urge my colleagues to recognize what we have done here and to support every effort of the legislation, and I thank those who brought this to the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400414" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Waxman lamented on the floor a few minutes ago than this was the best that we could do. I am sorry that I don't agree with that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the year 2030, our energy needs are going to grow by more than 50 percent, and none of us, none of us here, none of us in the country are happy with the energy prices or our reliance on foreign oil, and all of us realize that we have to do a lot more. Just because this is the last day or two of the session, to bring up a bill to just say that we tackled the energy issue, I don't think is good enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This process was pretty much closed. There were few amendments that were allowed in the process. We had no conference. I can remember serving on the 2005 energy bill conference with Mr. Dingell and Mr. Barton, my chairman then, and together we collectively passed bipartisan legislation that we were indeed proud of. But this legislation is not as good as we can do. It is not comprehensive. It doesn't deal with coal, which provides nearly 50 percent of this Nation's energy. It  doesn't deal with nuclear power, which today provides 20 percent of our Nation's needs. We know that we are going to need to build probably about another two dozen nuclear facilities by the year 2030 to maintain 20 percent. It does nothing on nuclear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>RPS, the renewable portfolio standard, I think many of us can support that. Maybe not the amendment that passed here in the House that the Senate rejected, but there is room for a compromise here. We can do things on wind and solar. We didn't even have the opportunity on this floor or in committee to really come up with a respectable RPS amendment. Coal-to-liquid, there is a bipartisan bill out there that is led by Mr. Boucher and Mr. Shimkus, I am a cosponsor, that deals with  carbon sequestration. Again, it is not part of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mileage standards. No, it is not a perfect provision. We can all support increasing mileage standards. But, again, we missed the opportunity to work together to get a bill that in fact could move this country forward. Biofuels, we have a biofuel mandate here, but we don't have the technology. How are we going to complete the action on this? How wise is that? Mr. Speaker, this bill is, frankly, incomplete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I am the new ranking member on the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, and I would like to think that in the days ahead, the weeks and months ahead, after this bill in the early new year, that Mr. Boucher, my chairman in my subcommittee, Mr. Dingell, the chairman of the full committee, and Mr. Barton, my great friend and former chairman and now ranking member, can in fact sit down together so that we can work on a comprehensive bill that deals with all of these  different issues that we can then bring back on the House floor and bring back a bill that every one of us here can be proud of that will take a giant leap in the right direction, rather than taking a baby step here or there and somehow saying we have passed it, we have got a Band-Aid, it is now done.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished chairman. I, because of my representation of the energy capital of the world, Houston, Texas, support this particular legislation, for it makes a new statement about energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, I think it is imperative that we all agree on the vital importance of America achieving energy independence in the 21st century. We must end our addiction to foreign sources of oil, most of which are found in regions of the world which are unstable and in some cases, opposed to our interests. Accordingly, there is no issue more integral to our economic and national security than energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Energy Independence and Security Act is important and multifaceted legislation which will make substantial strides toward energy independence for our Nation, while also encouraging the development of innovative new technologies, creating new jobs, reducing carbon emissions, protecting consumers, shifting production to clean and renewable energy, and modernizing our energy infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to begin by commending the Speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi, for her leadership in introducing this legislation and bringing it to the floor. The bill we have before us today builds upon the New Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act, of which I was a supporter, which passed last summer. This new piece of legislation represents Democrats' commitment to bring a comprehensive new direction to the people of the United States, a new direction which  must ensure America's energy independence as well as an America conscious of and working to combat global climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to being from the energy capital of the world, for the past 12 years I have been the chair of the Energy Braintrust of the Congressional Black Caucus. During this time, I have hosted a variety of energy Braintrusts designed to bring in all of the relevant players ranging from environmentalists to producers of energy from a variety of sectors including coal, electric, natural gas, nuclear, oil, and alternative energy sources as well as energy producers from West Africa. My Energy Braintrusts  were designed to be a call of action to all of the sectors who comprise the American and international energy industry, to the African American community, and to the Nation as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Energy is the lifeblood of every economy, especially ours. Producing more of it leads to more good jobs, cheaper goods, lower fuel prices, and greater economic and national security. Bringing together thoughtful yet disparate voices to engage each other on the issue of energy independence has resulted in the beginning of a transformative dialectic which can ultimately result in reforming our energy industry to the extent that we as a nation achieve energy security and energy independence.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H16745]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because I represent the city of Houston, the energy capital of the world, I realize that many oil and gas companies provide many jobs for many of my constituents and serve a valuable need. The energy industry in Houston exemplifies the stakeholders who must be instrumental in devising a pragmatic strategy for resolving our national energy crisis. That is why it is crucial that while seeking solutions to secure more energy independence within this country, we must strike a balance that will still  support an environment for continued growth in the oil and gas industry, which I might add, creates millions of jobs across the entire country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have many more miles to go before we achieve energy independence. Consequently, I am willing, able, and eager to continue working with Houston's and our Nation's energy industry to ensure that we are moving expeditiously on the path to crafting an environmentally sound and economically viable energy policy. Furthermore, I think it is imperative that we involve small, minority and women owned, and independent energy companies in this process because they represent some of the hard working Americans  and Houstonians who are on the forefront of energy efficient strategies to achieving energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This unprecedented piece of legislation contains numerous important provisions. Specifically, it contains provisions that will require that new cars and trucks increase their fuel economy standards to 35 miles per gallon by the year 2020. This provision alone is estimated to save American families $700 to $1,000 a year at the gas pump. Congress has not increased the fuel economy standards since 1975, illuminating the historical new direction this Congress is taking to ensure America's energy  security and independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, this important legislation encourages and promotes the use of renewable forms of energy produced right here in the United States. Not only does it require that 15 percent of our electricity come from renewable sources, but it also provides incentives in the form of tax credits for those American's who are conscious of their energy production and consumption. With America's leading energy producers as an integral part of the solution to our current foreign energy dependence, we will  be able to move forward to a new period in which America will be secure in its domestic energy supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the U.S. Minerals Management Service, MMS, America's deep seas on the Outer Continental Shelf, OCS, contain 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, the U.S. consumes 23 TCF per year, and 86 billion barrels of oil, the U.S. imports 4.5 billion per year. Even with all these energy resources, the U.S. sends more than $300 billion, and countless American jobs, overseas every year for energy we can create at home. I believe that we should mandate environmentally safe and efficient exploration  techniques in the gulf coast which energy companies have demonstrated a willingness and capacity to utilize. By ensuring access to increasing sources of energy in an environmentally conscious way, I believe we can decrease our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also contains a crucial international component. Global climate change is a truly global problem. It is real; it is imminent; and it is our responsibility to work with the rest of the international community to develop a coordinated global response to this potentially devastating phenomenon. Because this legislation contains an unprecedented fuel efficiency standard as well as a renewable electricity standard in conjunction with a myriad of energy efficiency provisions, it will significantly  reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of the United States that lead to climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, I support innovative solutions to our national energy crisis, such as my legislation which alleviates our dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels by utilizing loan guarantees to promote the development of traditional and cellulosic ethanol technology. This legislation significantly strengthens and extends existing renewable energy tax credits, including solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydro, landfill gas, and trash combustion. Furthermore, it will bolster research on geothermal,  solar, and marine renewable energy, providing us with the information we need to move forward in the trajectory of clean, renewable, and domestically produced energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Energy Information Administration estimates that the United States imports nearly 60 percent of the oil it consumes. The world's greatest petroleum reserves reside in regions of high geopolitical risk, including 57 percent of which are in the Persian Gulf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Replacing oil imports with domestic alternatives such as traditional and cellulosic ethanol can not only help reduce the $180 billion that oil contributes to our annual trade deficit, it can end our addiction to foreign oil. According to the Department of Agriculture, biomass can displace 30 percent of our Nation's petroleum consumption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along with traditional production of ethanol from corn, cellulosic ethanol can be produced domestically from a variety of feedstocks, including switchgrass, corn stalks, and municipal solid wastes, which are available throughout our Nation. Cellulosic ethanol also relies on its own byproducts to fuel the refining process, yielding a positive energy balance. Whereas the potential production of traditional corn-based ethanol is about 10 billion gallons per year, the potential production of cellulosic  ethanol is estimated to be 60 billion gallons per year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to ensuring access to more abundant sources of energy, replacing petroleum use with ethanol will help reduce US carbon emissions, which are otherwise expected to increase by 80 percent by 2025. Cellulosic ethanol can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 87 percent. Thus, transitioning from foreign oil to ethanol will protect our environment from dangerous carbon and greenhouse gas emissions. With its commitment to American biofuels, this legislation calls for a significant increase  in the Renewable Fuels Standard. It encourages the diversification of American energy crops thus ensuring that biodiesel and cellulosic sources are key components in America's drive to become energy independent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation goes further than any previous attempt at securing America's energy security by providing incentives and rewards for the population for their use and production of renewable energy. It will also help the American family in its production of over 3 million green jobs over the next 10 years as well as increasing the loan limits that will help small businesses develop energy efficient technologies and purchases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this comprehensive legislation addresses the full range of concerns raised by global climate change. It offers wide-ranging solutions to the serious problems we, as a nation and as an international community, face. It demonstrates the ongoing commitment of this Democratic Congress to address these important issues, and to provide tangible and beneficial solutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that through our efforts at compromise, this legislation reflects an improvement from <bill type="h" number="2776">H.R. 2776</bill>, the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2007, which we passed in August. However, I am concerned that this legislation still contains provisions repealing tax incentives for oil and gas companies which may have a negative effect on access to important sources of energy. In particular, I am concerned that the domestic manufacturing deduction could discourage new domestic  oil and natural gas investment by making these investments comparatively less competitive than competing foreign investments. Moving forward, I think it would be prudent for this Congress to consider linking an increase on taxes with an increase in access to domestic exploration of available sources of energy, such as the gulf coast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to be balanced and prudent in their approach in addressing our energy needs. By investing in renewable energy and increasing access to potential sources of energy, I believe we can be partners with responsible members of America's energy producing community in our collective goal of reaching energy independence.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400177" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is an old saying that says, in order to travel a thousand miles you have got to take the first step. And this is the first step that we are taking on a long road to energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is such an important issue, energy independence, and there are almost too many people to thank for putting this first step together. But I want to begin by thanking the environmental groups and the automobile industry for coming together on a compromise on CAFE standards. For the first time in 32 years, we are actually increasing the fuel efficiencies that car manufacturers must adhere to in terms of making a car that travels on better fuel efficiencies. That standard has been raised to  35 miles per gallon. And this is a very tough standard to attain, but one that the automobile industry says that they can do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said, for the first time in 32 years we have these new standards in place, and I think that is a major, major accomplishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to travel the other thousand miles, we have got a lot more things to do and we have time to do it to make us energy independent. But I would like to take the opportunity to thank the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, who comes from automobile land in Michigan, for stepping forth and making sure that these new standards were to become law. Nothing short of big compliments to  him for stepping up to the plate and making sure that  we move forward on these new standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a new day. This is a good energy bill, one that we are going to pass today. These new CAFE standards are something that we should all be proud of, and I would again like to thank my coauthor on the bill that I introduced, Lee Terry from the great State of Nebraska, for helping us move this piece of legislation forward.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>We have about 1 trillion barrels of recoverable known reserves. The undiscovered reserves are going to be a relatively small fraction of that. If we could pump those undiscovered reserves tomorrow, what would we do the day after tomorrow? And there will be a day after tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have 10 kids, 16 grandkids and two great grandkids. We are leaving them a horrendous debt, although not with my votes. Wouldn't it be nice to leave them a little oil? I am not anxious to find and exploit these undiscovered reserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I really would like to vote for this bill, because we desperately need an energy bill. The world, and particularly the United States, faces a real challenge on energy in the future. I cannot vote for this bill primarily because of the corn ethanol mandate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent article in The Economist noted that our use of corn for ethanol doubled the price of corn about 1 year ago. Farmers then moved lands that would have been in soybeans and wheat to corn. We have now further increased the cost of corn, and we have increased the cost of soybeans and wheat the world around. One of the members of the United Nations said that what we have done is a crime against humanity. And the effect we have had on gasoline use has been absolutely trifling. The National  Academy of Sciences says if we converted all of our corn to ethanol and discounted for fossil fuel input, it would displace 2.4 percent of our gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this really represents one of those times, as the old farmer says, that the juice ain't worth the squeezing. We can do better.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, when you look at this bill, the question you should ask: Has this been tried before and has it been successful?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corn ethanol is not an efficient fuel, as mentioned by the previous speaker. Even if the Nation's entire corn crop was used for ethanol, it would replace only 12 percent of current gasoline use. Worse, taxpayers will pay twice for ethanol: at the pump; but, more importantly, billions of dollars for these dollars through subsidies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you go into the European Union, you ask, How is it working over there? Well, there is a report. October 2007 Report "Leaping Before They Looked. Lessons From Europe's Experience With the 2003 Biofuel Directive," by the Clean Air Task Force states that a 2003 European Union mandate to increase and promote the use of biofuel has exacerbated some of the very problems it was designed to solve, driving up food prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So my colleagues, this makes the problem worse, driving up food prices, leading to increased deforestation in tropical countries, worsening global warming and increasing imports of bio-oils.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is a report from the European Union which is trying to do the same thing you are trying to suggest in this bill. It did not work there and probably won't work here in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I would conclude that the cellulosic biofuel credits is really based on something that is totally not science driven.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I ask my colleagues to vote "no" on this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, which will help our Nation take a major step towards energy independence. This legislation is truly historic, and I commend all of the sponsors and all who had a hand in bringing this legislation to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot dig or drill our way out of our energy crisis. We need a better way. We need new strategies to develop sources of energy that will move our Nation away from our reliance on oil and gas. This legislation will benefit our environment by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, our economy by creating new industries and jobs, and our national security by reducing our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly pleased that <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> includes the first significant increase in automobile fuel economy standards in a generation. We have the technology to make our vehicles more efficient, and it is past time that we do so. While I wish that the bill retained the renewable electricity standards and the tax provisions that the House passed, I will keep working with my colleagues to see those efforts someday become law in the very near future.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, especially since I am going to speak in favor of the bill. And the reason I am going to speak in favor of the bill and vote for it is because I think it is the beginning of a commitment to doing something about our energy dependence on foreign fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, I had the opportunity to be in Brazil. In the 1970s, Brazil made a commitment to move away from their dependence on imported oil and they developed ethanol from sugarcane. We don't have sugarcane, but we have something else that is in this bill. We have hydrogen, lots of it. In fact, it is the world's most common element.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So within this bill is the H Prize, which rewards entrepreneurs and inventors who can come up with a well-to-wheels transformation toward the hydrogen economy with a $10 million prize, hopefully augmented by $40 million worth of private money. This is patterned after the Ansari X Prize which incentivized entrepreneurial space flight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we would hope to accomplish with the H Prize, which House Members have voted twice in favor of with over 400 votes both times, is to break through to hydrogen. I support the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for allowing me to come in and weigh in on this important measure. I am proud today to vote for this comprehensive energy package which includes two bills that I introduced related to enhancing biofuels and also industrial efficiency research and development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Diversifying our energy supplies will help our Nation lead the way toward greater energy independence. However, we must commit to even more research and development in order to remain the world leader that we have been. We are competing with China and Japan and Russia and many other nations to find new resources and technologies. As we grow our technologies, we grow the availability of resources that we are trying to seek and use. And if we don't rededicate our Nation's know-how and might to  the pursuit of science and technologies, I believe we will relegate ourselves to second-class status in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this bill will not bring down energy prices overnight, it is an important step in the right direction. Estimates show that these provisions will  save Americans more than $400 billion and reduce energy consumption by at least 7 percent by 2030. We can achieve that and more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation has reached a critical point, and the time is now for us to lead the way toward cleaner fuel, increased efficiency standards, and much-needed research and development. When we lead, we prosper. Passing this bill is a start. Making it better next year and the year after will ensure our leadership in the world.

  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we don't get elected to come to Congress and be against things. As the chairman of the Energy Committee in the last Congress, I was honored to chair the conference committee which passed the most comprehensive energy bill to become law in the last 20 to 30 years, so it is with a heavy heart that I come to the floor today to oppose this particular energy bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't oppose it out of spite and I don't oppose it because there is a different majority; I oppose it because of what is in it and what is not in it. Let's talk about what's not in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is nothing in it for coal to liquids. There is nothing in it for the domestic oil and gas industry. There is very little in it for the nuclear industry. So for all of the conventional energy sources that fuel this great Nation, this is basically a no-energy bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are not a have-not Nation in terms of energy. We have the ability, if we wish to, to be close to self-sufficient in energy production for our own consumption in this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hypothetically, this bill may do something to reduce the amount of oil that we import, but only hypothetically. We use about 12 million barrels of oil per day that is converted to gasoline, and my guess is, in the year 2020, we are going to use more than 12 million barrels of oil a day to convert to gasoline and diesel fuel. So while it will certainly save some energy, because of the growth, I would argue that we will probably end up using as much imported oil as we do today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this bill really is is a recipe for recession. Why do I say that? The cost of fuel is going to go up if this bill does what it is supposed to do, and that is going to be an incentive for recession. The cost of building our homes is going to go up because of all of the new building code restrictions for so-called green buildings in this bill. The cost of electricity is going to go up. The cost of manufacturing our automobiles and our trucks is going to go up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1966, my father's Ford Fairlane 500 got 17 miles to the gallon. It cost about $4,000 in 1966 dollars. That equivalent vehicle today would cost, in the order of magnitude, $25,000. The vehicles that are going to be made to meet this 35-mile-per-gallon standard in the year 2020 are probably going to cost, in order of magnitude, $10,000 to $15,000 more than they do today. That is a recipe for recession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cost of appliances is going to go up because of all of the new efficiency standards we are putting in for appliances. And even the cost of light bulbs is going to go up. The light bulbs that light this Chamber right now will be illegal when this bill becomes completely implemented. The incandescent light bulb that you can get for 90 cents or 50 cents at Wal-Mart is going to be outlawed. You will have to pay $8 to $10 for these new fancy light bulbs. That is a cause for recession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what happens when all of these costs go up, Mr. Speaker? Jobs go down. Jobs in our real estate and home construction building are going to go down. Jobs in manufacturing are going to go down. Jobs in our automobile assembly industry are going to go down. Jobs in retail sales are going to go down. Costs are going to go up and jobs are going to go down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the shame of it is that we could have passed an energy bill in this Congress that we could have all voted for. We could have put some of the things that are in this bill. We are not opposed to some increase in CAFE. We could have had an agreement on CAFE that balanced an increase in supply perhaps by drilling in ANWR so we get more oil production domestically, we get some energy conservation domestically. That is a doable deal. We could have done a coal-to-liquids title in this bill. Vote</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, for his kind words and for his tremendous leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of his leadership and that of 10 other Members, Chairs of our committees of jurisdiction, working in a bipartisan way, we are able to bring earth-shattering change in terms of energy policy to the floor of the House. Here we are today. Here we are today to pass a bill that passed in the Senate 88-6; 88-6, very strong bipartisan support for this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today in the House, we have the opportunity to give that same kind of validation and legitimacy to a new direction in energy security for America. It is about our national security. Admiral McGinn, when he spoke recently, said that our dependence on foreign oil presents a clear and present danger to our country. It is a matter of our national economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Vel&#xE1;zquez, Chair of the Small Business Committee, and Congressman George Miller, with the Green Jobs Initiatives, can show a new way to build a new economy involving many more people and the new technologies that will be unleashed because of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>It's about protecting our environment. Congressman Rahall, Chairman Rahall and his Natural Resources Committee provided great leadership, as did the Chair of the Government Reform Committee, Mr. Waxman, who has long been a supporter of energy security and energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The list goes on: Mr. Oberstar, the greening of the Capitol and the Federal buildings across the country and what that will save, and many more initiatives that he has presented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee provided the way to pay for it. That was rejected in the Senate, but we will revisit that issue in a manner that I think will receive strong bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairman of our select committee, Mr. Markey, did an excellent job in keeping this issue alive, as he has worked on it for many, many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What other Chairs? I'm looking around the room at our Chairs. I'll talk about them as we go along.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Bart Gordon, Chair of the Science and Technology Committee, is really in the forefront. So much of this bill comes out of his committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the work that was done by the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell, is breaking ground. It's groundbreaking in terms of what it will do in savings to the consumer, what it is doing in terms of protecting the environment, and, again, what it is doing to provide a new direction. And it does so in a way that breaks ground but does not leave it broken. It takes us to a new place, and I thank him for that leadership. It's a tremendous addition  to this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the United States Senate, two of their major provisions, renewable fuel portfolio, and the CAFE, were leadership issues, and I'm glad that we were able to work out those, reconcile the differences between the House and the Senate, again with the leadership of Mr. Dingell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think of us as being in a place where we're looking at the horizon, whether we're on a ship, or wherever we are, looking at a horizon. And this legislation takes us closer to that horizon. But as with all horizons, they keep getting farther away. But they lead us and reaching for it takes us to a whole new world. And that's what this legislation does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues in this Chamber, our guests. Am I allowed to address them, Mr. Speaker? You are present at a moment of change, of real change, of rejecting the past, respecting the values of the past, but rejecting the insistence that we stay in the past and go into the future. This is about a choice between yesterday and tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while I would have liked to have had the full package that passed here with overwhelming bipartisan support in the House, I salute this bill for what it does do and respect it for that, rather than judge it for what it does not, because we have plenty of time, interest, knowledge, know-how and bipartisanship to move forward to make even more change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's, as I said, a national security issue. It's an economic issue, an environmental issue and therefore a health issue. It is an energy issue, and it is a moral issue. It's a moral issue, and that's why we worked closely with the evangelical and faith-based communities, with scientists and faith-based, with business and environmentalists, with our friends in labor who support this legislation, to preserve God's beautiful legacy to us. It is His gift to us, and we have a moral responsibility  to preserve it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to think about our consumers every single day. That's who we represent. They are our bosses, and their well-being is our mission, to protect their well-being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will save the average driver who goes up to the pump and has the shock that consumers are having, this legislation alone will save the average driver between $700 and $1,000 per year. It adds up to $22 billion in net annual consumer savings in the year 2020.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to reduce the price at the pump, the increasing of the fuel efficiency standards to 35 miles per gallon is historic. It's the first time in 32 years that this has happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So whether we're thinking as consumers and very personally about what this means in the lives of our constituents as they see their energy costs go up at the pump or in heating their homes at this Christmas season, or we're thinking of our national defense and our national economy, this is as personal as each and every one of our consumers. It is as global as the planet, and the opportunity provided to take us to a new horizon, to see a new world, a new era of possibility is here with us today.  I hope, as a Christmas present to our constituents and, especially to the children, because it's about their future, that we would have very, very strong bipartisan support for this legislation. In the Senate, as I said, 88-6, a beautiful vote. I hope that we can replicate that in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In any event, this great opportunity for us would not have been possible without the leadership of you, Mr. Chairman, so many of our chairmen, including the gentleman in the Chair, working from the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey, and so many others of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I salute our chairmen for the intellect, the institutional memory, the legislative know-how that they brought to this process, I also want to give a special thank you to our freshman class. They came to this Congress to make change. They know how essential protecting our planet is. They know the concerns of their constituents. They're fresh out of the trenches, dealing with them. And without that freshman class, if I may call them freshmen, we would not have had the success that we have had  today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this has been a collaboration on both sides of the aisle, from our most senior Members to our newest Members of Congress, to invigorate us, to encourage us to make the change that we're making today. I'm absolutely delighted about it. I can't wait until we join with the President of the United States when he signs this legislation into law and takes a step forward into the future.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400400" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Chairman DINGELL, BARON HILL, JOHN CAMPBELL and others for their assistance in negotiating the landmark fuel economy provisions in this bill. Without the hard work of these Members, we would not have been able to reform our Nation's fuel economy standards in a manner that increases fuel economy by 40 percent while preserving jobs and vehicle choice. The Hill-Terry fuel economy reforms will reduce overall gasoline consumption and its attendant  carbon emissions, goals that Members of both parties support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also has strong energy efficiency provisions, which like the Hill-Terry fuel economy reforms, will reduce demand for energy in the long term. While I support and will vote for the bill for these reasons, I am extremely disappointed this bill does nothing to address the supply side of energy. By not addressing the supply side of energy security, this bill is woefully deficient in preparing America for a future in which our energy supply must grow to continue supporting our domestic manufacturing  base, as well as a future and present where other nations are locked in an ongoing competition around the world to secure energy resources for the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud that the Hill-Terry fuel economy reforms will help reduce the amount of gasoline our Nation imports. I am also proud of the increased renewable fuels standard, which will encourage more production of ethanol and biodiesel to further reduce demand for foreign imports. But these provisions coupled with energy efficiency measures are not enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To truly address the energy challenges our Nation will face in the future, we must embrace every available technology at our disposal. Given the majority's concern for carbon emissions, I am surprised they oppose further development of our Nation's nuclear power industry. Nuclear power is cheap, produces no emissions, generates good jobs and is a net benefit to the communities in which plants are located.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the bill ignores America's greatest natural resource: coal. It is no understatement that Illinois is the Saudi Arabia of coal. Combined with coal resources in other States, our Nation has enough coal to supply all of America's energy needs for in excess of 150 years. Yet the bill contains no provisions to promote the use of coal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I realize that when most Americans think of coal plants, images of black smoke emerging from dirty stacks come to mind. That is the coal industry of yesterday. Today's coal industry has been moving towards using cleaner coal, which produces less sulfur and nitrogen, and scientists around the world are developing technologies to make coal even cleaner and to reduce its carbon emissions. Technologies currently being researched and improved that accomplish these goals are carbon capture and sequestration,  CCS, and Integrated Gasification Combined Cycles, IGCC. CCS captures carbon emissions at the source and then either pumps it deep underground where it is capped, or pumps it into partially depleted oilfields to force the oil closer to the surface and make domestic oil recovery cheaper, thus also increasing our domestic oil supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coal can also be used to produce motor and aviation fuel through coal-to-liquids technology, which this bill does nothing to support. This technology is based on the Fischer-Tropes process developed early in the 20th century. South Africa derives over 30 percent of its energy needs from Fischer-Tropes produced fuels. Using the Fischer-Tropes process, America could be well on the way to producing motor and aviation fuel with fewer emissions than are produced by a typical gasoline refinery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opponents of using coal for any reason will say that these technologies are not fully developed or cost-effective enough for our Nation to adopt them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ironically, many of these are the same people who support the Hill-Terry fuel economy reforms even though meeting these new  standards will require industry to increase investment in and development of new technologies to meet the 35 mpg by 2020 goal set out by this energy bill. If the U.S. auto industry can do this in 12 years, there is no reason that similar technology can't be developed in the same timeframe by utility and coal companies. And best  of all, opening new CTL refineries will create jobs both in the new refineries, and in associated industries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, just this week there were news reports that an American chemical company is moving some production overseas due to the difference in energy costs here compared with costs in their new host nation. By not increasing our domestic energy supply, our Nation is essentially asking U.S. companies to leave our shores and eliminate American jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage our distinguished Chairman, JOHN DINGELL, to work with Speaker PELOSI and the Democrat Leadership to enact a second energy bill this Congress, which focuses on increasing the supply of U.S. energy in order to protect our national manufacturing base and maintain good-paying U.S. jobs.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today is a historic day, as America takes a big step forward in combating global climate change and breaking the grip that "Big Oil" companies and OPEC have on our Nation. That is why I am pleased to rise in support of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007--a bill that will put us on a path to energy independence, while creating millions of new jobs and addressing climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America has always been at the forefront of technological breakthroughs. We have responded to great challenges, perhaps most famously President John F. Kennedy's challenge to land a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s. I am confident that this legislation will provide America with the momentum it needs to move our country into a new energy economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, I am disappointed that the other body was unable to retain the House-passed language to repeal tax breaks for the oil and gas industry. Especially at a time of record high gas prices and record high corporate profits, this excessively prosperous industry should be paying its fair share. This revenue is needed to fund clean, renewable energies like wind, solar, and geothermal, as well as other important advanced technologies like plug-in electric vehicles, which will speed our path  to energy independence. I will continue this fight against "Big Oil" and work to break the death grip that they have on American consumers. And I will continue to push for billions of dollars in tax incentives to jumpstart our cutting-edge renewable energy industries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also not happy with the removal of the Renewable Electricity Standard from the final bill. This provision, which would have required utilities to generate 15 percent of electricity from renewable sources by 2020, would have gone a very long way in reducing America's addiction to fossil fuels. With most States already pursuing renewable electricity portfolios, including an Illinois mandate of 25 percent by 2025, I will work to make sure Congress addresses this issue soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As vice-chairman of the Science and Technology Committee, I am pleased to have played an important role in not only getting this bill passed, but also in contributing two important provisions. The H-Prize Act of 2007, a bill I introduced with Representative INGLIS of South Carolina, establishes over $50 million in competitively awarded cash prizes to spur innovations that advance the use of hydrogen as a fuel for transportation. While hydrogen-fueled cars already exist, there are significant  technical and economic barriers that must still be overcome before we can put a hydrogen car in every American garage. The H-Prize will help expand the possibilities of hydrogen research, promoting people not normally involved in federal research and development to explore one of the greatest challenges facing us today. And when</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also very happy about the inclusion of the BRIGHT (Bulb Replacement In Government with High-Efficiency Technology) Energy Savings Act, which I introduced and shepherded through the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. This provision requires the federal government--the Nation's largest energy consumer--to use high-efficiency light bulbs in 1,800 civilian office buildings. This change will significantly reduce energy consumption--about 75 percent savings for each of more than 3 million  bulbs--saving tens of millions of taxpayer dollars, in addition to saving energy and cutting down on the emissions of greenhouse gases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this groundbreaking legislation. This is not a perfect bill, and I will work to make sure we revisit this issue, especially the repeal of the taxes on "Big Oil." But this is a great step forward for America and for our environment. I am confident that one day we will look back on this bill as that catalyst that led to a better, cleaner, more secure America and world.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400412" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will vote for this legislation, though I am deeply disappointed that it does not include several key provisions from the bill that the House passed earlier this month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The earlier version was an excellent energy bill that combined provisions developed by several different House Committees, as well as provisions from a Senate-passed bill, designed to start putting our country on a path toward energy independence, increased national security and economic growth, and addressing global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate lacked the votes to even consider that energy bill, so it was then stripped of the Renewable Electricity Standard that I championed in the House along with Representatives TOM UDALL and TODD PLATTS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House's adoption of that amendment earlier this year, and its retention in the most recent House-passed version, was a high point for those of us working for positive change that will benefit rural communities, save consumers money, reduce air pollution, and increase reliability and energy security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, to make matters even worse, even after that provision was dropped, for lack of just one more vote in the Senate, what remained of the House bill had to be further deformed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, for lack of just one more Senate vote, the bill we are considering today does not extend important tax credits for renewable energy production, such as the extension of the Production Tax Credit for solar and wind energy and other renewable technologies. The PTC in particular has been critical in promoting the creation of a renewable energy industry, and I will work to win an extension of this key tax credit before the current credit expires at the end of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And dropped with the tax credits were the House-passed provisions dealing with the Secure Rural Schools and Payments-in-Lieu-of-Taxes (PILT) program. Both would have been good for the Nation and particularly for Colorado because so many of our counties include large Federal land areas and therefore would have benefited directly from that part of the House-passed bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly supported all those provisions, and I intend to continue working to win their enactment either on their own or as part of some other measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I regret that for the time being Congress is not able to do all that should be done to move us toward greater energy independence, which means greater national security, in ways that will lower energy costs, help our economy, and reduce the carbon emissions that contribute to climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nonetheless, with all its shortcomings, the bill the Senate has sent us will accomplish some worthwhile things and deserves to be passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Notably, it includes the first revision in decades of the fuel-consumption standards for automobiles. This step is long overdue and will result in increasing the efficiency of all vehicles to 35 miles per gallon by 2020.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also glad to note that it retains a provision on carbon capture and storage based upon a bill that I authored (<bill type="h" number="1933">H.R. 1933</bill>). Coal and other fossil fuels have been and will continue to be an important energy source for our country, but coal-burning power plants are also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. The carbon capture and storage research, development, and demonstration program authorized in this bill will help us tackle this challenge while keeping our economy  healthy and strong. It will authorize the Department of Energy to conduct demonstration projects for both carbon dioxide capture and carbon dioxide injection and storage. Not only will this research program help us develop this technology and make it more-economical, but it will also help us understand the implications of storing large amounts of carbon dioxide underground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, this bill will encourage manufacturers to build more efficient appliances, strengthen the energy efficiency of the Federal Government, and help businesses create energy-efficient workplaces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it will increase the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS), which sets annual requirements for the amount of renewable fuels produced and used in motor vehicles. The new RFS has specific requirements for the use of biodiesel and cellulosic sources to ensure that these ethanol sources also advance along with corn-based ethanol. Furthermore, the bill includes critical environmental safeguards to ensure that the growth of homegrown fuels helps to reduce carbon emissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the bill will create an Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Worker Training Program to train Americans for good "green" jobs--such as in solar panel manufacturing and green building construction--that  will be created by new renewable-energy and energy-efficiency initiatives. This will provide training opportunities to our veterans, to those displaced by national energy and environmental policy and economic globalization, to individuals  seeking pathways out of poverty, to young people at risk and to workers already in the energy field who need to update their skills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed with this legislation because it came so close to being so much better. But, the bottom line is that even so it is much needed and long overdue and deserves to pass today so it can go to the president to be signed into law. I urge its approval.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400253" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, over the past 7 years, I have labored to increase the fuel economy standards of our cars and light truck fleets, and am gratified that the day has finally come where the fruits of my labor will be realized. Over 7 years, there are countless individuals, Members of Congress, environmental, consumer, and religious organizations who have labored alongside me--these people are too numerous to mention. I thank all of them for their important contributions. But I would also  like to thank several in particular.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, former Congressman Sherwood Boehlert, R-NY, who for six years was my partner in the House, advocating tirelessly, often against the wishes of his party's leadership, to move this issue forward. Second, Dan Becker, an environmental consultant, who has made raising fuel economy standards his life's work and who worked with my office in the trenches back when the trenches were a very lonely place to be! Finally, Securing America's Future Energy and the Energy Security Leadership Council,  who brought together retired military officials and corporate CEOs to highlight the national and economic security dangers associated with our growing dependence on imported oil, and who played a critical role in developing more widespread support for these provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the principal House proponent of the fuel economy Title in this legislation, I also wish to briefly discuss several of its provisions in order to more fully explain the statutory language and to provide context for what we are accomplishing with this historic energy bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 3 of the bill states: "Except to the extent expressly provided in this Act, or in an amendment made by this Act, nothing in this Act or an amendment made by this act supersedes, limits the authority or responsibility conferred by, or authorizes any violation of any provision of law (including a regulation), including any energy or environmental law or regulation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The laws and regulations referred to in section 3 include, but are not limited to, the Clean Air Act and any regulations promulgated under Clean Air Act authority. It is the intent of Congress to fully preserve existing federal and State authority under the Clean Air Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Congress does not intend, by including provisions in Title I of the bill that reform and alter the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to increase fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, non-passenger automobiles, work trucks, and medium and heavy duty trucks, to in any way supersede or limit the authority and/or responsibility conferred by sections 177, 202, and 209 of the Clean Air Act. For section 202 of the Clean Air Act, this includes but is not limited to  the authority and responsibility affirmed by the Supreme Court's April 2, 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, No. 05-1120. For sections 177 and 209 of the Clean Air Act, this includes but is not limited to the authority affirmed by the September 12, 2007 decision of the U.S. District Court for the District</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Senators LEVIN, INOUYE and FEINSTEIN, in a December 13, 2007 colloquy, agreed that it was the "intent of this bill that any regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency be consistent with the direction of Congress in this legislation and regulations issued by the Department of Transportation to implement this legislation," in fact this legislation includes no statutory requirement that would compel the Environmental Protection Agency to adopt regulations  that are consistent with those promulgated by the Department of Transportation. I would also note that in a subsequent colloquy, Senator INOUYE stated that "the DOT and the EPA have separate missions that should be executed fully and responsibly," and Senator FEINSTEIN stated that "Importantly,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title I of the bill addresses CAFE standards. Section 102(a) would require that the fleet of new passenger and non-passenger vehicles made for sale in model year 2020 reach a fleet-wide fuel economy average of at least 35 miles per gallon, regardless of shifts in the market or any other consideration. While fuel economy standards for each of model years 2011-2019 are expected to be the maximum feasible standard, this section does not allow the Department of Transportation, DOT, to set a fleet-wide  average of lower than 35 miles per gallon for model year 2020 under any circumstances. In addition, if the maximum feasible level for model year 2020 is higher than 35 miles per gallon due to technological progress and/or other factors, Congress intends to require DOT to set standards at the maximum feasible level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also the intent of this section to require DOT to set interim standards between 2011 and 2019 to make rapid and consistent annual progress towards achieving the 35 mpg minimum by 2020. In asking for "ratable" progress, the intent of Congress is to seek relatively consistent proportional increases in fuel economy standards each year, such that no single year through 2020 should experience a significantly higher increase than the previous year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 104 addresses credit trading among and within automakers' vehicle fleets and is intended to increase flexibility for automakers, but it is the intent of Congress that any trading not in any way reduce the oil savings achieved by the standards set for any year under this title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 105 is intended to provide added information for consumers, but is not intended to in any way interfere with or diminish EPA labeling authority. Congress intends that DOT work closely with EPA in fulfilling the requirements of this section.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 106 is intended to clarify that Title I does not impact fuel economy standards or the standard-setting process for vehicles manufactured before model year 2011. This section is not intended to codify, or otherwise support or reject, any standards applying before model year 2011 , and is not intended to reverse, supersede, overrule, or in any way limit the November 15, 2007 decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Center for Biological Diversity v. National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration, No. 06-71891.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 109 makes modifications to the cap on the credits allowed to manufacturers making dual-fuel vehicles to ensure that the dual-fuel vehicle credit program is phased out and is fully and permanently eliminated by 2020 and thereafter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the Secretary to pay careful heed to the intent and spirit of these provisions in carrying out the provisions of this Title, so that we achieve this legislation's goals of increasing the fuel efficiency of our cars, SUVs, and other vehicles.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400387" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of increasing fuel efficiency and taking the first steps toward ending our costly addiction to fossil fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Energy Independence and Security Act, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, will provide much needed increases in energy efficiency and investments in clean energy and green buildings. Most importantly, for the first time in a generation, this bill will raise the fuel economy, CAFE, standards for new cars and trucks. By increasing CAFE to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 this bill will reduce oil consumption by 1.1 million barrels a day in 2020. This is the equivalent of taking 28 million vehicles off the road. Although I  believe we can and should get to 35 mpg faster, this bill represents real progress in our efforts to combat global warming and achieve energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no secret that our addiction to oil and coal is having increasingly dire consequences for our Nation and the planet. The price of oil hovers near $100 a barrel. An endless war continues to rage in Iraq while the President continues his saber rattling in the direction of Iran. The specter of catastrophic global warming becomes more real each day. The time to take action is now and this legislation is a good starting point, but we must do more. I agree with the numerous economists and environmentalists  who think an aggressive carbon tax is the only sure way to make the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that are needed to reduce global warming. A carbon tax must be part of the conversation as we move forward with comprehensive global warming legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is not perfect. Republican obstructionists in the Senate have stripped provisions to mandate production of electricity from renewable sources like wind, solar, and biomass. They also demanded that giant oil companies maintain their preferential tax status. I am also troubled that we are continuing to subsidize and ratchet up production of corn- based ethanol, which will do little to ease global warming, but drives up food prices and contributes  to water pollution. I hope that the environmental safeguards contained in the Renewable Fuel Standard--which mandates production of 36 billion gallons of biofuels by 2022--will quickly push production away from corn ethanol and toward advanced cellulosic fuels. In the meantime, we have a responsibility to protect families hit by rising food prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these shortcomings, this legislation represents real progress for both consumers and the environment. I urge all of my colleagues to embrace this new direction in energy policy and vote "yes." We must realize that this bill is only the beginning and that more fundamental changes are needed if we are serious about addressing global warming and energy independence.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400415" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of what I hope and expect will be the final version of this year's energy bill. While less comprehensive than the legislation passed by the House, it is nevertheless an historic accomplishment and worthy of this chamber's support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the first time in thirty-two years, we are increasing the corporate average fuel economy, CAFE, standard for cars and trucks to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. This single step will create 150,000 jobs, save consumers $22 billion at the pump and slash our nation's oil consumption by 1.1 million barrels a day--about half what we currently import from the Persian Gulf. Additionally, and importantly, this improved standard is the greenhouse gas equivalent of taking 28 million cars and trucks off  the road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To further reduce our dependence on foreign oil, this package includes a Renewable Fuels Standard, RFS, that expands our nation's domestic biofuel production to 36 billion gallons by 2022. I am especially pleased that this RFS includes a substantial requirement for advanced biofuels from a variety of different feedstocks, as well as robust environmental protections necessary to safeguard vital ecosystems like the Chesapeake Bay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this legislation achieves meaningful efficiency improvements across the economy, makes government a part of the energy solution, and accelerates our research and development efforts into the clean, renewable energy technologies of the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a sponsor of the Renewable Electricity Standard, RES, and a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I am disappointed that the House-passed RES and tax provisions have been stripped from this bill. Nevertheless, we can be justifiably proud of what we are accomplishing today--and I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle until the rest of the job is done.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. This agreement with the Senate builds on the New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act passed this summer. The ambitious legislation before us today, which includes wide-ranging solutions from 10 House committees, invests in the future of America and puts our Nation on a path toward energy independence. It will strengthen national security, lower  energy costs, grow our economy, create new jobs, and begin to reduce the threat of global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Energy Independence and Security Act includes several provisions that will strengthen our national security by decreasing our dependence on foreign oil. All told, this legislation will slash U.S. oil consumption by over 4 million barrels per day by 2030--more than twice our current daily imports from the Persian Gulf. I want to applaud Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Dingell for reaching an agreement on fuel economy standards that is supported by both environmentalists and the  automobile industry. This bill will raise CAFE standards for new cars and trucks to 35 miles per gallon by 2020--the first increase in 32 years. It ensures that this fuel economy standard will be reached, while offering flexibility to automakers and ensuring that we keep American manufacturing jobs and continue domestic production of smaller vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's legislation puts us on a path to reducing global warming. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 24 percent of the total amount the U.S. needs to cut by 2030 to help save the planet. The bill increases the efficiency of buildings, homes, appliances, and lighting. It also makes a historic commitment to American homegrown renewable energy that reduces greenhouse gas emissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today will also lower energy costs and create new American jobs. Increased vehicle fuel efficiency will save American families $700 to $1,000 a year at the pump, producing $22 billion in net annual savings for consumers in 2020. The building, appliance, and lighting efficiency provisions will save consumers $400 billion through 2030. In addition, by expanding American-grown biofuels to 36 billion gallons in 2022 and supporting cutting-edge energy research, the bill will help  create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. It also provides job training that will prepare workers for 3 million new "green" jobs over 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long, our country has lagged behind the rest of the industrialized world in recognizing and taking action to address the climate change crisis. Global warming endangers all of us, but threatens to have the most devastating impact on the poorest and the most vulnerable. Our Nation is the richest in the world and one of the largest contributors to global warming, yet, until today, it has not made any substantial efforts towards addressing the problem. I am proud to join with my colleagues  as we at long last put America on the path to becoming part of the solution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400113" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker. I am deeply disappointed that the final version of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, passed today by the House, did not contain a reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act, which compensates counties for the large amounts of land the Federal Government took from them to create the National Forest System. This loss of land weakened the counties' tax bases, leaving them without adequate funding to provide basic public services such as schools and roads.  The county payments authorized under the act fulfill a promise the Federal Government made when the land was seized. As the first session of the 110th Congress draws to a close, leaving these payments to expire, that promise is once again being broken, and the basic public infrastructures of our rural counties are left to suffer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In California, State law requires that layoff notices be issued to teachers and administrators by March 15 if the proper resources are not available in their budgets. Once layoff notices are issued, schools begin to experience adverse effects of the funding shortage even if the money is eventually recovered, which was the case this year. This means Congress will have a very short time to act in the new year, and I will continue to be a strong advocate for passing legislation that fulfills our  commitment to rural counties. This language should have remained in the energy bill currently before Congress, and its omission is the primary reason for my opposition to the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the harm that is caused by failing to provide county payments in this bill, I am concerned that the bill excludes biomass from Federal lands as an alternative source of fuel. Much of my district is owned by the United States Forest Service, and these areas are prone to wildfires due to the large buildup of forest fuels. I have encouraged the removal of these materials, which serves the duel purpose of providing energy produced at nearby biomass plants and making our forests less  prone to catastrophic wildfires. By exempting biomass from Federal lands as a source of alternative energy, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> misses an opportunity to exploit a large source of alternative fuels while leaving our forests vulnerable to great harm from potential wildfires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is imperative that Congress pass legislation to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act before school boards meet in February to discuss where cuts must be made. Furthermore, we must encourage development of alternative fuels such as biomass which are abundant and carry with them additional benefits. <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> misses an opportunity to accomplish both those goals.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400103" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while today's Consolidated Appropriations bill falls far short, the Democratic Congress has made sure it is far better than the President's budget request for fiscal year 2008. We have made very real changes to the administration's original budget proposal, and made real responsible investment in new domestic priorities that are long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite absurd limitations imposed by the administration and from Republican obstructionists in Congress, we have fought to meet our obligations as a Nation and a congress. Getting our work done when we are supposed to, and getting the big things right. Yet, while we worked to find common ground, the administration played political games.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Still, as chair of the FDA Agriculture Subcommittee I am proud of the bill we put together under tremendous constraints:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reinvesting in rural America--restoring $44 million for rural business enterprise and opportunity grants, $119 million over the President's request for critical water and waste programs to ensure rural areas have access to clean water, and $20.3 million for community facility grants to help rural areas build day care centers and police and fire stations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Protecting public health, increasing FDA funding by $145 million over 2007; $56 million for FDA food safety activities, with $28 million withheld until July 1 pending the submission of a comprehensive food safety plan by the FDA. A $21 million increase for drug safety and $6 million more for the FDA's Office of Generic Drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has $633 million above the President's request for the WIC nutrition program; and $472 million above for bio-energy and renewable energy R&amp;D, including loans and grants in rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is about meeting our commitment to the American people. And, although at a much lower level, this bill finally funds our domestic priorities: from rural development to local law enforcement, Pell grants to No Child Left Behind. A new direction with new priorities for our Nation--the American people demand nothing less.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. As an original co-sponsor of this legislation, I am grateful for all of the hard work that went into bringing this bill to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, many businesses were no longer able to purchase insurance to protect against property losses that might occur in any future terrorist attacks and most reinsurers have yet to return to the marketplace because of the difficulty of being able to predict the frequency, size and scope of future terrorist attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The backstop TRIA providesprotects those who buy insurance, and allows our economy to continue functioning normally in the face of the terrorist threat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my view, the bill's coverage of acts of domestic terrorism is a prudent step. However, I am disappointed we did not take this opportunity to make further reforms to the program such as the inclusion of reinsurance for group life insurers, who face the same challenges as property, casualty or other insurers. Failure to include I group life has placed these insurers in a difficult position of exiting from the market or choosing to remain in the marketplace without reinsurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is, this is a good bill worthy of our support. It will bring some certainty to the insurance markets and help protect our economy. We need to pass this bill.</paragraph>
