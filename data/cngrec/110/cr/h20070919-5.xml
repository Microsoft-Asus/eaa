    <paragraph>Thank you, Madam Speaker, and good morning to all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a privilege and honor today to welcome a dear friend of mine, Father Richard Estrada, who traveled from Los Angeles to be here to provide the House with its opening prayer. I am delighted to present Father Estrada to my colleagues, and I want to thank him for taking the time to be here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, it is fitting to have Father Estrada serve as guest chaplain. Father Estrada has dedicated his entire life to serving those less fortunate than us, particularly the homeless and at-risk youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is the founder and executive director of Jovenes, Inc., a nonprofit organization which serves the homeless and at-risk immigrant youth and other disadvantaged individuals from the East Los Angeles area. He is the associate pastor at Our Lady Queen of Angels Catholic Church, La Placita, the oldest church probably in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Father Estrada received a bachelor of arts degree from the University of San Francisco and studied theology and pastoral counseling at the Graduate School of Theology in Berkeley, California, the Mexican American Cultural Center in San Antonio, Texas, and the Fred C. Neiles School in Whittier, California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his advocacy on behalf of the homeless and young people, Father Estrada is a champion for the humane treatment of all immigrants and their families. In fact, I recall him asking me to go with him across the border to place bottles of water for those immigrants that were dying in the fields and in the desert.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to welcome Father Richard to the House today. We have before us a great man of honor and compassion.</paragraph>
