    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, you cannot run America on the cheap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the wake of Katrina, we learned that years of requests for investment in infrastructure and basic human needs had been ignored. After sending our troops into Iraq, we learned that they lacked basic protective equipment because this administration was looking to save pennies even as it was wasting billions of dollars on private contracts run amok.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the scandal at Walter Reed Hospital is revealing that behind the curtain even our neediest veterans are not being spared the double whammy of inadequate resources and lax accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All Americans should be outraged at this and demand accountability. But we should also be outraged at the cynical agenda this administration has brought to all government functions. Resources are cut, making it impossible for the affected workforce to deliver high-quality services. At the same  time, critical functions are contracted out to the private sector without adequate oversight. Then the administration turns around and says, see, government doesn't  work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it's time we reversed course and put adequate resources, attention, and accountability towards the needs of all our citizens but most especially our veterans.</paragraph>
