    <paragraph>Madam President, today I recognize and congratulate Floridian Matthew Mariutto for his outstanding work and achievement in the study of history, and specifically, for his award-winning documentary on Apollo I.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, more than half a million students compete for recognition in the National History Day program. Students are given a general theme and the freedom to develop a presentation to present to the judges. This year's National History Day theme is "Triumph and Tragedy in History." This exercise develops and enhances a student's abilities for critical thinking and problem solving skills, research and reading skills, oral and written communication, self-esteem and self confidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Based on the quality and accuracy of their projects, this year, around 2,000 finalists were chosen. Of that group, 22 students were given the privilege of presenting their projects at the Smithsonian American Art Museum and National Portrait Gallery here in Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Matthew Mariutto has been selected to present his documentary on "Worth the Risk of Life: The Tragedy and Triumph of Apollo I." Matthew attends American Heritage School in Plantation, and his teacher is Leslie Porges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>History--and the teaching of its lessons--is an integral part of the education of future generations of Americans. I would like to commend the National History Day program for empowering teachers to bring history alive through innovative teaching methods and outside-of-the-classroom learning opportunities. I would also like to congratulate again, Matthew Mariutto, for his fine work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Matthew, you have earned the admiration of the Sunshine State. Additionally, your teachers and school deserve a great deal of appreciation for contributing to your education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations on a job well done.</paragraph>
