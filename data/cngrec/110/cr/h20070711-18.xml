    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the House will vote on the College Cost Reduction Act, which sounds good on the surface, but once you begin to peel back the layers of this onion, you find that it is just rotten to the core. It contains billions of dollars of new spending, and worse still, it will never even see the light of day. The President has vowed to veto the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it creates nine new entitlement government programs at a cost of $197 billion over 5 years. That's nine new programs. And this is just the tip of the iceberg with the leadership spending this year. $20 billion more than expected on the President's budget. They had $6 billion more in new spending on January's omnibus, $17 billion they added to troops spending. It goes on and on, and it is enough to make a taxpayer cry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And if there's one thing that we all know, once you've got a government program, you've got a government program. Ronald Reagan said it best. There is nothing so close to eternal life on Earth as a Federal Government program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The leadership knows this bill will not fly with the American people. I encourage my colleagues to vote "no."</paragraph>
