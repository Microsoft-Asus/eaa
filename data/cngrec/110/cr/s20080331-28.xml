    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor the life of a woman reverend across the State of Arkansas as a humble public servant. Will Etta "Willie" Oates, affectionately known as the "Hat Lady," passed away on March 4, 2008. She was loved for her active volunteerism and Arkansas pride.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although she was born in Kansas, she was an Arkansan through and through. Willie was born to Harry and Fern Long in Arkansas City, KS, on January 14, 1918. She graduated from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville where she was a cheerleader and met her life-long husband, Dr. Gordon Oates. It was at the university that she earned the nickname Willie.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After World War II, Willie began her career of volunteerism in Little Rock. She was selected as Little Rock Woman of the Year in 1955. In 1959, she became the first woman elected to the Arkansas Legislature in more than 30 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, it was her "hat skits" that captured people's attention. She traveled across Arkansas and more than 40 States speaking, performing her hat skits, judging various competitions, and serving as a grand marshall at many parades. In 1989, she was officially designated by proclamation of the State legislature as "Arkansas's Hat Lady."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During her lifetime, Willie belonged to over 50 national, State, and local organizations, served on over 25 boards, and was active in the First Presbyterian Church of Little Rock.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Willie Oates was my dear friend and an inspiration to all that knew her. I pay tribute to this public servant of Arkansas and express my greatest condolences to her family. She will be missed.</paragraph>
