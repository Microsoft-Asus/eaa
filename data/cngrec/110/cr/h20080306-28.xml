  <narrative>JOHNSON C. SMITH UNIVERSITY GOLDEN BULLS -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1400]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400424" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize and pay tribute to the Johnson C. Smith University Golden Bulls men's basketball team which won the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament held in my congressional district this past weekend. The Lady Golden Bulls, unfortunately, lost to Shaw University in the women's championship game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CIAA basketball tournament is, of course, the premier basketball tournament in the country among Historically Black Colleges and Universities, dating back years before African American athletes were admitted to and allowed to compete in athletics at other universities throughout the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the tournament highlights the tops in athletic competition and is a source of much needed funding for academic and athletic scholarships, anyone who has ever attended the tournament will know, of course, that it is also an unrivaled social reunion and family event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The outstanding athletic performances by Johnson C. Smith University's teams this weekend, especially the championship performance by the men's team, was one more tribute to Dr. Dorothy Yancey, who has announced that she will be retiring at the end of this school year after 14 years as president of Johnson C. Smith University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Yancey made history when she became the first female president of Johnson C. Smith University in 1994. Her leadership and hands-on management has led Johnson C. Smith University to many outstanding accomplishments, including two successful accreditation reviews, getting Johnson C. Smith University fully wired, and making it one of the first institutions in the Nation to provide laptop computers to every student; construction, renovation, or restoration of state-of-the-art facilities; and  recognition by the U.S. News and World Report magazine as a top tier institution among comprehensive colleges that offer bachelor's degrees for each of the last 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The recent success of Johnson C. Smith University's basketball teams, especially the CIAA's men's championship, is another tribute to Dr. Yancey's leadership as she prepares to retire from Johnson C. Smith. It couldn't have come at a more fitting time. Dr. Yancey's hard work and leadership will forever remain in the hearts of all Johnson C. Smith Golden Bulls and friends. We wish Dr. Yancey and Johnson C. Smith University continuing success. I am fortunate to be the representative of this fine  university in Congress.</paragraph>
