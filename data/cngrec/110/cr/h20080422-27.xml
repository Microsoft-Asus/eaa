    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="5613">H.R. 5613</bill>, the Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act of 2008. This is a bipartisan bill, critically important to our Nation's safety net. The Committee on Energy and Commerce reported it favorably with a strong bipartisan vote of 46-0.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend and thank our subcommittee chairman, Mr. Pallone, and our distinguished colleague and cosponsor of the legislation, Mr. Murphy of Pennsylvania, for their leadership on this matter. And I want to express to my good friends and the ranking members on the committee and the subcommittee, Mr. Barton and Mr. Deal, for their superb cooperation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank my colleagues on the Committees on Ways and Means and Financial Services for the splendid cooperation and help they gave us in moving this legislation to the floor expeditiously. The support of Chairmen Rangel and Stark were both necessary and very much appreciated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5613">H.R. 5613</bill> places a 1-year moratorium on seven regulations recently issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The regulations would have restricted payments to critical safety net providers such as hospitals and nursing homes, as well as payments for graduate medical education training. The regulation would have reduced or eliminated payments that allow children with severe mental illness to remain in family settings, and payments to schools transporting poor children with disabilities.  The Governors of all 50 States oppose these rules, as do the State Medicaid directors, State legislators, and the National Association of Counties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 2,000 national and local groups such as the American Hospital Association, the American Federation of Teachers and the March of Dimes support this legislation. They know of the devastating effect these rules would have upon local communities, upon the hospitals, and upon vulnerable beneficiaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without this moratorium, schools would be forced to lay off workers starting in June. Hospitals and nursing homes would be forced to cut off services and to lay off workers as well. In troublesome economic times, we cannot afford to lose good-paying jobs or to cut services that enable people with disabilities to be gainfully employed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5613">H.R. 5613</bill> will postpone the implementation of these seven rules for 1 year, giving Congress time to evaluate the effect they would have on States, providers and beneficiaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to again commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, including my dear friend, Mr. Barton, and Mr. Deal for their leadership and hard work on this matter. I urge my colleagues to vote for <bill type="h" number="5613">H.R. 5613</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Given the fact that Secretary Leavitt of Health and Human Services indicated that he would recommend to the President of the United States that he veto the bill before us in its current form, I do wish we could have brought the bill to the floor under a rule with several potential amendments and a motion to recommit so that we can have a little bit fuller debate rather than putting it on the suspension calendar. Having said that, I am very glad that it is coming to the floor as a stand-alone  bill, and that Chairman Dingell and Chairman PALLONE of the subcommittee have followed regular order in passing this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Dingell and Chairman PALLONE for holding a  legislative hearing as well as a subcommittee markup and a full committee markup on the bill that's now before us. I also want to thank them for having an open process, where staff on both sides of the aisle could work together, amendments could be shared, and some of those amendments could be agreed upon and incorporated into the bill that's before us today. I would  not have been able to support <bill type="h" number="5613">H.R. 5613</bill> as originally introduced, but I can support the bill that's before us this afternoon. I'm proud that, on occasion, we do put good public policy ahead of partisan politics, and the bill before us, again, is an example of what I believe to be better public policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do hope that we take this opportunity to take the issue before us, if this bill becomes law, and actually work on it for the year that the moratorium is in place. The bill before us would place a year-long moratorium on seven Medicaid rules. It does not mean that the suspended rules themselves are all bad and don't address a problem that needs to be addressed. It does mean that many of the interest groups and many of the States had significant problems with those rules, and so it was felt prudent  to have a moratorium where we could hopefully, in the interim, determine how to fine tune and maybe change some of those rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do need to save money in Medicaid. We do need to do something on this system of intergovernmental transfers. For those of you who don't understand what an intergovernmental transfer is, as used in Medicaid, a State will give money to the Federal Government that is then matched by the Federal Government and sent back to the State. The State will give some of that money to, in this case a hospital system, but then keep some of the money that it initially gave. So it's kind of a shell game where  you put up some money to get it matched, and once you get the matched back, the money you put up you use for another purpose, not for a health purpose, but maybe for a different purpose, like building a highway or something like that. One of the suspended rules would have addressed this intergovernmental transfer, and I hope that in the next year, on a bipartisan basis, we can address the intergovernmental transfer issue itself.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We simply cannot pretend on a day that we're suspending these rules that there are not fundamental financial difficulties facing Medicaid. So while we agree to suspend the rules for the next year, I hope we can also agree, as the chairman just indicated that he did, that we're going to continue to work on the problems these rules were designed to address so that over time we can reach agreement on how to save money under Medicaid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do believe the bill before us is a good bill. It does have a pay-for. It is, on a net basis, a slight revenue increase to the Federal Treasury, so it is paid for. And if we spend the next year working together, if we implement some of the things in this bill, the bill gives $25 million a year to combat waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid, if we use that money wisely, we will uncover some savings. And if we look at some of these suspended rules, we can perhaps work together to fine tune them  so that a year from now, at the beginning of the next administration, we don't have to extend the moratorium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, Mr. Speaker, while this is not a perfect bill, it's a good bill. Don't let the pursuit of perfection prevent the accomplishment of what is something that is good and possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge a "yes" vote on <bill type="h" number="5613">H.R. 5613</bill>, especially on my side of the aisle, among the Republicans in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Dingell-Murphy bill, <bill type="h" number="5613">H.R. 5613</bill>, which would delay seven Medicaid regulations that would shift billions of dollars in costs from the Federal Government to States, counties, school districts, hospitals, and other medical providers. There is absolutely no justification for such a cost shift, especially at a time when many States are struggling to avoid budget cuts as their economies slow and revenues decline. The bill would delay the implementation  of these regulations until April 1, 2009.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Oversight Committee held hearings on this matter. We heard testimony from public and teaching hospital administrators, an emergency room physician, a child welfare worker and a school nurse. They explained how the regulations would shift costs to States and localities and what that cost would mean for access to services for beneficiaries. We also heard from a representative from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which issued these regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And since Medicaid is a Federal-State program, one would think that when the Federal Government changes the rules, as these regulations would do, it would first try to determine what the impact of these changes would be on the different States. Well, we followed up with the head of the CMS for Medicaid, and he told us that he had not done a State-by-State specific analysis of the impact and he had no plans to do such an analysis. So our committee made our own analysis. We did a survey of Medicaid  directors for 43 States and the District of Columbia, and they told us that if CMS were allowed to implement all seven Medicaid regulations, their States would lose nearly $50 billion in Federal funds over the next 5 years. The result of these cost shifts would not be greater efficiency, it would not be a savings of money, it would simply come out of the reimbursements, and fewer eligible populations. They</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, the best professional judgment was that the regulations would have harmful fiscal and programmatic consequences for their States and the people that look to the Medicaid program as the safety net for health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The bill before us gives the department and the Congress the time to look into these issues in the detail they deserve without making fundamental changes in Federal Medicaid policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge support for this bipartisan legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's an honor to serve under Chairman Dingell on the Energy and Commerce Committee and to support this effort to keep the Medicaid safety net intact. That our chairman shepherded this must-pass bill through our committee with unanimous support is testament to his enormous legislative skill and bipartisanship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unless we pass this bill, Mr. Speaker, public hospitals and the essential services they provide will be at grave risk. A major public hospital in my district, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, is among them. It is the only level 1 trauma center near top terror targets like LAX and the ports of Long Beach and L.A. In the event of an attack, Harbor would be on the front lines. As a teaching hospital, it helps train the next generation of doctors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if all seven Medicaid regulations are implemented, Los Angeles County will lose $240 million in annual funding, the equivalent of closing a public hospital like Harbor. Harbor is already overcrowded. It needs more help, not less. It needs to offer more services, not to close. <bill type="h" number="5613">H.R. 5613</bill> will stop these catastrophic cuts, and it deserves our full support.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5613">H.R. 5613</bill>, the Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act of 2008. After unsuccessful attempts at S-CHIP over the last several months, over 33,000 children in my district are still uninsured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the most vulnerable of beneficiaries of Medicaid, children and the disabled, are faced with a major crisis. This bill has bipartisan support, this is not about politics. It's about helping hardworking families and the poorest among us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill includes a moratorium of 7 CMS regulations, preventing the stripping of over $20 billion in Federal Medicaid funding over the next 5 years to States for vital programs and services. These programs and services will only shrink and shrivel if they are put against the wall to eat up these costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even school districts, like Rialto Unified School District from my district, will face difficult challenges in providing direct health services to the 30,000 students it currently serves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cutting these valuable services at a time when many States, including California are facing record budget deficits is not an option. The poorest amongst us on Medicaid are most affected. We cannot turn our backs during these troubling times of increasing foreclosures and rising gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cancer does not distinguish between incomes, why should health care coverage?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong support for <bill type="h" number="5613">H.R. 5613</bill>, the "Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act of 2008." This bill stops George Bush's draconian attempt to gut the Medicaid program, which provides medical care to millions of low-income children and families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we fail to enact this bill, more than $20 billion in vital Federal funding for States will disappear. This is $20 billion that helps schools provide transportation for physically disabled children, allows local governments to contribute to the State Medicaid share, and trains physicians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This President has presided over the greatest transition from boom to bust since the 1920s. As families face foreclosure and rising food and gas costs, States see declining sales tax receipts and greater numbers in need of assistance. Our President would add insult to injury for working families by dismantling their safety net.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The seven regulations proposed by the Bush administration would undermine longstanding practices upon which States have built their Medicaid programs. The regulations are opposed by a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers; all the Nation's Governors from both sides of the aisle; and a host of public health, physician, and patient advocates. The bill passed unanimously out of the Energy and Commerce Committee. In this day and age, that is a remarkable phenomenon. I am proud to join colleagues from  both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of this moratorium and to protect the health care safety net for America's working families.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400661" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I join a bipartisan House to stand up to the Bush administration to prevent it from irresponsibly slashing the Medicaid budget. States that work with the Federal government to run and fund Medicaid programs are already facing budgetary restraints, flat funding, and shortfalls. The administration's proposed cuts to Medicaid would exacerbate their budgetary crunch, and would directly affect the quality of care given to low-income kids, seniors, families  and people living with disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today, <bill type="h" number="5613">H.R. 5613</bill>, would place a 1-year moratorium on seven Medicaid regulations proposed by the administration. This 1-year moratorium would give Congress more time to evaluate the potential effects of his proposed cuts on State Medicaid programs and the individuals that they serve. Several groups have warned that the unexpected slashes in Federal Medicaid dollars could force States to shift their Medicaid costs to patients, who would be hard pressed to make up the differences  in health care costs. At present, some 30 million low-income children depend on the Medicaid program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Government Accountability Office testified that it had not recommended the specific changes proposed by the administration, nor had officials there had time to adequately study the potential effects of these changes for 6 of the 7 regulations. Before the President starts tinkering with domestic programs upon which millions of our most vulnerable citizens rely, he owes it to them to do his homework. If he won't, then Congress owes it to the American people to investigate his proposed changes  so we can fully understand their effect on poor and working families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 2,000 groups from across the country, including school districts, hospitals, case management providers, and organizations serving people with disabilities and mental illnesses have joined us in support of the Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill and urge my colleagues to cast their votes in favor of it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="5613">H.R. 5613</bill> the Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act, and urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, my colleagues and I on the Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously approved <bill type="h" number="5613">H.R. 5613</bill>, the Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act. This bill places moratoria on seven regulations issued by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS. If allowed to go into effect as currently written, these regulations would seriously erode federal funding to the states for a range of Medicaid services, including rehabilitation and medical services for schoolchildren with disabilities, and  would totally eliminate federal Medicaid matching funds for Graduate Medical Education at a time when my state is already in the grip of a growing physician shortage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly concerned about the detrimental effect that these regulations would have on students and schools in my district and districts across the country. Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, schools are required to provide medical and rehabilitation services that are necessary for children to enter and continue to attend school. If federal matching funds are reduced or eliminated, our schools will still be required pay for these services, meaning other vital services  and programs would have to be significantly cut back or eliminated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another major concern of mine is the extent to which these regulations would reduce or eliminate federal matching payments for many of our community hospitals, seriously undermining access to care for poor and disabled women, children, and persons with disabilities. Our hospitals are already struggling under low Medicaid reimbursement rates and higher rates of uncompensated care as my State's economy has worsened. Like schools, hospitals are under a federal mandate--this one to examine and stabilize  every patient who walks through their emergency room doors. These regulations could significantly increase hospitals' burden of uncompensated care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also concerned about provisions in several of the regulations that could well undo the progress we have made over many years in enabling persons with mental and physical  disabilities to live independently and participate as fully as they are able in the workforce and the life of their communities rather than being confined to institutional settings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of all these factors, I again encourage my colleagues to join me in voting for this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400160" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5613">H.R. 5613</bill>, the Protecting Medicaid Safety Net Act. The rules issued by CMS in August were said to be cost saving measures and a way to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If these 7 regulations go into effect Texas would lose $3.4 billion in Federal Medicaid funding over the next 5 years and nationwide cuts to Medicaid funding could total around $50 billion. These regulations attack the core mission of Medicaid by eliminating much needed services for children, the elderly, and the poor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These cuts will also have a devastating impact on state's Medicaid funds; consequently hurting the most vulnerable populations who are helped by the Medicaid safety net. This population accesses services and support care from Medicaid because they cannot access services elsewhere due to costs or restrictions on benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If these regulations go into effect, I don't know where the states will find the funds to continue operating programs such as school administrative and transportation services, coverage for rehabilitative services, and outpatient hospital services. Especially since the lack of Medicaid funding will create budget crises in most states as they scramble to pay for services or eliminate them altogether.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill gives Congress enough time to understand the consequences of these regulations and come up with a solution we all can agree on rather than cutting these necessary services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am disappointed that the Administration has threatened to veto this bill. This piece of legislation is the result of a lot of hard work on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly upset that the Administration seems to have forgotten once again about its Texas roots. Texas, along with California and New York stand to lose the largest amount of funding from these Medicaid cuts and this is money our states cannot afford to lose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has the support of 2,000 organizations and the National Governors Association. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and stop these cuts.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400162" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, over the past year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, have introduced a series of Medicaid regulations that have caused grave concern to our States and beneficiaries. States are struggling as the economy sinks into recession, and these proposed regulations, if not suspended, will add billions in Medicaid costs to our States at a time when their tax revenues are falling and Medicaid caseloads are growing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The seven regulations issued by CMS erode the foundation of the Medicaid system by preventing beneficiaries from accessing the care they need. These proposed regulations would endanger access to care by severely limiting payments to public hospitals, eliminate coverage for outpatient services that keep beneficiaries from unnecessary emergency room use, and by restricting support for transportation services for children with disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman DINGELL for his superb leadership on this issue and for introducing and garnering bipartisan support for this unfortunate but very necessary moratorium. This important legislation will help protect beneficiaries from harmful cuts and alleviate the immediate concerns that the Medicaid regulations cause for long term care patients, residents and providers alike. The bill also establishes an independent review of these regulations prior  to the expiration of the moratorium next year. In addition, it provides $25 million to HHS each year, beginning in FY 2009, to fight fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This moratorium is a temporary fix, allowing Congress an opportunity to review these regulations as thoroughly as possible before they are implemented and the burden is borne by our constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While CMS argues that these changes will create efficiencies in the program, there is no evidence to support this claim. What is known is that these changes will cause extreme harm to our most vulnerable citizens--low-income children, the disabled, and the elderly. By utterly disregarding the immense public outcry surrounding the enactment of these rules, this administration is placing desperately needed services in jeopardy without thoroughly weighing the effects these regulations will have  on States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now more than ever, in the face of major State budget deficits, we cannot allow the Federal Government to make major regulatory changes to Medicaid that will result in billions of additional costs to states.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a proud, original cosponsor of Chairman DINGELL's <bill type="h" number="5613">H.R. 5613</bill>, the Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act of 2008 and urge all my colleagues in this 110th Congress to stand with me and stop this Administration from implementing these foolish and potentially devastating regulations.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400415" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its inception, Medicaid has been a joint State and Federal partnership to provide health care to the country's neediest and most vulnerable populations. Unfortunately, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, recently issued a series of Medicaid regulations that will significantly shift costs to States and restrict services to needy individuals. These regulations will force States to stop providing beneficiaries access to certain Medicaid services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the damaging Medicaid regulations issued by CMS, I am especially concerned about the restrictive rules on targeted case management services that help people with disabilities remain in their community. Nearly 200,000 people in Maryland receive some type of Medicaid case management services, and these new rules will put more than $60 million in Federal funds for Maryland at risk. CMS also proposes to eliminate or severely restrict Federal Medicaid funding for rehabilitation services, graduate  medical education, hospital outpatient services, safety net institutions, and school-based transportation and outreach programs. While CMS claims that the elimination of $20 billion in Federal Medicaid funding will create efficiencies in the program, it did not consult with Congress on these far reaching regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With so many States, including Maryland, facing huge budget shortfalls and trying to figure out how to provide Medicaid services to their populations, now is not the time for the Federal Government to cut back on its share of funding. The legislation before us today would delay implementation of the regulations put forth by CMS so that Congress can examine their full impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have a responsibility and an obligation to our vulnerable citizens--low-income children, the disabled, and the elderly--to effectively provide access to adequate and quality health care services. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of <bill type="h" number="5613">H.R. 5613</bill>--the Medicaid Safety Net Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The millions of people who depend on this critical safety net and I thank and applaud Chairman Dingell for once again protecting our Nation's critically important Medicaid program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a shame that every year Democrats have to fight back at least one attempt to cut funding and provisions in this program that is so vital to the Nation's poor--the majority of which are people of color.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration and the Secretary's policies are going in the absolute wrong direction. Rather Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance funding needs to be increased to meet the needs of the increasing numbers of un- and under-insured which includes 9 million children. This administration's failed economic policies have left more people vulnerable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Racial and ethnic minorities suffer worse morbidity and mortality because of lack of access. Caps on Medicaid in the territories don't even allow us to cover residents at 100 percent of poverty and per capita spending is a shamefully small fraction of that of our fellow Americans in the States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Nation's healthcare system as we all know has become a sick-care system and not only is it not doing a good job at that, it is in crisis and on the verge of catastrophe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposed actions restricting payments for graduate medical education and blanket regulations against payment for certain services, threaten to not only make the healthcare situation in this country worse for the poor, but for everyone, and to threaten the competitiveness and security of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to the new Democratic administration, who will work with Chairman Dingell and others to transform health care in this country and reduce the skyrocketing costs through emphasis on prevention and equal access to quality, comprehensive culturally competent care for everyone who lives here. The foundation of this effort must be stronger Medicaid and SCHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By stopping the assault on these two programs; by stopping payments to hard working providers and for the training of the healthcare workforce needed, we set the stage for that transformation to begin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you Mr. Chairman, for your continued leadership.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong support for the passage of <bill type="h" number="5613">H.R. 5613</bill>, the Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act. I commend my colleagues Representative DINGELL and Representative MURPHY for introducing this bill, which would extend until March 31, 2009 the moratorium on several Medicaid regulations that would strip an estimated $20 billion over 5 years from the Medicaid program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for more than 40 years, Medicaid has served as the Nation's health care safety net, providing access to health services for millions who cannot afford private insurance in a dynamic and changing economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, more than 57 million children, poor, disabled and elderly individuals rely on Medicaid for care. The program now serves more people than Medicare, and with the ranks of the uninsured growing, and the threat of an economic recession, the Medicaid program is more important than ever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, hospitals are the backbone of America's health care safety net, providing care to all patients who come through their doors, regardless of their ability to pay. But, hospitals are experiencing severe payment shortfalls when treating Medicaid patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these financial pressures, the Administration continues to call for further cuts in federal funds for the Medicaid program that will affect hospitals and the patients they serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite concerns raised by Congress, CMS continues to take steps to implement these regulations. These rules range from limiting payments for teaching hospitals, public hospitals and hospital outpatient services to reducing school-based services for children and case management for the disabled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, Congress imposed a year-long moratorium (P.L. 110-28) on two regulations the proposed and final cost-limit rule and the proposed graduate medical education (GME) rule. The moratorium on implementation of these rules expires May 25, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CMS's regulatory budget-cutting policies will have a devastating effect on my home State of New Jersey's Medicaid program, along with the hospitals and physicians serving our Nation's most vulnerable population--poor children and mothers, the disabled and elderly individuals. Much of Congress has expressed opposition to these rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would delay implementation of regulations affecting: CPEs; IGTs; GME; coverage of rehab services for people with disabilities; outreach and enrollment in schools, in addition to specialized medical transportation to school for children covered by Medicaid; coverage of hospital outpatient services; case management services that allow people with disabilities to remain in the community; and state provider tax laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is no question that CMS's regulatory budget-cutting policies will have a devastating effect on my home State of New Jersey's Medicaid program, along with the hospitals and physicians serving our Nation's most vulnerable population--poor children and mothers, the disabled and elderly individuals.</paragraph>
