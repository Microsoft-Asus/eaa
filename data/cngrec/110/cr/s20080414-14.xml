    <paragraph>Madam President, as we approach the anniversary of the Virginia Tech tragedy, I am introducing legislation to implement one of the key recommendations from the Virginia Tech Review Panel that was formed by Gov. Tim Kaine to examine some of the issues that arose following the shooting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is exactly 1 year this week when a disturbed young man took the lives of 32 students and faculty and wounded several others on the campus of Virginia Tech. I commend the Virginia Tech community for pulling through such a difficult time and for the tremendous amount of courage they displayed. I also wish to extend my continuing sympathy to the families of the students and faculty who were directly impacted by these shootings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 19, 2007, 3 days after the Virginia Tech shooting, Governor Kaine announced the formation of the Virginia Tech Review Panel to perform a review of the events of April 16. This panel included individuals with the expertise and autonomy necessary to conduct a comprehensive review. These nationally recognized individuals brought expertise in many areas, including law enforcement, security, governmental management, mental health, emergency care, victims' services, the Virginia court system,  and higher education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The genesis for the legislation I am introducing is the report prepared by this panel and released to the public in August 2007. A similar report was prepared for President Bush by the Attorney General and the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Education in follow-up to meetings with  various experts across the country. Both reports documented serious concerns from individuals in various communities throughout Virginia and the Nation regarding  the treatment of student medical records.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One main theme that kept resonating in various communities was concern with the appropriate balance between providing for the safety of our communities while at the same time protecting privacy rights. Too many college administrators are unsure how to balance the right to privacy against public safety, and Federal law and regulations are of little help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill simply attempts to clear up any ambiguity that currently exists within the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, known as FERPA, which allows for the sharing of student educational records in order to protect the health or safety of a student or the general public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>FERPA, written in 1974, was created at a time when schools did not provide the health care services they do today. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, half of all lifetime cases of mental illness begin by age 14. Schools today, whether they are K-12 or a post-secondary institution, have critical student health records in their hands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important for Congress to ensure that we provide our school officials, administrators, and counselors clear Federal guidelines to protect the privacy and to ensure the safety of our students. My bill attempts to address the concerns raised by school officials, administrators, and institutions in interpreting FERPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If one looks back at the recommendations of the Virginia Tech Review Panel, one notices that a key resounding issue is the misinterpretation of Federal and State privacy laws. My bill does three things to amend FERPA so that tragic situations such as the one at Virginia Tech are less likely to occur. First, it adds an explicit "safe harbor" provision to make clear that no violation of FERPA occurs if a school official discloses information in a good-faith belief that it is necessary to protect  the health or safety of a student or the general public. Second, it clarifies how FERPA applies to student treatment records held for treatment purposes. Third, it clarifies the emergency exception in FERPA to emphasize that in an emergency, information-sharing is allowed if done in a good-faith belief that doing so will protect against a possible threat to the health or safety of a student or the general public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a straightforward attempt to address several recommendations that were made by the Virginia Tech Review Panel in clarifying the widespread perception that information privacy laws make it difficult to respond effectively to troubled students. It is important for school officials to use their best professional judgment in deciding when to disclose or not to disclose information without fear of violating Federal educational privacy laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is widespread agreement that existing law is in need of clarification. In this regard, I note that the Department of Education proposed a rule on March 24 of this year, which is an attempt to clarify and give guidance to university administration on what they can and cannot do in handling treatment records. I believe this bill is a more direct and effective way to achieve that desired clarity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together with the passage of the Mental Health Parity Act in both the House and Senate and other measures to ensure access to mental health services, my bill will be a good step in addressing this growing issue of mental disorders that is all too common in many communities. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate for quick passage of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Amendments of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I yield the floor, I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
