  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, I am pleased to recognize a man whose work has touched so many people in Africa and beyond, and whose life has demonstrated the power of transformation. Tomorrow, former South African President Nelson Mandela will celebrate his 90th birthday and I would like to send him my very best wishes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have traveled across Africa, I have witnessed the respect Mandela commands and the pride he evokes in all Africans, across borders and boundaries. It is nearly unmatched. He is a symbol of the enduring truth that even the most intractable systems of repression and violence can be overcome with courage and persistence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The lessons of Mandela's leadership are made that much more remarkable when juxtaposed with another African liberation leader, Robert Mugabe. Upon being released from jail after 27 years, Mandela chose to pursue a path of reconciliation rather than retaliation. When he became President in 1994, he continued that approach and worked to unite the country around his vision of a "rainbow nation." After one term, he stepped aside as President, realizing that institutions must take precedence over  individuals in building a stable democracy. Though South Africa certainly had its share of problems since--including a skyrocketing rate of HIV, increasing political turmoil and a recent wave of xenophobic attacks against immigrants--Mandela continues to be a voice for peace and stability, a voice of and for all people of South Africa. The contrast with the continued bloodshed and repression in neighboring, Zimbabwe is stark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Mandela's vision for South Africa not only sought peace within its borders, but also beyond them. In 1993, he famously said that human rights would be "the light that guides our foreign affairs." After leaving office, Mandela continued to embody that vision in South Africa and across the continent as he focused on building support for this critical principle--whether with civil society groups or government officials. He has been actively involved in peace processes around the world  and a leading advocate for global action to address HIV/AIDS. His willingness to speak out against injustice wherever it festers has inspired and challenged all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am gravely concerned that the current South African leadership is moving away from this vision. Its unwillingness to publicly criticize recent abuses in Zimbabwe or allow for an expanded mediation is undermining pressure on the Mugabe regime to accept a transitional government. In addition, the announcement by the South African Government that it will oppose the International Criminal Court's indictment of Sudanese President Al-Bashir is deeply disappointing. I have deep respect for the leadership  South Africa demonstrates on the continent and that is precisely why I challenge its leaders to play a more active and constructive role in efforts to promote peace, security, and democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mandela's legacy challenges not only South Africa, but all of us who care about the future of Africa. There is a tendency to look for easy answers or quick fixes to the challenges facing the continent today. Mandela's life is testament to the reality that sustainable peace and democracy require continued investment and long-term vision. They  are not static and cannot be taken for granted. As we celebrate his 90th birthday tomorrow, I hope we will take  seriously that challenge and commit ourselves to the hard work of standing up for freedom and justice. For the people of Sudan, Zimbabwe and so many other parts of the world, the stakes have never been higher.</paragraph>
