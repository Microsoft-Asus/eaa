    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday a bill was introduced into the House of Representatives that gives  the promise of transforming our country and the world. <bill type="h" number="808">H.R. 808</bill> creates a Department of Peace and Nonviolence. It is now supported by 52 Members of the House of Representatives, and it is supported by groups who yesterday came to Washington representing 45 States. Last night, nearly 1,000 people came to the George Washington University campus to hear  about the Department of Peace and the hope that it brings for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if you were to look at this clerk's desk, just around the corner you will see engraved right into the desk of the clerk of the House of Representatives the word "peace." Peace is a foundational principle of this Congress and of this country, and the bill gives it a chance to have an animating power in our civic life by addressing the issues of domestic violence, spousal abuse, child abuse, violence in the schools, racial violence, all of those concerns we have both domestically  and internationally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peace.</paragraph>
