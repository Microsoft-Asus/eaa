  <speaking speaker="400644" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it's high time Congress acts on high gas prices. The American people are crying out for help and assistance; yet this Democrat Congress is doing nothing when it comes to energy independence for Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finding a comprehensive long-term solution is what the American people want so that we can be energy independent, or at least more energy independent than we are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Conserving is a sign of personal virtue, but we cannot conserve our way to American energy independence. The Democrat plan is only conservation and it's only tax increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On our side of the aisle, we are trying to reach out to the Democrats and say that we must have energy exploration here domestically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it comes to energy, America needs to rely on its own ingenuity and innovation, not the Saudi royal family.</paragraph>
