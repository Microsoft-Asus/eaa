    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Hawaii?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="2515">H.R. 2515</bill>, as introduced by our colleague and friend, Representative Dean Heller, would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to participate in the multi-species habitat conservation plan on the lower 400 miles of the Colorado River. The States of Nevada, Arizona and California, along with several major water districts, are participants and funding partners in this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As amended, this legislation is not controversial and should be supported. And I might say, Madam Speaker, exhibits the multiple responsibilities of the Resources Committee and the really extraordinary complications and details that have to be considered when such legislation comes forward. It is a tribute to the staffs of the members on the committee, and most particularly the professional staff of the Resources Committee, that this legislation is able to be compiled, understood and comprehended  by the members, and then brought forward to the body as a whole in a way that advances the public interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This particular bill helps solve the conundrum that we face in the protection and conservation of certain species: For example, the bony-tailed chub, the razorback sucker, and the humpback chub.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2515">H.R. 2515</bill>, introduced by Dean Heller of Nevada and Harry Mitchell of Arizona, is an amended bipartisan measure aimed at protecting endangered species while keeping the waters running and the lights on for consumers in the Southwest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As amended at the committee level, this bill has been scaled back, but still codifies a very popular multi-species habitat conservation plan on the Lower Colorado River. I note that some water and power supply organizations support key provisions taken out by the majority. However, in the interest of moving this bill forward, they support the passage of this bill with the hope that the final bill signed into law will better resemble the original legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when our water supply is being diminished due to a number of factors, this bill--although somewhat incomplete--is still a win-win for our water and power consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have no additional speakers, and I am prepared to yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400001" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I observed that Mr. Bishop was looking directly at me when he recited, with a look that I can only determine as "gleeful," he cited the razorback sucker and the bonytail chub. I am not sure whether I was being categorized by him in the sucker category or the chub category, or he was gazing at me metaphorically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do you suppose he might be able to answer that for me.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400001" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will yield.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. BISHOP of UTAH. I have certainly never thought of the gentleman as either a razorback or a bonytail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is now clear for me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="2515">H.R. 2515</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
