    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the 125th anniversary of the founding of the city of Epiphany, SD. After 125 years, this progressive community will have a chance to reflect on its past and future, and I congratulate the people of Epiphany for all that they have accomplished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dating back to the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the establishment of the Dakota Territory in 1861, and the Homestead Act of 1862, Epiphany is located in Hanson County in northeast South Dakota. The town witnessed an influx of residents after the arrival of Father William Kroeger in 1893, who was known for his medical studies and work to build the Church of Epiphany. This grand, historic landmark continues to be a beautiful and inspirational symbol of pride to the community and its residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Epiphany originally featured several local businesses, including the J.P. Zeihen General Store, a blacksmith, saloon, barbershop, and cream station. Today, the town claims the Coonhunter Inn, the Village Hair Design, J &amp; H Construction, and Denis &amp; Evie Wingen's Appliance Shop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Epiphany commemorated its anniversary with a celebration on the weekend of August 1-3. Even 125 years after its founding, Epiphany continues to be a vibrant community. I am proud to honor the accomplishments of the people of Epiphany, and congratulate them on this impressive achievement.</paragraph>
