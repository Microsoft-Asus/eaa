    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as the House prepares to vote on the Child Health and Medicare Protection Act, known as the CHAMP Act, later today, I think it is important to refute some of the misleading talking points that Republicans are seizing on as they oppose this health insurance for millions of American children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, Republicans claim that by strengthening the State Children's Health Insurance Program, known as SCHIP, we are advancing "government doctors," advancing "government health plans."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This could be no further from the truth. Government does not deliver SCHIP services. Instead, it is private doctors and private health plans through private insurance. This program is operated successfully in my State of New Jersey and around the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, Republicans say that we are trying to expand the program to reach middle-income families. Again, that is false. We are not expanding the program. Today, 5 million children are eligible for SCHIP but are not enrolled. We are strengthening the program so that we can reach almost all of these children, the vast majority of whom come from low-income families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this bill.</paragraph>
