    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill>) to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize States to restrict receipt of foreign municipal solid waste and implement the Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste between the United States and Canada, and for other purposes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill>, the International Solid Waste Importation and Management Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is a culmination of efforts that began with the introduction of the international waste bill in the 104th Congress and has been introduced by our committee chairman, Mr. Dingell; and sponsored by all the members of the Michigan delegation, including Mr. Rogers, Mr. Stupak, Mr. Upton, Mr. Ehlers, Mr. McCotter, Mr. Levin, Mr. Conyers, Mr. Kildee, Mrs. Miller, Ms. Kilpatrick, Mr. Camp,  Mr. Knollenberg, Mr. Hoekstra, and Mr. Walberg. I want to thank and congratulate all these Members for their tireless efforts to move this legislation to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In March this legislation was reported out of the subcommittee which I chair, the Subcommittee on the Environment and Hazardous Materials, and out of the full Committee on Energy and Commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This legislation, which has a long history of bipartisan support, is long overdue in providing States and localities control over the amount of international municipal solid waste that they are forced to accept.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The extent of this problem is exemplified by the millions of tons of solid waste that is trucked into this country at the rate of approximately 350 truckloads per day. The volume of the international solid waste that comes into this country on a daily basis places an undue burden on the States' and localities' landfill capacities, as well as their roads and infrastructure, solely at the expense of the States and localities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation seeks to address these concerns by providing the States with the authority to place limits on the amounts of international municipal solid waste that they will accept. It will give the States and the EPA clear authority to safely manage solid waste disposal and to control waste volumes in the best interests of the States and the Nation as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> provides the necessary legal authority for the United States, through the Environmental Protection Agency, to fully implement the 1986 Trans-Boundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and Other Wastes Agreement between the United States and Canada. These are simple steps that will provide the legislative authority to the Federal and State governments, and are also consistent with the powers enumerated in the United States Constitution and our international trade obligations and  agreement. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this very important and bipartisan bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400342" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first want to thank JOHN DINGELL, a friend and colleague and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, for working with us on putting together what I think is a great product, and really the first opportunity we are going to have in Michigan, I think the first really good opportunity to say "no" to Canadian trash. And for that, sir, I thank you. And Mr. Wynn, sir, thank you as well for working with us and standing tall, which is really an important issue. Michigan gets  hit hardest, and your care and concern for those of us in the north is greatly appreciated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, the current law allows trash to move across international borders and States can do nothing to regulate this waste, as Congress has not given them the authority to do so. Canada has for years taken advantage of this situation by turning Michigan into the dumping ground for Ontario's trash. This bill, the fourth of its kind, really, since 2000, gives States the authority to regulate Canadian waste and directs the EPA to implement the existing U.S.-Canada Trans-Boundary Agreement. More  importantly, it gives Michigan the authority to regulate trash coming from Ontario, no matter how the EPA chooses to implement that trans-boundary agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006 alone, over 3.6 million tons of Canadian trash was dumped in our great State of Michigan. As we lose landfill space, shipments of Canadian waste continue to increase every year, and this year was no exception, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While my colleagues and I have been trying to pass this law, the problem has only gotten worse. Since 2001, when I introduced the first bill to fight Canadian trash, over 17 million tons of garbage have been driven across the border and dumped into our back yards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since our first attempts to fix this problem, annual garbage loads from Canada have tripled. Of all the trash Canada sends to the United States, 90 percent of it ends up in Michigan. Six years ago, just 10 percent of the waste disposed in Michigan landfills came from Canada; today, that has doubled to 20 percent. Over 400 garbage trucks over a single day rumble through our neighborhoods and deposit and unload their waste in Michigan landfills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without the ability to regulate this out-of-control surge in Canadian waste, Michigan communities can only sit back and watch the trash pile up. And what have we been getting and why is this a concern? We have had human blood dripping from trash trucks; stopped the whole bridge crossing for almost 6 hours on one occasion as the local police tried to determine the cause of it. It turned out it was hazardous medical waste. Thank God it wasn't a body. But we didn't know, and there is no good way  to search those trucks to find out. We had to find out because human blood was dripping from the back of a garbage truck.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have found drugs in those garbage trucks. We have found, in the dumps that receive Canadian trash, that PCP levels have increased. It is a true and real environmental and security problem, not just for Michigan, but for the United States, that we don't get a handle and say to our good friends to the north, this is an unneighborly thing to do, let's work this out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we anticipated years ago in Michigan that we would cite landfills, which is a very difficult thing to do, we had 20 years' worth of capacity; pretty hard thing to do. You go in through neighborhoods, and we cited these landfills. And we did the right thing for the right environmental reasons. And because of Canada, we believe that our  landfill capacity, because we were diligent and were trying to protect our environment in the future, may have been  cut in half because of Canada's inability to deal with their own household municipal garbage problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The best part of this is that in Canada they actually allow its provinces to restrict intraprovince waste. So if you think about this, Saskatchewan could say "no" to Ontario's trash, while Michigan is compelled by law to take it. That is a problem. And again, I argue, it is unneighborly, and we should be able to fix this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that this bill would not impact State shipments of trash, commercial waste streams; it is only that household municipal waste, that trash that is at the end of the revenue stream where you dig a big hole and you throw it in, that is the only trash that this bill narrowly focused on. 518 is a balanced, narrow NAFTA-compliant bill that gives Michigan and other States the authority they need to be good stewards of their land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen, and Madam Speaker, Michigan needs your help. My colleagues and I urge the support of this important bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I again want to thank Chairman Dingell and Chairman WYNN for their help and assistance in what really is not only an environmental issue, but a national security issue as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill>, the International Solid Waste Management Act of 2007. This legislation is of the greatest importance to our people in Michigan, and it has been sponsored with great enthusiasm by all members of the Michigan delegation in a completely bipartisan fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Rogers, Mr. Stupak, Mr. Upton, Mr. Ehlers, Mr. McCotter, Mr. Levin, Mr. Conyers, Mr. Kildee, Mrs. Miller, Ms. Kilpatrick, Mr. Camp, Mr. Knollenberg, Mr. Hoekstra and Mr. Walberg have all been important supporters of this bill. And I want to pay particular tribute to my colleague from Michigan (Mr. Rogers) for his leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee on Environment and Hazardous Materials for his leadership and for his help and for the way that he has taken care of us in Michigan in making it possible for this legislation to be on the floor at this particular time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from Maryland is an extremely effective and able leader, and we are not only grateful to him, but also to our dear friend, Mr. Gillmor, who moved it for us in the last Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation is identical to the bill that passed the House of Representatives without opposition last September. In this Congress it was reported out both by the Subcommittee on Environment and Hazardous Materials and the full Committee on Energy and Commerce by voice vote, without dissent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would point out that it requires the EPA to enforce the notice-and-consent provisions in the bilateral U.S.-Canadian agreement, an agreement which was signed by the United States and Canada in 1986 to govern trans-boundary movement of hazardous waste, and amended in 1992 to include municipal solid waste.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note now that the administration should comply with the notice-and-consent provisions which require both parties to use best efforts, absent regulation. Unfortunately, the needed efforts by the Administration have not been forthcoming. Although legislation was promised to be delivered "soon", by the Administration it has yet to appear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michigan's ability to manage the importation of solid waste is crucial to the comprehensive and environmentally sound waste management that the State of Michigan wants to have. Since 1996 when Michigan first began collecting the data, we have seen a 350 percent rise in the amount of Canadian waste disposed in Michigan, going from 2.7 million cubic yards to 12.1 cubic yards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As mentioned by Mr. Rogers, better than 400 trucks haul this waste across the bridges every day from Canada into Michigan. Not only is this waste an obnoxious substance, but it is a hazard to travelers and to our roads. It is also an environmental risk, a security risk, and a hazard to the health and security and safety of our people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would ensure that the U.S.-Canadian Agreement is properly implemented and properly enforced. The bill provides criteria to ensure that the views of State and local governments are properly taken into account in implementing the bilateral agreement and the bill adds the necessary enforcement authority so that this can be dealt with fully, completely, and properly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation would also give not just Michigan, but all of the States, more authority to regulate foreign waste until the Environmental Protection Agency's rules and regulations go into effect. This is extremely important, as all of my colleagues in Michigan and elsewhere know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say that I am pleased that the House is moving forward. I commend my colleagues in the Michigan delegation for the extraordinary cooperation, leadership and energy with which they have addressed this problem. And I want to again thank and express my deep gratitude to the Chairman of the Subcommittee, my good friend from Maryland (Mr. Wynn) for the fine leadership which he has shown in this matter</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400342" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I will now yield 2 1/2  minutes to the distinguished lady from Michigan, the former Secretary of State there, a distinguished Member in this body, CANDICE MILLER. </paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400276" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you. I certainly appreciate the gentleman yielding time to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, my home State of Michigan shares a very long liquid border with the nation of Canada. We have a very strong and we have a positive relationship with our neighbors to the north; but one issue that has festered in recent years is the fact that Canada has made Michigan a dumping ground for their trash. In fact, all of the municipal waste from the city of Toronto, 100 percent of it all, is carried across the border and dumped in our home State of Michigan. I do not find this to be  very neighborly. In fact, if you come to the Blue Water Bridge in St. Clair County, which is in my district, you can literally see, sometimes as far as the eye can see, these trucks lined up to enter into our country just brimming with Canadian trash. They are obviously congesting our roads, they are clogging this very vital border crossing, they are tearing up our highways, and they are threatening the safety of our drivers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pine Tree Acres, which is one of the largest landfills in Michigan, is in my district, it's in Lenox Township, and every day you can drive down and see a mountain of trash that is growing higher and higher because of all of the influx of Canadian trash that is being dumped there. And most Michigan communities plan very prudently to meet the solid waste needs of our citizens. We all took a lot of pride in planning for that. But now with the influx of all of this foreign trash, the Canadian trash,  landfills across the State are overflowing and they are reaching their capacity years sooner than was ever anticipated by the local municipalities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much of this trash presents enormous health and safety hazards to our communities as well, and to our residents. Some of the trucks have even been found to be ferrying illegal drugs into our communities. And just to give one example of the kind of dangerous trash that is being imported, just last year a Canadian truck spilled human waste, which I think Mr. Rogers referred to as well, all the way along a highway in our State, and this is simply unacceptable. In fact, I find it rather  ironic that Canada has a reputation of being environmentally conscious because it seems they are employing something of a double standard here. They find it perfectly acceptable to use Michigan as their own personal garbage can for their waste, but God forbid that they would pollute their own environment and endanger their own citizens with this trash.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the people of Michigan have had enough, but presently they have no ability to stop the flow of foreign trash, and this legislation does give them that ability. So I would urge all of my colleagues to stand with the people of Michigan and every community in our Nation, to give them the ability to protect our environment and to control the flow of foreign trash into our landfills by supporting this very important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I appreciate our colleagues' responsible action on this.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400342" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman, who has worked tirelessly on this effort in the past and has helped us craft this piece of legislation, Mr. Gillmor of Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400150" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I very much appreciate the gentleman yielding, and I am pleased to rise in support of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I introduced a similar bill in the last Congress with the cosponsorship of my friends Mr. Dingell and Mr. Rogers and much of the rest of the Michigan delegation. We were successful in getting it passed last year, but the Senate did not act. I am proud to join as a cosponsor with those gentlemen in this effort this year, and I hope we get better luck in the Senate in this session.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a commonsense bill. It gives authority to the States to regulate foreign waste which is being dumped in our landfills. The process of planning, developing and maintaining landfills is often contentious and often very expensive. Our communities should not be forced to sit back and watch as their resources are overwhelmed with trash from outside the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>International waste, as has been mentioned, has become a tremendous burden for my neighbors to the north in the State of Michigan. And while much of the foreign waste coming into the United States ultimately ends up in Michigan, this is an issue for all Americans. Our landfills are an important resource, and I believe there will come a day when Michigan's landfills have a sign outside that reads "Landfill full. Continue to Ohio." It is that domino effect that makes international waste a national  problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current law rewards the environmentally irresponsible, those who won't make the investment and face the issue of creating landfill space. It punishes the environmentally responsible, like Michigan, who have gone to the effort to make landfill space available. That situation has to change. This legislation will do it, and I am pleased to support it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400225" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today I rise to express my strong support for passage of <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill>, the International Solid Waste Importation and Management Act of 2007. Like every membr of the Michigan congressional delegation, I am a cosponsor of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many years, Canada has shipped significant amounts of solid waste into the United States, with a large percentage of it going to Michigan. It is estimated that more than four hundred trucks bring this waste into Michigan from Ontario each day. That means nearly 150,000 truckloads full of Canadian solid waste is deposited in the great State of Michigan each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of Michigan's greatest assets is the acres upon acres of beautiful land in its natural state. Michiganders are defined in part by our Great Lakes, and the health of our environment is one of our top priorities. It is imperative that we preserve our State's natural beauty, from the wilderness on Isle Royale and the Porcupine Mountains in the Upper Peninsula, all the way down to the lakes and streams in the bottom of our beloved mitten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By allowing such an immense amount of Canadian trash into our landfills we are falling short of our responsibilities as stewards of our State's health. Canadian trash represents a threat to the health of our environment and the health of our citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>States must have the authority to address this matter as they see fit. <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> is necessary in order to provide Michigan with the power to address this issue, as the U.S. Supreme Court and other Federal courts have consistently ruled that States cannot restrict out-of-state trash without action by Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passage of <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> will finally allow States to regulate the importation of international waste in ways that best suit the needs of their citizens. I thank Mr. Dingell for introducing this important legislation and urge my colleagues to support passage of <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400216" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am an original cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill>, the International Solid Waste Importation and Management Act of 2007, and am proud to join Chairman John Dingell, the Dean of the House of Representatives, my bi-partisan colleagues from Michigan and others in strong support of its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would require the U.S. to implement the "notice and consent" provisions of the 1992 bilateral U.S.-Canadian Agreement on municipal solid waste, and adds the necessary statutory enforcement authority. It also provides criteria to ensure that the views of the affected State and local governments are properly taken into account.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The importation of foreign trash is of great concern to the residents of Michigan's Fifth Congressional District, and citizens across the State vocally oppose the importation of foreign trash.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nationally, more than 4 million tons of waste--about 400 truckloads per day--is transported from Canada to the U.S. each year, with three-quarters of it coming to Michigan. In Michigan alone, Canadian trash deposits have increased more than five-fold from 1999 to 2006--from about 710,000 tons to 3.67 million tons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The growing amount of foreign trash coming into Michigan is polluting our environment, clogging our roadways, increasing the health and safety risks in our State, and poses a growing a homeland security threat. In 2006, the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General released a report finding that U.S. Customs does not have an effective method to screen and inspect the hundreds of truckloads of municipal solid waste that enter the U.S. daily through the Detroit and Port Huron  ports of entry. In addition, multiple incidents have occurred on Michigan roadways where Canadian trash trucks have spilled waste on our roads.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has had numerous opportunities to address this problem, either through legislation or the implementation of a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and Canada from 1992, which would allow Michigan to manage foreign waste being disposed of within its borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the time has come for Congress to take action to address this serious matter. <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> has broad, bipartisan support reinforced by its clear passage through the House Energy and Commerce Committee earlier this year without objection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, Madam Speaker, I strongly support <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill>, and urge my colleagues to pass this important legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill>, introduced by Chairman John Dingell from Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> is going to be considered under "suspension of the rules" which is usually reserved for non-controversial bills, but it has come to my attention that there are some strong objections both from the Canadian Embassy here in Washington D.C. as well as from the Administration, specifically the Department of State and from the United States Trade Representative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I feel it is my duty as one of the Co-Chairs of the Congressional Friends of Canada Caucus to submit for the Record letters from the Canadian Ambassador to the United States, Michael Wilson, as well as letters from the Administration to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and to Republican Leader John Boehner that express concern over <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CANADIAN EMBASSY,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, April 12, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear Madam Speaker: I am writing regarding <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill>, "International Solid Waste Importation and Management Act of 2007", approved by the Energy and Commerce Committee on March 22, 2007. I would like to share with you Canada's views on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Canada and the United States have a long-standing partnership in managing the two-way flow of hazardous and municipal solid wastes. Managing hazardous and municipal solid wastes has two components: the commercial relationship, and environmental management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the first, the trade in waste is governed by our respective rights and obligations pursuant to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreements and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). <bill type="h" number="518">HR 518</bill> will grant to states the authority to discriminate between types of waste based solely on national origin, without any environmental or sound waste management considerations. The State of Michigan has already passed Legislation that would prohibit landfill operators from accepting solid waste  from foreign sources. Canada views this legislation as inconsistent with the United States' WTO and NAFTA obligations. <bill type="h" number="518">HR 518</bill> would authorize Michigan's legislation, which would place the United States in contravention of its international trade obligations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, in 1986, both countries signed the Canada-U.S. Agreement on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes, which resulted in effective measures in both countries to ensure that hazardous wastes would be moved to the nearest safe disposal site, without regard to borders. In  1992, Canada and the United States took environmentally sound waste management one step further when they agreed to amend the agreement to include municipal solid waste.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Canada is working toward implementation of the 1992 amendment. We hope that the U.S. will take similar steps in the near future. An Environment Canada-U.S. E.P.A. pilot program in 2005, based on the Agreement, clearly demonstrated that it is possible for our two countries to work together co-operatively to ensure that municipal solid waste is shipped in an environmentally sound manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> is a departure from the principle that the sound environmental management of waste should not be impeded because of borders. Canada believes we should follow that principle for municipal solid waste, just like for hazardous waste (of which the U.S. is a net exporter to Canada).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Canada agrees that shipping municipal solid waste to Michigan is not a sustainable solution. Ontario has committed to eliminate by the end of 2010 the shipment to Michigan of all municipally managed wastes. Ontario is on target to meet this short timeline, having already taken the steps necessary to clear the first two hurdles, being 20 percent reductions for the end of each of 2007 and 2008. To that end, about 50 million tonnes of new landfill capacity has been approved by the province of Ontario  over the past two years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We therefore strongly believe that this issue can be managed without resorting to legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge you to give serious consideration to these issues and thank you for the opportunity to share Canada's views on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yours sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael Wilson,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>April 23, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear Madam Speaker: This letter is to express the Administration's concern with <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill>, the International Solid Waste Importation and Management Act of 2007. <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> would authorize states to restrict the receipt and disposal of municipal solid waste generated outside the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administration is concerned that enactment of <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> would have the unintended result of increasing the disposal of hazardous waste in the United States and lead to an unnecessary trade dispute. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, approximately 230 U.S. companies in over 32 states shipped hazardous waste to Canada in 2004 alone. If states use the authority in <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> to restrict foreign waste imports, this could provoke reciprocal actions by Canada or other trading partners  against U.S. waste exports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, because <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> would authorize states to enact laws or regulations that exclusively restrict the disposal of foreign-generated waste or limit the amount of foreign waste shipped to the United States, it could raise concerns by our trading partners regarding U.S. compliance with international rules prohibiting trade discrimination. In fact, the Government of Canada has already questioned whether <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill>, as well as the state laws and regulations it could lead to, would be compatible  with U.S. obligations under the North American Free Trade Agreement and WTO agreements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> could result in a patchwork of individual and possibly conflicting state and federal laws and regulations on the receipt and disposal of foreign municipal waste that could make it more difficult to manage cross-border waste flows in an environmentally sound and economically efficient manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, there are other ways to address concerns about imports of foreign waste. For example, the U.S.-Canada Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste has been a successful mechanism for managing the flow of hazardous waste between our countries and illustrates how issues relating to this type of trade can be handled in a manner that does not raise concerns for our trading partners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We appreciate your attention to these concerns. The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to the submission of this report from the standpoint of the President's program</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Moreover, <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> could result in a patchwork of individual and possibly conflicting state and federal laws and regulations on the receipt and disposal of foreign municipal waste that could make it more difficult to manage cross-border waste flows in an environmentally sound and economically efficient manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, there are other ways to address concerns about imports of foreign waste. For example, the U.S.-Canada Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste has been a successful mechanism for managing the flow of hazardous waste between our countries and illustrates how issues relating to this type of trade can be handled in a manner that does not raise concerns for our trading partners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We appreciate your attention to these concerns. The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to the submission of this report from the standpoint of the President's program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill>, I rise in strong support of this measure. The issue of waste coming into Michigan from Ontario is one of great concern to the people I represent, and I appreciate Representative DINGELL's tireless efforts to move this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like the bill approved by the House last year, the International Solid Waste Importation and Management Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency to implement and enforce the Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste between the United States and Canada. The Administrator is required to issue final regulations within 24 months after the date of enactment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation further requires the Administrator of EPA, when considering whether to consent to a shipment of foreign municipal solid waste to give substantial weight to the views of the recipient State or States, and also consider the impact of the shipment on local recycling programs, landfill capacity, road deterioration, homeland security, public health and the environment, among other factors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned, the bill before the House is nearly identical to the legislation that the House approved last September. Unfortunately, the former leadership of the Senate failed to take up the bill last year, despite bipartisan pleas from Michigan's House delegation urging prompt action. Now that the Senate is under new management, I hope we can at last address this longstanding problem and get a bill to the President's desk for signature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation has no closer friend in the world than Canada, but the current trash arrangement in which hundreds of trash trucks cross the border each day on their way to Michigan landfills is simply untenable. The legislation before the House builds on the agreement that Michigan's two Senators negotiated with the government of Ontario last year to reduce municipal waste shipments from Canada over the next four years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the legislation before the House.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400058" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the bill before us today, the International Solid Waste Importation and Management Act, <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill>. Last year, the House of Representatives unanimously approved this bill. While the Senate failed to take action on this important legislation, I urge my colleges in the House to send it to the other body again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an issue that transcends political partisanship. With the support of the entire Michigan delegation, and other Members representing Maryland and Virginia, <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> sends a strong signal to foreign countries, particularly Canada, that States should no longer be viewed as dumping grounds. The volume of foreign waste from Canada into Michigan continues unabated. Since 2002 Canadian  shipments of waste to Michigan have increased 83 percent. Not only  do these shipments crowd our landfills, but they also pose environmental, public health, and even national security risks. It is long past that time States are lawfully able to regulate the amount of municipal solid waste coming across the border and into their communities. <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> gives States the legal authority to regulate this waste until the Federal Government implements a 21-year-old bilateral agreement between the U.S. and Canada on this subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> does not violate trade agreements. The House has done its due diligence in crafting this legislation to avoid any potential trade issues. Simply put, <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> provides the legislative authority for the United States to implement the 1986 bilateral agreement this country signed with Canada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More specifically, the legislation authorizes and directs the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to implement and enforce the 1986 Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste between the United States and Canada. The Administrator is required to issue final regulations within 24 months after the date of enactment. Under the 1986 agreement shipments of hazardous waste require notification to the importing country and that country's consent before waste  may be shipped. The agreement was amended in 1992 to establish similar requirements for municipal solid waste. <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> provides the legislative authority for the agreement to be implemented and ensure both governments provide proper notice and shipment information before dump trucks cross the U.S. northern border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stopping trash coming into Michigan from Canada must be done through statute--not handshakes. <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> accomplishes this goal. This bill represents the first real opportunity in a long time to ensure States know in advance what is coming into their communities and where it is going.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Michigan delegation in the House of Representatives has done a terrific job of helping bring <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> to the floor for a vote. I encourage all of my colleagues to support it. I am hopeful the Senate will soon consider the measure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill>, the International Solid Waste Importation and Management Act of 2007. <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> adds a new section to the Solid Waste Disposal Act requiring the Environmental Protection Agency to implement and enforce the "notice and consent" provisions of a bilateral U.S.-Canadian Agreement signed in 1986 to govern the transboundary movement of hazardous waste. This agreement was amended in 1992 to include municipal solid waste, but neither  administration since then has made any effort to implement the bilateral agreement. Enforcement legislation promised "soon" by the present administration almost 4 years ago has yet to arrive. <bill type="h" number="518">H.R. 518</bill> provides criteria to ensure that the views of the affected State and local governments are properly taken into account, and it adds the necessary statutory enforcement authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the most recent information for fiscal year 2006, the largest source of waste imported into Michigan continues to be from Canada, with total reported imports to landfills of more than 12 million cubic yards. That is a 23 percent increase from fiscal year 2003. Even more disturbing is that the amount of Canadian waste being disposed of in Michigan has risen by 335 percent since 1996, when Michigan began collecting data.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Riverview and other downriver communities in my district have had to cope with hundreds of trucks full of Canadian trash rumbling down their streets on a daily basis for years. These trucks pass through our communities en route from the Ambassador Bridge to traffic dumps to the west. You can imagine the traffic congestion, environmental, and quality-of-life problems these truckloads of trash have created.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Local activists like Mr. George Read of Trenton and State Representative Kathleen Law have been working tirelessly alongside our congressional delegation to put an end to this never-ending flow of trash, and I am very pleased that the House today is taking a step toward that goal.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Likewise, Madam Speaker, we have no further speakers. Again, I would like to commend Chairman Dingell and the Michigan delegation for their leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
