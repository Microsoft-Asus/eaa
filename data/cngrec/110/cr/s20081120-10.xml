  <speaking speaker="412248" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is a pleasure to be back here this week. I hope the Presiding Officer and his family have a wonderful holiday season when we leave tomorrow. I rise today to talk about the proposed automaker bailout. I have tremendous empathy for all of the people involved. I spent most of my life in business. I am sure these CEOs and others leading these companies are going through tumultuous times. I empathize with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my beginning period, I was a card-carrying union member. I know there are a lot of workers who are very concerned about their future. I have tremendous empathy for them and their families. This is actually a very serious time in our history. Regardless of where you are, people are concerned about the future. I was in other parts of the world last week. All around the world, people are concerned about the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to speak to the speech of the Senator from Maryland regarding the financial component. Many of the car dealers who have called into our office actually are far less concerned about the Big Three. What they are more concerned about is having financing for consumers who are coming into  their dealerships. Like her, I want to see people throughout our country be able to operate their businesses. I am certainly not here to defend any of the Secretaries  or anybody else. I will say that I did have a conversation yesterday with Secretary Paulson and with Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke. They are putting in place a facility to deal with consumer finance that hopefully will be in place by year end to help deal with some of the financing components that are stressing the automakers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to specifically address the request by the automakers. I was privileged to be part of a hearing the other day in banking where the three CEOs and the leader of the United Auto Workers testified. I was struck by the lack of coherence, the fact that we had three leaders in corporate America whom I actually have a degree of respect for. I was in some ways embarrassed for some of them. They evidently had no plan. They felt in the Senate and in the House today the time was good for receiving  moneys from taxpayers. It was sort of a "get here while the getting is good," if you will. It was embarrassing to hear their testimony and the lack of thought that had been put into place as it related to the request. They had come up with a number of $25 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I pressed them to find out if we did, in fact, agree to loan them this $25 billion, would that be it? It was evident that, no, this was a downpayment and that they had done nothing whatsoever to think about what might happen after the taxpayers invested in them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the questions I wish to ask is: Why would we address these three automakers as some homogeneous group? They are three different companies. They are in three different circumstances. It is interesting to me that the head of the United Auto Workers knows that they are in three different circumstances. What he said was that Ford was actually in good shape. They had made some tough decisions and done some things back in the year 2006 that have put them in place to actually survive. They have  about $23 billion of cash right now. He said he had been in to look at the books and Chrysler was actually in second place. I would have thought that Chrysler actually would have been the weakest of the three. Their books are not public because they are a private company. He laid out the fact that actually Chrysler was in a stronger position but that GM was a</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wonder, in a market with 10 million cars being sold, why we need three domestic automakers. I wonder whether we would be better off if possibly we had two or we had one that was strong. Again, that is something that the market can decide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the greatest disservices we could actually do to these automakers and to the many people who depend upon them for employment, whether they be direct employees or tier 1 or 2 suppliers, is to grant them this money. That would be a major mistake. These companies have all kinds of legacy issues they have not been able to deal with. Let me point out one. General Motors has 7,000 dealers. They probably need about 1,500 dealers. What the dealers did years ago is, they went around and got States  to pass laws that said that GM could not do away with their dealerships. We have had the strong dealers actually calling our office and telling us they actually have hurt themselves by putting these State laws in place, because there are so many dealers that each of them is having trouble making a profit. It would be a tremendous disservice for us to grant money to these companies without causing them to reorganize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is something we have in this country called bankruptcy protection. There is something that allows companies to go in and reorganize, to put their strengths in order, do away with their weaknesses and actually carry on. I do hope as we debate this--I realize nothing is going to happen this week; this was kind of a preapplication; that we will probably be dealing with this in January--but I do hope we will look at this in a mature way and realize that these companies have not done the things  they should have done, maybe that they could have done, and that possibly we can be of service to them by making them do the things they need to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another example: Chrysler Company has a situation where when they idle a plant, they actually, in some cases, are obligated to pay the workers of those plants for up to 4 years beyond the time the plant is idle. I don't know of any business in the world that can survive in a healthy fashion with those types of obligations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have tremendous empathy for the people involved. One of these companies has a plant in our State. But I say to my colleagues, the worst thing we could possibly do in this situation is to acquiesce to this request that lacked coherence, lacked thoughtfulness, lacked a plan as to how these companies would be successful in the future, and let them go about their business in the way that they have been going about it. They will be back, if this money is granted. I hope we will stand firm, that  we will be responsible with taxpayer moneys, and that even though I am opposed to this, even if the money ends up being granted in some form or fashion, we will cause them to make the decisions that need to be made for them to actually be successful in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair and yield the floor.</paragraph>
