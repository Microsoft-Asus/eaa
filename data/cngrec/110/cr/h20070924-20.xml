  <narrative>
    <bill type="hc" number="210">H. Con. Res. 210</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas Sickle Cell Disease is an inherited blood disorder that is a major health problem in the United States, primarily affecting African Americans;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Sickle Cell Disease causes the rapid destruction of sickle cells, which results in multiple medical complications, including anemia, jaundice, gallstones, strokes, and restricted blood flow, damaging tissue in the liver, spleen, and kidneys, and death;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Sickle Cell Disease causes episodes of considerable pain in one's arms, legs, chest, and abdomen;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Sickle Cell Disease affects over 70,000 Americans; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas approximately 1,000 babies are born with Sickle Cell Disease each year in the United States, with the disease occurring in approximately 1 in 300 newborn African American infants;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas more than 2,000,000 Americans have the sickle cell trait, and 1 in 12 African Americans carry the trait;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas there is a 1 in 4 chance that a child born to parents who both have the sickle cell trait will have the disease;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the life expectancy of a person with Sickle Cell Disease is severely limited, with an average life span for an adult being 45 years;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, though researchers have yet to identify a cure for this painful disease, advances in treating the associated complications have occurred;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas researchers are hopeful that in less than two decades, Sickle Cell Disease may join the ranks of chronic illnesses that, when properly treated, do not interfere with the activity, growth, or mental development of affected children;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Congress recognizes the importance of researching, preventing, and treating Sickle Cell Disease by authorizing treatment centers to provide medical intervention, education, and other services and by permitting the Medicaid program to cover some primary and secondary preventative medical strategies for children and adults with Sickle Cell Disease;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, Inc. remains the preeminent advocacy organization that serves the sickle cell community by focusing its efforts on public policy, research funding, patient services, public awareness, and education related to developing effective treatments and a cure for Sickle Cell Disease; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, Inc. has requested that the Congress designate September as Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month in order to educate communities across the Nation about sickle cell and the need for research funding, early detection methods, effective treatments, and prevention programs: Now, therefore, be it</narrative>
  <narrative> Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That the Congress supports the goals and ideals of Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) and the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H. Con. Res 210, which pays homage to a tradition that both the Senate and House have honored for over two decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1983, Congress first recognized September as the month to nationally commemorate sickle cell disease awareness. And it is in that same vein today that I ask for support of H. Con. Res 210.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by affected red blood cells that mutate into the shape of a crescent or sickle, and as such are unable to pass through small blood vessels. The horrific outcomes of this condition include considerable pain in one's arms, chest, legs and abdomen, anemia, gallstone, strokes, as well as damaging tissue in the liver, spleen, kidney, and death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This disease affects over 70,000 Americans and cripples over 1,000 newborn babies each year in the United States. By supporting H. Con. Res 210, we acknowledge the importance of raising awareness for advance in sickle cell disease research, prevention treatment and potential cure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the sponsor of H. Con. Res 210, I would urge all of my colleagues to support swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also just note, Mr. Speaker, that the devastation of this disease on those who are affected by it is, indeed, tremendous. I have had firsthand experience with it by virtue of having run a sickle cell community education project for the University of Illinois in Chicago and came in contact with many of the patients and their families; saw the pain and suffering firsthand. And so I would urge passage of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Mr. Davis for bringing this important resolution to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution seeks to bring attention to sickle cell disease and to support the designation of September as Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sickle cell disease is a deadly genetic blood disorder that strikes primarily people of African descent. Those affected by the disease most often appear to be healthy, but their lives are disturbed by sporadic and painful attacks in their arms, legs, chest and abdomen. SCD also causes the rapid destruction of sickle cells that results in multiple medical complications, including anemia, jaundice, gallstones, strokes, and restricted blood flow causing tissue damage, cardiovascular and organ damage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Approximately 80,000 African Americans suffer from sickle cell disease, and millions are affected worldwide. Statistics shockingly show that one in every 350 African American babies born in the United States has the disease, and one in eight African American babies carry the sickle cell trait. There is a one-in-four chance that a child born to parents who both carry the sickle cell trait will have the disease. Life expectancy is limited, as an average life span for an adult with the disease is  only about 45 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A universal cure, though, remains elusive. However, early diagnosis through newborn screening and education has improved survival and quality of life for those who suffer from SCD. Because SCD affects so many people and research funding is critical to effectively treating and ultimately preventing the disease, we are grateful for organizations such as the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America that continue to shine the light of hope for all of those affected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, I ask my colleagues to support the designation of the month of September as National Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month so that communities throughout the country will become aware of this disease and the need for additional research, effective treatments and prevention programs that will ultimately lead to a cure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support House Concurrent Resolution 210.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
