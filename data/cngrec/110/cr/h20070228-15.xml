  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as the USS Cole patrolled the seas around Yemen, a boat piloted by al-Qaeda international criminals drew near to the Navy destroyer and bombed the ship. On that day in the year 2000, 17 American soldiers were murdered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The families of these 17 soldiers are now suing the Sudanese Government for damages. Why? Because the Sudan funded and provided training for these terrorists. The Sudanese Government is outraged that they should be held financially responsible. However, a U.S. Federal court judge disagrees and is allowing the victims' families to continue their pursuit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sudan is now asking the U.S. Supreme Court to dismiss this unique lawsuit. But the Supreme Court must allow this case to proceed and the victims to obtain justice. Sudan fed the terrorist cells that attacked the Cole. They gave them safe harbor and let them exist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. citizens murdered by international terrorists overseas must be able to seek damages from the country responsible for the crime. The message to these nations that sponsor terror, you too will pay for your sins when you sponsor international outlaws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
