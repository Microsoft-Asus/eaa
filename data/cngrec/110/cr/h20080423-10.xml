    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues to honor the hundreds of thousands of American students across the country who will participate in the National Day of Silence this Friday to call attention to anti-LGBT name-calling, bullying, and harassment in their schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By taking a vow of silence, students from more than 5,000 middle and high schools will call attention to hate-motivated harassment faced by individuals in school and in work, and they will work toward improving their school climate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year's event will be held in memory of Lawrence King, an 8th-grade student who was shot and killed on February 12 by a classmate because of his sexual orientation and gender expression. Larry's death is an unnecessary reminder of what we already know: lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students continue to face pervasive harassment and victimization in schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As students use their silence to demand schools are safe for all students, it is my hope we in Congress use our voices to ensure that it will be so.</paragraph>
