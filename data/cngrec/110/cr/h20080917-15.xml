  <narrative>REPUBLICANS ARE STILL JUST TALKING -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8281]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. ALTMIRE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for 6 years, the Republicans had control of Congress and of the White House, and for 6 years, the American people waited for them to do something to end our dependence on foreign oil, but despite their constant cry of "drill, baby, drill," the Republicans didn't act on this issue when they had control, and 2 years ago, the American people voted for new leadership in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, yesterday, that new leadership--the Democrats in this House--answered the call by passing a landmark energy bill that triples the available territory for offshore drilling. Let me repeat that. The bill we passed yesterday triples the amount of territory in the Outer Continental Shelf that is available for drilling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Predictably, many in the minority demonstrated by their votes that they're more interested in having a political issue for the coming election than they are in actually solving the problem. While Democrats have taken decisive action by passing a comprehensive energy bill that includes an unprecedented expansion of offshore drilling, Republicans, as you will hear today, are still just talking.</paragraph>
