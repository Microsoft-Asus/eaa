    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to introduce the newest Member of our body from Ohio, Mr. Robert Latta.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a lot that I can say. He has an outstanding record in the Ohio legislature. He has a lot of community activities. One that I especially like is he was very active in the 4-H program, and that's something close to my heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let me say, Bob, you have a wonderful legacy to uphold here. Your father served here for 30 years, an outstanding Member, Del Latta, for a few of us that still remember him well, a great Member. And then you succeed Paul Gillmor, who had 20 years of outstanding service. So the 5th District of Ohio has had 50 years as a legacy of great service. And looking at your record in the Ohio legislature, I know that you will carry on the same record of great service to the people of that district  and to the State of Ohio. And I'm happy, as the senior Member, to welcome you as a new Member of this great body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400211" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And on behalf of our entire Buckeye delegation, and with poignancy on this occasion, during this season of new light, please let me welcome Congressman Robert Latta of Wood County, Ohio, to the ranks of the 110th Congress of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can share with our colleagues that Bob is a man who has lived the commandment, "Honor thy father and thy mother." Delbert and Rosemary must be so elated today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob also has honored his in-laws, Mr. and Mrs. Vern and Carol Sloan of Williams County, such very, very good citizens. Bob's father Delbert, as Ralph has said, served dutifully for three decades in this Chamber until 1989. What a Christmas gift this swearing-in must be for the Latta and Sloan families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob has been a loving husband to his gifted wife, Marcia, and a real father to his daughters, Elizabeth and Maria. I know how proud they all are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His public service has been exemplary, with 15 years of service in the Ohio legislature. We welcome him warmly to the ranks of the Ohio delegation. Indeed, we need his help to pull our Buckeye State forward in more than football.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me wish you and your family Godspeed on behalf of our entire delegation with healthy and productive years of service to our blessed Nation. Onward, and congratulations.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Madam Speaker, for allowing me a brief moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Representative Regula. Representative Kaptur, thank you very much for your nice remarks. I really appreciate that. I know that my dad always enjoyed serving with you and riding on the plane back and forth from Toledo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a great honor to be here today. I'll tell you, it's a humbling experience. Because of all the years when I was younger and Dad was in Congress here and being able to come onto this floor, I never dreamed there would be a day when I would be standing in this well to address the Members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to say this, that as we were walking here today from the Metro and walking between the Cannon and Longworth and looking up the street and seeing that dome of the Capitol Building, I understood how humbling of an experience this really is. I truly believe we are truly blessed to be one of 435 to represent such a great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with all of you in the future. And I just want to thank you very much for this ability to be here with you today, and also, Madam Speaker, again, for allowing me to speak. I really appreciate it. Thank you very much.</paragraph>
