    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me read you a line from today's Wall Street Journal: "The latest Los Angeles Times-Bloomberg survey finds that Congress' approval rating is down to 27 percent, with 63 percent of the public saying Democrats are practicing `business as usual.' "</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The frustration of the American people is real and growing. Every weekend I hear it in the voices of my constituents, regardless of their affiliation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Almost all south central Michiganders have the same message: control runaway government spending, maintain the highest of ethical standards, and put an end to wasteful pork barrel spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The actions of Congress this week not only continue the culture of corruption currently plaguing the capital city, but also are an insult to an American public that longs for transparency and accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together, Democrats and Republicans must seize this opportunity and use it to enact real reform that values how taxpayer dollars are being spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that by limiting the size and scope of government and making certain taxpayer dollars go to meaningful programs, Congress can restore public trust and build a better, brighter future for our country.</paragraph>
