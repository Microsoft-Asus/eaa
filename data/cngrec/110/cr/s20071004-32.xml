  <narrative>SCHIP -- (Senate - October 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12766">S12766</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about a program that is important to me and to the low-income children in this country: the State Children's Health Insurance Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a strong supporter of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and want the program to cover all uninsured, lower income children. I fully support a reauthorization of this program, but I also support the President's decision to veto the flawed SCHIP bill sent to him by Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SCHIP legislation that was vetoed by the President yesterday includes frivolous spending, expands coverage to children already covered by private insurance and neglects the original intent of the program--to provide health coverage for low-income children. While I support the reauthorization of SCHIP, I do not support legislation that expands the program and serves as an initial step towards government-run health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State Children's Health Insurance Program works! It has enrolled low-income eligible children in a health coverage program to ensure that they have adequate access to coverage and services. While the program is certainly a success, there are some oversights that need to be addressed. Congress has been given the opportunity to tackle these issues with the reauthorization of the program. In Colorado we have yet to enroll all of the currently eligible children of low-income families into the  SCHIP program. We should focus our attention on enrolling these children instead of fighting over an expansion of the program. Expanding eligibility requirements would only make it harder for the neediest children in Colorado, and the Nation, to receive coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a strong supporter of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and want the program to cover all uninsured, lower income children. I support giving Americans the opportunity to access health care, and giving them the ability to purchase affordable suitable private coverage. I support the effort by many Members of this body to spend in a fiscally responsible way, without increasing taxes or using budget gimmicks. More importantly, I support putting children first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State Children's Health Insurance Program was put in place to cover low-income children who would otherwise not have access to health coverage. The SCHIP agreement that passed the House and Senate not only disregards the original intent of the program, but also reauthorizes the program in a fiscally irresponsible manner that will end up costing the taxpayers $12.5 billion in the final year of the authorization. For example, the revenue source for the reauthorization is being sold as a tax  increase on cigarettes which is expected to reduce the number of people smoking, but this is an unstable revenue source. I don't agree with paying for a program as important as the State Children's Health Insurance Program with an unsustainable income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State Children's Health Insurance Program can be reauthorized in a way that increases the number of enrolled children who are currently eligible for the program. While I oppose the expansion of the program, I do not oppose reauthorization and therefore I am cosponsoring the SCHIP Extension Act of 2007, <bill type="s" number="2086">S. 2086</bill>, which will fully fund the current program for 18 months, and give Congress more time to discuss the best way to reauthorize the program. SCHIP was scheduled to expire on September  30 and it is imperative that Congress reauthorize the current program to ensure that children of lower income families still receive health coverage. I will also be cosponsoring the Kids First Act, as an alternative proposal for the reauthorization of the SCHIP program.</paragraph>
