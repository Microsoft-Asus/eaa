    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in consideration of <bill type="h" number="3233">H.R. 3233</bill>, which names a postal facility in Piney Woods, Mississippi, after Laurence C. and Grace M. Jones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3233">H.R. 3233</bill>, which was introduced by Representative CHARLES PICKERING on July 31, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on September 20 of 2007 by voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire Mississippi congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Dr. Laurence Clifton Jones was born on November 21, 1882, in St. Joseph, Missouri. He attended the University of Iowa and graduated in 1907. Due to racial oppression and widespread poverty among African Americans, he decided to establish a school in Piney Woods, Mississippi, to educate young people. He started the Piney Woods School with just $2 and three students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Jones married Ms. Grace M. Allen in 1912. She became a pivotal helpmate to her husband by performing fund-raising activities for the Piney Woods School. Mrs. Jones was an educator and taught courses in domestic science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Laurence and Grace Jones were dedicated educators who left a legacy in keeping with their principles, "educating the head, hearts and hands" of young people. The school they built continues to this day on a 60-acre campus among a 2,000-acre wooded site with an enrollment of 275 students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Piney Woods School is the largest of four remaining historically black boarding high schools in the United States. It is a college preparatory high school with grades 9-12, where many students graduate and go on to college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend my colleague, Representative CHARLES "Chip" PICKERING, for introducing this legislation and urge the swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to support today <bill type="h" number="3233">H.R. 3233</bill>, naming the postal facility in Piney Woods, Mississippi, the Laurence C. and Grace M. Jones Post Office Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Laurence Jones was well-known in Mississippi history for founding the Piney Woods School in 1909. After graduating from the University of Iowa, he returned to his home State of Missouri, where he was sought out by a local Baptist church to create a school for black children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jones found himself by himself in an abandoned sheep shed with no students, but one day a small barefoot boy arrived seeking a lesson. The next day, this young boy came back with two friends. This simple and small beginning grew over the years to what is now a premier educational institution, teaching 300 high school students on a 300-acre campus. Piney Woods is the country's largest African American boarding school and the oldest continually operating African American boarding school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Laurence's wife, Grace, was also an educator. They met in Iowa, where she had established a similar school for black children. Upon moving to Mississippi, she helped raise funds for Piney Woods and also taught classes. They believed in the importance of providing these youths with the educational opportunity they deserved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Laurence and Grace Jones were pioneers in the education system in the early 1900s. Their historic achievements are worthy of this recognition, and I am pleased to support <bill type="h" number="3233">H.R. 3233</bill>.</paragraph>
