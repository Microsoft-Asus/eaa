    <paragraph>Mr. President, I voted against the supplemental appropriations bill because of the provision which specifies a withdrawal date. With President Bush's statement that he will veto the bill, it will be returned to Congress so that we can negotiate with the White House to provide funding to support the troops without a withdrawal date which allows our enemies to wait us out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I voted against the supplemental appropriations bill for the same reasons that I voted in favor of Senator COCHRAN's amendment to strike a withdrawal date, which amendment failed. The full statement of my reasons appear in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD in the proceedings on March 28, 2007, in relation to the Cochran amendment.</paragraph>
