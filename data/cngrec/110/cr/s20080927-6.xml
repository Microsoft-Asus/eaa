  <narrative>CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER ACT OF 2008 -- (Senate - September 27, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9881">S9881</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 611, <bill type="h" number="5159">H.R. 5159</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will report the bill by title.</chair>
  <narrative>The legislative clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>A bill (<bill type="h" number="5159">H.R. 5159</bill>) to establish the Office of the Capitol Visitor Center within the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, headed by the Chief Executive Officer for Visitor Services, to provide for the effective management and administration of the Capitol Visitor Center, and other purposes.</narrative>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. DEMINT, Mr. President, I rise to speak on the newest addition to the U.S. Capitol, the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center.</narrative>
  <narrative>I have been told by the Architect of the Capitol that the CVC is scheduled to open its doors to the public for the first time on December 2 of this year. I have toured this impressive facility, and I believe it will be a vast improvement in the experience visitors will have when touring the Capitol Complex. I look forward to the opening of this long awaited addition; it will be a momentous and historic occasion.</narrative>
  <narrative>However, in addition to providing security and functionality, the CVC also provides an educational experience designed to tell the story of our Nation's Capitol. I believe it is critical that this history appropriately and accurately reflects the traditions and history of the Capitol.</narrative>
  <narrative>We want our constituents and visitors from around the world to get an accurate portrayal of the Capitol's history and, as much as possible, to understand the motivations and inspirations of those who have led our branch of Government since its establishment 220 years go.</narrative>
  <narrative>Tragically, as the CVC exists now, they will get a much different experience.</narrative>
  <narrative>In touring the CVC, I found the exhibits to be politically correct, left leaning, and secular in nature. The secular aspects were especially surprising because of the deep connection between faith and the Capitol, and our Judeo Christian traditions. But despite this connection and our traditions, the doors to the CVC are flanked with a quote from former Congressman Rufus Choate that says, "We have built no temple but the Capitol. We consult no common oracle but the Constitution." Even a brief  reflection on our Nation's history will show this quote is not accurate and, in my opinion, grossly inappropriate.</narrative>
  <narrative>The first thing you are confronted with once you have entered the CVC is the phrase "E. Pluribus Unum" engraved in stone above a mock of the Capitol dome. A panel next to the dome describes E. Pluribus Unum as our Nation's motto. This is not only completely false but also offensive to the 90 percent of Americans who approve of our Nation's actual motto "In God We Trust," signed into law by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1956.</narrative>
  <narrative>Unfortunately, nowhere in the CVC will you find the words "In God We Trust" engraved in stone. The acknowledgement of God and our Nation's motto has been left out of the CVC. In fact, the massive replica of the House Chamber omits the "In God We Trust" from above the Speaker's chair.</narrative>
  <narrative>We are now told they are planning to fix this "mistake," but on my tour 2 days ago, it was still missing. Also missing are the words to our Pledge of Allegiance, the only words spoken each morning by both Chambers of Congress.</narrative>
  <narrative>There are a few articles in the CVC that reflect elements of faith--two Bibles, a picture of the congressional nondenominational faith space, and the oath of office--but I believe they grossly understate the prominent role of faith and Judeo Christian values in the history of this great building.</narrative>
  <narrative>I have worked with the Senator BENNETT, the ranking member of the Rules Committee, this week to address some of my concerns. After several conversations, he and Senator FEINSTEIN, the chairman of the Rules Committee, sent me a letter formalizing an agreement to make some changes. Our agreement includes engraving "In God We Trust" in stone in a prominent location within the CVC; engraving "The Pledge of Allegiance" in stone in a prominent location within the CVC; removing the  words "Our Nation's motto" from the Unity panel on the Wall of Aspirations and replacing it with a new panel.</narrative>
  <narrative>I will ask unanimous consent to have a copy of this letter be printed in the RECORD.</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition, I have a verbal agreement with Senator BENNETT that the Architect of the Capitol will be instructed to consider the rich faith heritage of our Nation when considering the content of any future display. I would like to thank my friend for his help on this issue, and I look forward to working with him in the future.</narrative>
  <narrative>I am very pleased with this progress in improving the accuracy of the CVC. However, I am still distressed by what remains or, rather, what is missing.</narrative>
  <narrative>There seems to be a trend of whitewashing God out of our history. The last two major memorials in Washington--the FDR and World War II Memorials--left out references to God and persons of faith, the first time a memorial or monument in Washington has not had a quote, reference, or  inscription referencing God or the faith of those we are memorializing.</narrative>
  <narrative>Now it can be said these are not intentional omissions, but consider this: last year the Architect of the Capitol censored God from a certificate accompanying a flag flown over the Capitol by a Boy Scout for his grandfather; a national cemetery director stopped an honor guard from performing the traditional burial ceremony because it mentioned God; "In God We Trust" was removed from the front of our currency; schools have been sued over having the pledge of allegiance every morning; and the  list goes on.</narrative>
  <narrative>It appears that many would prefer to ignore the role and prominence of God and faith in our Nation's history and the lives of the American people today. But I want to make sure unelected bureaucrats are not removing these references just because they are afraid of offending a vocal minority, despite the overwhelming will of the American people. I can assure you, this is something that I will continue to fight against.</narrative>
  <narrative>I would like to take just a moment to detail a few of the many examples of our faith heritage that could be included in future displays: the Aitken Bible of 1782, the only Bible ever printed by an act of Congress; church services held in the Capitol for over 70 years while Congress was in session, becoming the largest church in Washington in 1867; pictures of National Day of Prayer events or the March for Life, both of which are attended by hundreds of thousands of citizens each year; the text  of President Lincoln's second Inaugural and his Bible to go with the table from which he delivered his address, which is already in the CVC; a description of all the paintings in the Rotunda on the virtual tour monitors found in the CVC; and a picture of Members of Congress gathering spontaneously on the Capitol steps to sing "God Bless America" on September 11.</narrative>
  <narrative>In the words of Benjamin Franklin: "We have been assured in the sacred writings that except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it. I firmly believe this and I also believe that without His concurring aid, we shall succeed in this political building no better than the builders of Babel."</narrative>
  <narrative>I also firmly believe this. And while I firmly believe every person has the right to their own opinion and the blessing of religious freedom, that freedom is the freedom of religion, not freedom from religion. We don't have to agree with our Founding Fathers and the history of our country, but that doesn't mean we can change it. Daniel Webster said in this very building, "God grants liberty only to those who love it, and are always ready to guard and defend it." We must remember our history  and the faith of our fathers; it is what formed us into the great Nation we are today.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of the letter to which I referred printed in the RECORD.</narrative>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>AND ADMINISTRATION,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, September 26, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR JIM, After many years of anticipation the Architect of the Capitol is preparing for the opening of the new Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) on December 2, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>Delaying the opening of the CVC has serious security implications. The CVC was designed so that public visitors will be screened at one secure location, improving security in the U.S. Capitol for constituents, staff and Members.</narrative>
  <narrative>Delaying the opening of the CVC also has significant financial consequences. As you are aware, the CVC has already cost $621 million for construction. The Architect is currently paying the cost of salaries and benefits for staff preparing to open and operate the facility for the American public. Every day the CVC is closed to the public, it will cost the taxpayer $72,040 in unused staff resources.</narrative>
  <narrative>In response to your letter dated September 25, 2008, we agree in principle to support engraving "In God We Trust" in stone in a prominent location within the CVC; engraving "The Pledge of Allegiance" in stone in a prominent location within the CVC; and removing the words "Our Nation's Motto" from the Unity panel on the Wall of Aspirations of the Exhibition Hall in the CVC, and replacing it with a new panel.</narrative>
  <narrative>We recognize that one of your suggestions (renaming "Our Nation's Motto") is a correction, and the "Pledge" and "In God We Trust" are additions. The approximate cost of doing all three projects, according to the Architect of the Capitol, is $150,000.</narrative>
  <narrative>We are pleased that you have agreed to Senate consideration of the CVC legislation.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Dianne Feinstein,</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;center&gt;Chairman.</narrative>
  <narrative>Robert F. Bennett,</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;center&gt;Ranking Member. </narrative>
