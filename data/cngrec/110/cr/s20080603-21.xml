  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have sought recognition to recognize an outstanding Pennsylvania citizen, L. Robert Kimball.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1953, L. Robert Kimball opened the doors of a surveying and civil engineering consulting company in Ebensburg, PA. Under Mr. Kimball's leadership over the past 55 years, L. Robert Kimball &amp; Associates has grown from a 2-person outfit to a 600-person firm which now oversees nearly 1,200 projects a year in 14 offices across the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>L. Robert Kimball's leadership has not gone unnoticed. Among his many commendations are the Outstanding Engineering Alumnus Award and the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Pennsylvania State University, the Western Pennsylvania Family Business of the Year Award from the University of Pittsburgh's Katz Graduate School of Business, and the Small Business Person of the Year Award from the Small Business Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will conclude by commending the four guiding principles that Mr. Kimball instills in each his staff: have a goal, be persistent, know when to change direction, and enjoy your work.</paragraph>
