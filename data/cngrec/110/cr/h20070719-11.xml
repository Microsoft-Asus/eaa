    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, here are some grim statistics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As of today, 1,095,890 cases, 49,320 deaths, and a cost of $27,397,260,282. This is not a war. These are infections that people pick up in hospitals, and these are based upon CDC estimates of 90,000 deaths per year. But a more recent study came from the Association for Professionals in Infection Control, say the numbers can be as high as 119,000 deaths and 12 million cases per year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When will we start acting to make sure that we have all hospitals act, as so many have done, to eliminate infections from hospitals?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to cosponsor and to help pass <bill type="h" number="1174">H.R. 1174</bill>, the Healthy Hospitals Act. It is time we stop wasting health care dollars, health insurance dollars and wasting lives and start saving lives in hospitals the way so many hospitals have been able to do. Please, let's get moving to make our hospitals healthier.</paragraph>
