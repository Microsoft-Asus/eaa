  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the North American Aerospace Defense Command Agreement between the United States and Canada. For my State of Colorado, today is an especially proud and gratifying occasion as it is home to the headquarters of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, located at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 12, 1958, the United States and Canada signed an official agreement creating the unique and fully integrated binational North American Aerospace Defense Command, commonly known as NORAD. Administered by the United States Air Force in conjunction with Canadian Forces, NORAD is a premier military command that uses the most innovative technology and equipment to secure our skies. Today, 50 years after its inception, we honor NORAD and pay tribute to the men and women who have served and continue  to serve NORAD's mission with humility and distinction. To these American and Canadian servicemembers, I say thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For five decades, NORAD's mission has been to prevent air attacks against North America and safeguard the sovereign airspaces of the United States and Canada by responding to unknown, unwanted and unauthorized air activity approaching or operating within our airspaces. In more recent years, NORAD's mission has evolved to include collaborative efforts with civilian law enforcement officers to detect  and monitor aircraft suspected of trafficking illegal  drugs to North America. In addition, NORAD has developed a system to help our homeland defense and security partners observe North American seas and to warn of encroaching maritime threats. In pursuit of these missions, NORAD has achieved remarkable success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years NORAD has strengthened the venerable relationship between the United States and Canada. It has been a source of stability for our two nations during good times and bad. Throughout the turbulent Cold War, and now in the midst of the war on terror, NORAD is responsible for continually bringing together bright and courageous minds to help detect, deter and defend against lethal threats to the North American continent. Furthermore, NORAD has become a model for international defense  cooperation. It has allowed for the necessary enhancement of information and intelligence sharing between Canadian and American militaries, intelligence agencies, and other security organizations. Twenty four hours a day, 7 days a week, NORAD units all over North America are alert, prepared and equipped to take action to defend our continent and to safeguard our freedoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout my nearly 18 years in the U.S. Congress, I have spent quite a bit of time with the commanders at NORAD, and each time we visit I am encouraged by their efforts and reminded of why America is, and will always be, great. With the safety and security of America entrusted to institutions like NORAD and to the brave men and women of our armed forces, I am confident that America will be protected for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Especially since the horrific events of September 11, 2001, and the launch of the war on terror, the continued resolve of the United States and Canada to pay any cost to face any foe is more relevant than ever. If we are to remain sovereign and free, America and Canada must continue to adapt to a changing world and respond effectively to evolving threats. I am confident in our ability to do so. Through NORAD and other binational partnerships, America and Canada will jointly and efficiently combat  any threat we confront in the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, as a nation, we honor the legacy and achievements of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, and we look forward to another half century of this successful partnership so that NORAD can continue to provide for the protection of our airspace and our homeland. I offer my sincere congratulations to the North American Aerospace Defense Command for 50 years of extraordinary service to the United States and Canada.</paragraph>
