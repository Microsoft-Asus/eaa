  <narrative>DEMOCRAT HOAX BILL WAS ALL ABOUT POLITICAL COVER -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8401]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, the House had a choice. They could support a bipartisan energy plan that invests in renewable energy resources, supports conservation and expands exploration for American oil and natural gas. It was not a perfect bill. There were additional items like nuclear energy that were not addressed, and should be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, House Democrats made a different choice. They decided to stand with their leadership and support a hoax of an energy bill that had no input from the minority, had been crafted overnight by the House Democrat leadership, and failed to provide revenue sharing for States that authorized deepwater drilling off their shores. Moreover, the Democrat bill had a renewable energy mandate that would mean higher electricity bills for families of southern and midwestern States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was a bipartisan choice, and I am disappointed that so many chose to vote for a hoax bill that was all about political cover.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
