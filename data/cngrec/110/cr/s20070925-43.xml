  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to correct a press release issued by my office on August 2, 2007. In this release, we correctly quoted Senator Baucus during the SCHIP debate when he stated, "We're the only country in the industrialized world that does not have universal coverage. I think the Children's Health Insurance Program is another step to move toward universal coverage."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Due to a misplaced quotation mark in the release, the following statement I made on the floor was included in the same quotation attributed to Senator Baucus: "Everyone realizes that the goal of this legislation moves us a giant step further down the road to nationalizing healthcare, which would result in a drop in quality and in rationing." Although this is an accurate quote, it should have been attributed to me and not Senator Baucus, and I apologize for any confusion that  our press release may have created.</paragraph>
