    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="433">H.R. 433</bill>, legislation naming a postal facility in Little Rock, Arkansas, after Scipio Africanus Jones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Jones was an African American lawyer, judge, professor and humanitarian. Born in 1863 as a slave, he is most noted for his work to appeal the conviction and death sentence of 12 black sharecroppers for their involvement in the Elaine Race Riot. The Elaine Race Riot is one of the bloodiest racial conflicts in American history. Mr. Jones' work brought the case to the United States Supreme Court, and as a result found mob driven trials violated the due process clause of the 14th amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Jones also made history when he personally purchased $50,000 worth of Liberty Bonds, which helped support the Allied war efforts in the First World War. Soon thereafter, President Woodrow Wilson appointed him to the Liberty Bond National Advisory Board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later in his life, he continued to advocate against racial discrimination. He fought for black voting rights and worked with Thurgood Marshall in a case ensuring fair pay for African American teachers. His contribution impacted society's treatment towards blacks in a powerful way, and for this we all should be proud and remember him dearly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, February 1 marks the beginning of Black History Month. It is the time when we take time to honor the commitments and struggles of African Americans and try to understand their struggles. It is only fitting that during this month we honor a man whose perseverance and dedication to his community and fellow African Americans broke through and broke down historic barriers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 3, 1863, Scipio Africanus Jones was born in Smith Township, Arkansas. His mother had been a slave. Scipio Jones attended black schools in the area and then moved to Little Rock to attend preparatory courses at Philander Smith College. From there he earned his Bachelor's Degree from North Little Rock's Bethel University, now known as Shorter College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But his interest in education did not stop there. He recognized the continuing struggle African Americans face in achieving equal rights, and knew he could contribute through Arkansas' legal system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Jones offered to work unpaid as a janitor at the offices of the local U.S. district judge. There he began to read law books and became an apprentice in law under Circuit Judge Robert Lea. He was accepted into the American Bar Association in 1889. From there, he was admitted to practice in the circuit court of Pulaski County in Little Rock.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1900, he was admitted to the State Supreme Court, then the United States District Court, the United States Supreme Court, and the United States Court of Appeals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>He was a strong member of his community and joined several local fraternal organizations. He even turned down offers to serve as the ambassador to the Republic of Haiti, as well as the Recorder of Deeds in the District of Columbia so he could support the Little Rock area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was treasurer of the National Negro Bar Association, the National Attorney General of the Mosaic Templars of America, a member of the International Order of Twelve, and a member of the Knights and Daughters of Tabor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through his work in these fraternal organizations, he became known as the "Gibraltar of Negro fraternal beneficiary societies."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Jones is famous for his defense in the trial of the Elaine Twelve. In 1919 a group of black sharecroppers met in Elaine, Arkansas, to discuss creating their own unit and whether to bring a class action lawsuit against their landlords for not paying them appropriate shares for their homegrown crops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When a local sheriff and railroad detective, both white, showed up to the meeting, a fight arose. It quickly spread through the town and lasted for 3 days. It grew so intense that 600 Federal troops came to the area to quiet the fighting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the end, 99 black men were arrested. Twelve of the men received a trial that lasted only 20 minutes and sentenced them to death. With Scipio's efforts he pushed their case to the Supreme Court of the United States, which successfully gave all 12 men a new trial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond his legal work, Mr. Jones was a passionate businessman. He was the founder and owner of People's Ice and Fuel Company. He also founded Arkansas's Negro Business League.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Scipio Jones fought hard his whole life for the rights of his fellow African Americans. He knew a better way of life could be had for his community members. He was a prominent leader, lawyer, educator, businessman, and politician. It is so appropriate that we honor a man of such determination, pride and integrity during Black History Month with the naming of this post office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, I am in awe of this gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
