  <narrative>The text of the resolution is as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="1149">H. Res. 1149</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas sarcoidosis is a noncontagious systemic disease of unknown origin and is commonly diagnosed with the detection of inflamed, microscopic growths called granulomas that grow and often affect the lungs, skin, eyes, and nervous system;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas sarcoidosis can affect any organ of the body and more than one organ at any given time; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the inflammation of such vital organs may cause seizures, blindness, disfiguring lesions, and heart failure;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas many individuals stricken with sarcoidosis eventually develop a serious disabling or potentially fatal condition;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas sarcoidosis was once thought to be an uncommon condition, but is now known to affect tens of thousands of people throughout the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas sarcoidosis afflicts African-Americans up to 8 times more frequently than other races;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas as many people with sarcoidosis have no symptoms, it is difficult to measure how many people have the condition;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas sarcoidosis is a disease that affects Americans nationwide and people around the world, and yet its causes and potential treatments remain a mystery;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas skin-related symptoms of this chronic, multisystemic disease were first recognized more than 100 years ago, but the effects of the disease on other organs were not observed until the first quarter of this century;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas sarcoidosis was the chief diagnosis of the death of fluorescent light bulb workers in Salem, Massachusetts in the 1940s;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas sarcoidosis was the first diagnosis for an overwhelming majority of rescue workers' health conditions on September 11, 2001;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas sarcoidosis has been documented to be disproportionately found among factory workers and Navy deckgrinders;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas today, researchers are still trying to learn more about the causes, cures, and overall nature of this affliction;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the American Lung Association has actively advocated for more research to better understand how environmental and occupational exposures may increase the risk of sarcoidosis;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the National Sarcoidosis Society strives to serve those afflicted by the disease by focusing its efforts on public policy, research funding, patient services, public awareness and education, and finding a cure; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas April 2008 would be appropriate to designate as National Sarcoidosis Awareness Month to increase public awareness of the need to support individuals with sarcoidosis, to raise awareness of the environmental and occupational issues associated with sarcoidosis, and to educate medical professionals who care for individuals with sarcoidosis: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Sarcoidosis Awareness Month;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) recognizes that sarcoidosis has played a prominent yet hidden role in America's workforce history;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) acknowledges the diligent efforts of individuals and organizations who observe National Sarcoidosis Awareness Month with appropriate activities to further promote awareness of the disease; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (4) supports research efforts to better understand the links between sarcoidosis and specific occupations where sarcoidosis is disproportionately represented.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 1149, commemorating April 2008 as National Sarcoidosis Awareness Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, tens of thousands of Americans nationwide are afflicted with this disease. However, currently, there is no cure, no definitive identification of exactly what causes sarcoidosis, no known measures to prevent it, and many people who have sarcoidosis do not exhibit any symptoms. So one might ask the question, what is sarcoidosis?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sarcoidosis is characterized by the inflammation associated with the production of tiny lumps of cells in various organs of our bodies called granulomas because they look like grains of sugar or sand. These grain-like cells grow and clump together in an organ, affecting how the organ works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The increase of these growths can inflame vital organs like the lung, brain, skin, eyes and nervous system, causing seizures, blindness, disfiguring lesions, heart failure and sometimes even death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sarcoidosis is overrepresented among African Americans compared to other races and ethnic groups, and afflicts African Americans more severely than other races in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By documenting the prevalence of sarcoidosis among fluorescent light bulb workers in the 1940s and among U.S. Navy deck grinders, and recognizing that sarcoidosis disproportionately affects factory workers and was the first diagnosis for an overwhelming majority of rescue workers in New York after the September 11, 2001, attacks, researchers at the American Lung Association have uncovered a link between certain types of occupations and this disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More careful monitoring of a sarcoidosis diagnosis can dramatically improve public health, including the health of civilian and military workers. It is my hope that by passing this legislation, we will promote more careful examination and investigation of sarcoidosis diagnosis, and lead to the reduction of morbidity and mortality of workers, as well as reduce costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By supporting House Resolution 1149 designating April 2008 as National Sarcoidosis Awareness Month, we as the House of Representatives of these United States of America will demonstrate our acknowledgment of and commitment to the importance of raising awareness for the purpose of uncovering the causes of sarcoidosis disease, environmental and otherwise, and the promotion of strategies to support and protect our thriving workforce. I urge passage of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="1149">H. Res. 1149</bill>, expressing support for the designation of the month of April 2008 as National Sarcoidosis Awareness Month to bring attention to this disease, its potential causes, and the need for research on the causes and potential treatments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sarcoidosis is a noncontagious systemic disease of unknown origin that causes inflamed, microscopic growths called granulomas that often affect one or more systems in the body, including the lungs, skin, eyes, and nervous system. This disease is sometimes difficult to diagnose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Lung Association reports that more than 90 percent of the people diagnosed with sarcoidosis experience some degree of problem with their lungs which may reduce their ability to absorb oxygen. Because of scarring caused by the inflammations, between 20 and 30 percent of people with pulmonary sarcoidosis end up with some degree of permanent lung damage. Although death is relatively uncommon, mortality can occur due to lung failure or if the disease causes serious damage to a vital  organ other than the lungs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been observed that the disease occurs throughout the world in all races and both sexes, although gender and ethnicity may have an impact on the risk of developing sarcoidosis and its severity. Women and people of African descent, along with those of Scandinavian, German, Irish and Puerto Rican descent, are particularly prone to the disease and its more chronic and serious manifestations. The reasons for this are yet unknown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cause or causes of sarcoidosis remain a mystery. Our best medical evidence to date has not discovered the extent to which lifestyle, environment, or heredity affects the development, severity, or length of this disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Lung Association reports that most researchers believe that the disease involves an altered immune system. Some studies suggest sarcoidosis is caused by a respiratory infection triggered by bacteria or a virus, or even by exposure to burning wood. Others suggest possible occupational or environmental risks. And some studies also show that sarcoidosis may run within families, suggesting a genetic link.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Medical science has developed treatments that manage the symptoms of the disease, but no treatment is clearly effective for a prolonged period, and there is no cure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Considering the broad reach of this disease, across people of different genders and ethnicities throughout the  world, and the lack of scientific evidence as to its cause or a cure, it is important to acknowledge the efforts of individuals and organizations to observe National Sarcoidosis Awareness Month and work on promoting awareness and the search for the cause and effective treatments. I am pleased, therefore, to stand in support of this resolution  and ask for a "yes" vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I was very pleased to be the sponsor of this resolution, and I want to commend and thank all of the sarcoidosis activists who have visited my office, who have called me, who have written letters and telegrams and e-mails urging that we do something to further promote and raise awareness around this illness. I am pleased we have this resolution on the floor today. I urge its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 1149, which expresses support for the designation of April 2008 as National Sarcoidosis Awareness Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that produces tiny lumps of cells called granulomas in the lungs, lymph nodes or skin. The cause of sarcoidosis is unclear, but it has been associated with exposures to organic and chemical dusts, metals, silica and wood dust or smoke.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that New York City Fire Fighters who responded to the World Trade Center collapses in the aftermath of 9/11 have markedly higher rates of sarcoidosis. In the year immediately following 9/11, there was a 6-fold increase from pre-9/11 levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's no doubt that many heroes of 9/11 are sick because of their exposure to Ground Zero toxins. Raising awareness of sarcoidosis and encouraging funding for research into the disease is one small way we can honor the heroes and heroines of 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Illinois for introducing this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
