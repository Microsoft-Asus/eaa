  <narrative>PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11720]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <chair> The gentlewoman will state her inquiry.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SCHULTZ, WASSERMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my understanding of the rule that you just cited is that Members need to refrain from making direct accusations of the President's being deceptive or referring to the President as a prevaricator or any other word that might apply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I did on the House floor this evening was read from a newspaper editorial's opinion. I did not directly make any reference. So I wanted to make sure that we clarify that that was not a violation of the rules.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentlewoman is incorrect. The House rules do not permit a Member to make an improper statement under the guise that it is a quote from another.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SCHULTZ, WASSERMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>I will take that under advisement, Mr. Speaker, but that is something that I would like to look into on my own and would be happy to follow up with the Parliamentarian. Thank you.</paragraph>
