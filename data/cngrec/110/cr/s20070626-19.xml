    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a colleague and a friend--someone whose presence is missed but whose legacy will undoubtedly endure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Craig Thomas was a westerner through and through. The story of his life reflects the spirit of the West--his work ethic, his strength of character, and his love for the land and resources of his cherished Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig's life lessons were formed as a summer horseback guide, as a competitive wrestler, as a marine, as a husband, and as a father. He brought those lessons with him to Washington, D.C., as a Congressman and a Senator, and he never forgot them or strayed from them. That is clear from the issues he held closest to his heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a fellow westerner, I always admired Craig's commitment to being an exemplary steward of our national parks. His love for them probably developed during his childhood summers around Yellowstone National Park, but he was able to translate that passion into monumental improvements that generations of Americans will enjoy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also worked tirelessly on issues impacting public land management, agriculture, rural healthcare, and fiscal responsibility--all issues that greatly benefited his constituents in Wyoming. And they understood and appreciated his advocacy for their well being by electing him time and again to represent them in the Nation's Capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig definitely had a special presence on Capitol Hill. He never gave up a fight; he had a certain grit that drew others to him; and he loved to joke around--all tributes that led to his being described as a cowboy or a Western hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The epitome of the American cowboy, John Wayne, has inscribed on his headstone: "Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. Comes into us at midnight very clean. It's perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes we've learnt something from yesterday."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig Thomas treated every "tomorrow" as a new and exciting opportunity to make a difference for the people of Wyoming and the United States. He loved his work; he loved his family; and he loved life. While he is no longer serving as the voice of the westerner in the Senate, his years of dedicated service ensured that his legacy will survive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig was a statesman and a leader, a fighter and a friend. The Thomas family, the people of Wyoming, and those of us who worked with Craig will always remember the spirit of Western freedom, trusted integrity, and heartfelt kindness that he embodied. We are all fortunate to have known such a remarkable person.</paragraph>
