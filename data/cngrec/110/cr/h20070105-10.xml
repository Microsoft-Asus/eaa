    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as Democrats take control of Congress this week, the American people are going to see some stark differences in how we run this institution compared to the way it has been run for the last 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the House is actually going to be in session 5 days a week most weeks. Last year, the Republican Congress was known as the do-nothing Congress because it met fewer days than any Congress in 6 decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only is this House going to be in session more often, it is actually going to do its job while we are here. For years, Republican Congresses refused to conduct proper oversight of the Bush administration, instead choosing to rubber-stamp its policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats take oversight responsibility seriously, and are prepared to hold this administration accountable for its successes and its failures. In hearings, we're going to ask administration officials some tough questions so that we can make government work again for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at a time when our Nation is at war and with so many domestic and international issues that must be addressed, the American people rightly want us here doing our job. The new Democratic Congress will not disappoint.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal note, as one of the new freshmen elected here, America, you have a great freshman class, a great deal of talent, and I think you can feel proud of your new Speaker, Madam PELOSI.</paragraph>
