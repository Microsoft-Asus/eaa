    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (<bill type="hr" number="130">H. Res. 130</bill>) congratulating the National Football League champion Indianapolis Colts for winning Super Bowl XLI and for bringing the City of Indianapolis and the State of Indiana their first Lombardi Trophy.</paragraph>

  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will defer my opening remarks, and first shall be first. And I am going to yield such time as she might consume to the first lady of Indiana, Representative Julia Carson, who is the sponsor of this resolution.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400067" topic="">
    <paragraph>I do thank you very much, Representative Davis, for your courtesy and your indulgence, especially being from Illinois, the Chicago Bears. And the Bears have been overcome by the Colts. If you watch the Animal Planet channel, you can see that the Colts are not to be pushed around. So I want to thank you very much for your courtesy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come to the floor today to join my colleague, Danny Burton. We have contiguous districts. I am fighting over mine because the Colts' headquarters and the team is in my district, but I am sure he doesn't mind that at all. I heard the wonderful remarks that he made yesterday about the Colts, about Tony Dungy and Bill Polian and Jim Irsay. I want to thank him for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come today to congratulate the Indianapolis Colts, who are in my district. See, we have good things in my district. They are not all drive-by shootings. The Indianapolis Colts have made us extremely proud. Here is a man, Tony Dungy, who incurred major tragedy, who hung out about a week or two, and then he came back and got back on the plate. I admired him for that. He sets an example for a lot of our young kids to follow that your setbacks can be your setups and your stumbling blocks can be  your stepping stones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tony Dungy was determined to lead. He lead in a very positive way. He could have stayed out, moaned and groaned about what had happened, but he didn't do that. He incurred his spirituality and kept on moving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I heard somebody mention the NASCAR a few minutes ago. We lost Paul Dana in NASCAR out in Indianapolis, and he fought successfully to get race cars to use ethanol. In 2008, all the race cars of NASCAR will be fired up and fueled up by ethanol. I want to be sure and mention that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to recognize the Indianapolis Colts, the Super Bowl champions. The path they took was not easy, but they made it look easy because they operated as a team. I think that is an illustration of what we can become if we operate in unison as a team. When one member faltered, two others would be there to fill the gap. And after a long season, they filled the gap on a rain-soaked field in Miami to claim the title of world champions. Tony Dungy, game MVP Peyton Manning and Robert Sanders  have all earned the title of champions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that Indianapolis was represented by a very classy team with character. In a day when so many athletes are questionable examples, this team shows that you can be an active citizen and a winner at the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a championship of firsts. This is the first Super Bowl win for the Indianapolis Colts, and the first time an African American head coach led the team to an NFL title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations, Indianapolis Colts, and team owner Jim Irsay and President Bill Polian and all those who have supported this team through the years. I want to thank Lovie Smith, class act; Chicago Bears; and all my friends in Chicago for a wonderful Super Bowl.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You go, Colts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back to Danny, and I won't take my district away from him right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Burton.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, there are a lot of reasons to thank Tony Dungy and Peyton Manning and the whole team for the great victory they had last Sunday. I sat in the rain for about 5 hours and watched them, and I didn't feel a drop of rain because they did such a great job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might have felt a drop of rain in the first part when Devin Hester ran 92 yards for the opening kickoff touchdown. It kind of scared everybody to death who were Colts fans, but we all had faith in Peyton Manning and the Colts, and we knew that they wouldn't give up, especially after watching them coming back from the biggest deficit in championship history to defeat New England 2 weeks before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the reason I want to thank them today is for my Illinois colleagues. I want Coach Dungy and Peyton Manning and the whole team to know, from my colleagues in Illinois, I want a deep-dish pizza, a pound of cheese cake and a bunch of DVDs for our troops over in Iraq. So I want to thank them very much for making sure I didn't have to pay for all that other stuff, but my colleague on the other side of the aisle does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be serious for just a moment. We are very, very thrilled to have a Super Bowl champion in Indianapolis, we waited for a long, long time. And it came at a time when we had some of the finest people that have ever been on a football team playing in Indianapolis. It came at a time when we had one of the finest coaches who ever coached football in Indianapolis. And not only is Tony Dungy a great coach, but he is a great American and a very patriotic man and a good Christian fellow. And everybody  in Indianapolis really respects him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peyton Manning has been a gentleman on and off the field. The whole team has. I can name everybody on the team. And I just want to say, on behalf of the Congress, me and Julia Carson, my colleague who represents Indianapolis, and Steve Buyer and others, that we are very, very proud of the Colts. We hope they bring us another Super Bowl next year, but even if they don't, we are very, very thrilled. They have done Indianapolis proud, and we are very proud to talk about them here  today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is obviously a bitter pill to swallow, especially given the fact that I represent the Chicago Bears, who happen to be in my district, the stadium that they use. We were anticipating great thrills and great delights, and for a brief moment we did, in fact, have that. But then someone said to me that we came in like lions and went out like lambs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I guess that is exactly what happened. This past Sunday, Tony Dungy and the Indianapolis Colts beat Lovie Smith and his Chicago Bears 29-17 in a wet Super Bowl XLI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The slippery conditions made for several muffs and miscues throughout the game, including a Romo-like botched hold during the extra point after the Colts' first touchdown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bears got off to a quick start with Devin Hester returning the opening kickoff for a TD, and Rex Grossman hitting Muhsin Muhammad with a 4-yard pass in the first quarter for another seven points.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After this the Bears' offense sort of fizzled, and the Colts took advantage with Peyton Manning leading several drives that ended in Adam Vinatieri's field goals and a TD pass to Reggie Wayne. Joseph Addai and Dominic Rhodes also both contributed some hard runs with a combined rushing total of 190 yards and a touchdown. On the other side of the ball, the Colts were the better defense, causing five turnovers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As noted last week, this game made history with two African American coaches facing each other for the title, and Tony Dungy being the first black coach to win a Super Bowl.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, I want to congratulate Coach Dungy on a job well done, and adding to the celebration of Black History Month. I also want to commend Peyton Manning for his leadership of the team. I want to thank Representative Carson's staff for their hard work, especially Kathleen Taylor, who did such a quick job of putting all of this together so that we did not have to delay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so with serious regret on the part of the Chicago Bears, I commend and congratulate the Indianapolis Colts and urge support for this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it sure is nice to hear the gentleman from Illinois extol the virtues of the Indianapolis Colts. I really appreciate that, Danny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very happy to yield to my colleague from Indiana, another great Colts fan, Congressman Steve Buyer, 2 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400056" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand here to honor the Indianapolis Colts and Super Bowl champions. The Colts are a team that I believe represent the best of professionalism and goodwill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My congratulations to Tony Dungy for his accomplishments in leading the  Colts to an overall season record of 16-4 and for becoming the first African American head coach to win a Super Bowl. I am most hopeful that such reference does not have to be made in the future. That is the goodness of America. Coach, you have also demonstrated that nice guys can win.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also commend the passionate Indianapolis Colts who braved single-digit temperatures to welcome back home for the first time to the city of Indianapolis and the State of Indiana the Vince Lombardi Trophy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I also learned something, though, that I think America should know about the Super Bowl. You see, the teams that actually play the Super Bowl actually get 17 percent of the tickets. Those tickets go to those fans of the two teams, and they are upper deck, end zone seats, which means that all of the prime seats of the Super Bowl go to all of the other owners. So what I am most hopeful is that America takes note here that actually the fans of the teams that get to play the Super Bowl  really do not get to see much of their team in a Super Bowl. And so what happens here is the city who wants a Super Bowl in their city, they trade seats for votes. And so it is like, hey, if I want the Super Bowl in Detroit, and you are the team owner in Detroit, I will give you 1,500 seats at the 35-yard line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the end of the first quarter with all of the rain, you had over 10,000 empty seats. You say, what happened to the fans? Well, those are people there who wanted to see a football game, but do not necessarily like to sit in the rain because they didn't like either team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we need to redo how they do the Super Bowl and actually sit the fans where they can enjoy the game. So hopefully that is taken into account.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Coach Dungy, the entire team, the owner Jim Irsay, the dedicated staff of the Colts organization and thousands of Colts fans, I offer my congratulations to the Colts for the Super Bowl victory over my father's beloved Chicago Bears. Go Colts.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, of course maybe the NFL could learn from the House and realize that there should be no trading of seats for votes, and that would make the disposition a bit different.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield 3 minutes to Representative Brad Ellsworth from Indiana.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412206" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my congratulations to the Super Bowl champions, the Indianapolis Colts. The NFL season came to a triumphant close Sunday night in Miami. But I am most proud that the Colts began their history run to this Super Bowl in Indiana's Eighth District last August on the training fields of Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Sunday, Coach Dungy, along with Lovie Smith of the Bears, became the first African American head coaches to walk the sidelines on the Super Bowl. As the clock expired and the scoreboard read 29 for the Colts and 17 for the Bears, a rain- and Gatorade-soaked Dungy made NFL history again by becoming the first African American to win the Lombardi Trophy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After a sloppy start in a rainy Miami that included a kickoff returned for a touchdown and an interception by the Bears, the Colts found themselves in an early hole. But the Dungy-led team refused to give up and charged back to take a 16-14 halftime lead, with Reggie Wayne and Dominic Rhodes providing touchdowns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Colts dominated the second half of the game on both sides of the ball, surrendering only three points while bolstering their lead. Cornerback Kelvin Hayden, who was playing in place of injured starter Nick Harper, put the game nearly out of reach in the fourth quarter when he intercepted Rex Grossman's pass and returned it for 56 yards for a touchdown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Safety Bob Sanders, who forced a fumble earlier in the game, clinched it on the ensuing drive with an interception of his own, and Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri, the NFL's all-time leader in career Super Bowl field goals, contributed the remainder of the team's scoring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to congratulate the Super Bowl MVP Peyton Manning. With his performance, Manning silenced all of the critics who throughout his career claimed that he could not win the big game. They do not get any bigger than this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Manning threw for 247 yards and a touchdown, while leading his team to victory. Manning was aided in the backfield by the two-pronged running attack of Rhodes and rookie Joe Addai, who combined to rush for 190 yards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Colts excelled on the field at the Super Bowl, but what makes it truly a pleasure to cheer for is the dignity and class the team displayed throughout the season. I believe that this starts at the top with Coach Dungy. Karen Crouse of the New York Times summed up the Colts' coach best when she wrote, and I quote, "Dungy has the most victories of any NFL coach since 1999 with a record of 90-38. But the bottom line is not what defines him. His life has been about opening people's eyes so they  may see talent and not skin color; spirituality and not celebrity; integrity and not self-interest. He has helped a lot of people see more clearly," and I could not agree more. Go Colts.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to another great Colts fan, Congressman Mike Pence.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. PENCE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise in this bipartisan gathering with thanks to the leadership of Congresswoman Julia Carson to congratulate the world champion Indianapolis Colts. I congratulate the gentlewoman from Indianapolis for her leadership on this resolution and its eloquent drafting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As others of my colleagues have suggested, the Colts' victory was not just a demonstration of athletic prowess, but it was a moment where I think the world got to see a little bit of Indiana on the world stage. They got to see the kind of serious work ethic, humility, commitment to getting the job done without a lot of flash and a lot of fanfare that really characterizes the people of Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Congressman Burton said, I also had the privilege, along with my wife Karen, of witnessing some history, not only the first world championship to come to Indianapolis, but also I saw the first African American coach lead a team to the Super Bowl, and to see two great teams led by two African American coaches shatter that glass ceiling, that for reasons of culture and habit had somehow been long established, in that stadium for that great championship game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, Mr. Speaker, it is said that attitude reflects leadership, and I believe that Coach Tony Dungy really personifies just the type of leadership that deserves rewarding in the NFL and is heralded in the State of Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say that Coach Dungy should be admired not only for that calm, steady leadership on the sidelines, but also his career off the field is equally impressive. Since his time in Tampa Bay, he brought his commitment to Christian values to young people through the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. He launched Mentors for Life, a program that provided tickets to young people for home games and their mentors. And I was there about a year ago when Coach Dungy, one of many such occasions around  the country, spoke in Anderson, Indiana, to a stadium full of young people about his profound faith in Christ and about his belief in the relationship of character to success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we also celebrate Peyton Manning, the man awarded with Most Valuable Player in the Super Bowl, and of course now a man who others have said has minted his reputation as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time. He personifies a humility and a work ethic that I believe are rightly celebrated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me close by saying, as Peyton Manning remarked on being selected MVP, he said, "I am excited, but I am proud to be on this team."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to close my remarks today by asking unanimous consent to add to the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record the names of all of the members of the Colts' offense, defense, substitutions and the coaching staff, because this truly was a team effort. It was men and women in the head offices, and on the fields, on the training staff, and the catching staff that brought this world championship home to our capital city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have our praise, our congratulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Offense: Reggie Wayne--Wide Receiver, Tarik Glenn--Offensive Tackle, Ryan Lilja--Offensive Guard, Jeff Saturday--Center, Jake Scott--Offensive Guard, Ryan Diem-- Offensive Tackle, Dallas Clark--Tight End, Marvin Harrison--Wide Receiver, Peyton Manning--Quarterback, Joseph Addai--Running Back, and Ben Utecht--Tight End.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Donnelly).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412205" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Congresswoman Carson on her resolution, to add my name to it, and to also say I come from a unique place, and that my district is not far from Chicago. Our beautiful district has numbers of Bears fans in it as well as Colts fans. And so to the Bears fans from Michigan City, Laporte, and South Bend, I say a season well done; one step short is still a heck of a year. We are incredibly proud of the Bears, but we are also beaming about our  world champion Indianapolis Colts who did it in a way to reflect what our State's values are: dignity, hard work, class, and a never-give-up attitude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Peyton Manning, to Joseph Addai, to all of the outstanding players, and especially to Coach Tony Dungy, Tony Dungy and Lovie Smith come from a long tradition of fine men like Sherm Lewis, men like Eddie Robinson, and to see Tony Dungy as the first African American coach to win the Super Bowl was a tremendous moment. But he will not be the last. There will be many, many more. But his name will be etched in history forever. And as a man, we can only look at Tony and hope that we can be as fine  in image and in value to our sons and daughters as he has been to all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hard work, nonstop class, I am proud to be from our beloved State and proud of our world championship Super Bowl champion Indianapolis Colts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>

  <speaking speaker="400055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to yield 3 minutes to another Colts fan who is a friend of Peyton Manning from Tennessee, the great Congressman from that State (ZACH WAMP).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400421" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and everyone from Illinois and Indiana for bringing us to this moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to represent the State of Tennessee in coming to congratulate the Indianapolis Colts. Few people would know this, but last Thursday here in Washington was our annual prayer breakfast, where we bring people from all around the world for our prayer breakfast. And Dr. Francis Collins of the Human Genome Project was the speaker, and he just did an extraordinary job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what people wouldn't know was that before we invited Dr. Francis Collins, we actually extended an invitation to Tony Dungy. But Tony Dungy knew when we extended that invitation where he was going to be the following Sunday, and he told us. Sorry, I can't come speak at the National Prayer Breakfast because I will be preparing to play in the Super Bowl. And boy, was he preparing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many people know the connections to Tennessee here with this Super Bowl because of Peyton Manning, because he played his college football at the University of Tennessee. And I dare say, other than the State of Indiana, and maybe Mississippi, the State of Tennessee was cheering for the Indianapolis Colts in greater numbers than any State in the Union because of Peyton Manning, because he is our favorite son because of where he played his college football.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To this very day, he owns real estate in Chattanooga. He plays his golf in Chattanooga. We see him a lot. He is married to a Chattanooga girl. We are very proud of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You wouldn't know also that R.V. Brown, who was the chaplain for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, is one of Coach Dungy's closest friends and the person to whom we extended the invitation. We are so very proud of these relationships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What about Lovie Smith? He coached at the University of Tennessee as well. So all of these great players and coaches that really represented the goodness of America on Sunday and in the days leading into Sunday have some kind of Tennessee connections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I just want to close with this thought. Proverbs 16:15 says this: Good-tempered leaders invigorate lives. They are like spring rain and sunshine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I have got to tell you that Tony Dungy and Lovie Smith are good-tempered leaders straight from that scripture. They have invigorated lives, and they refresh and give life to this great Nation. We honor them today because of their leadership. We honor this team because of what they stood for. And we are grateful, frankly, that this brings the country together and lifts us to a new level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations, Indianapolis Colts.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, now it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Indiana ( Mr. Hill).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400177" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I was in my office just a few minutes ago watching, doing my work in my office, but I caught my colleagues talking about the victorious Indianapolis Colts, and I couldn't resist coming down here. I don't have any prepared remarks, but I want to come to the floor today to also extend my congratulations to the Indianapolis Colts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife and my three daughters had the opportunity to see the Colts win the AFC championship at Indianapolis. And at the time, I thought it was good enough that we just made it to the Super Bowl. But that wasn't good enough for Peyton Manning and Marvin Harrison and the rest of the Colts and Tony Dungy. They wanted the ring. And they stepped up to the plate and took it to another level. And I watched in amazement how they held steady when the chips were down, especially when they were playing  against the Patriots, and how they held steady when the Chicago Bears scored that touchdown right off the bat. They didn't panic. They showed true leadership, and I am so proud of the Colts, and I am proud of the fact that I had the opportunity to extend congratulations to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think Marvin Harrison and Peyton Manning are the best one-two punch in the history of the NFL. These two players are magnificent athletes, but they are also magnificent human beings in who they are and how they lead. And I couldn't be more happy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also have to say something about the Chicago Bears. They are a great football team. We beat a great football team. And Rex Grossman, who is the quarterback of that team, has caught a lot of heat recently for what he did. But he took the Chicago Bears to the Super Bowl, and that is a feat in itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I single him out because I believe it was his dad or his uncle that I actually played football against in Bloomington, Indiana, where Rex Grossman actually is. So I consider him a constituent. Bloomington is in my district. It is great to applaud him for his accomplishments. I applaud the Chicago Bears, and I applaud the Indianapolis Colts for all the good things that they have done for the State of Indiana.</paragraph>

But I just want to say to my colleagues from Illinois, and I say this in a good-natured way, if you need a Colts hat, I just happen to have a few in my office. I will be very happy to buy you one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I still want my deep-dish pizza, my cheesecake, and I want to make sure those DVDs get to the troops in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, to close, I will just simply say that, of course, Eli's has the best cheesecake in the world, and Representative Burton, you shall be able to partake of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But also, let me say that we will congratulate all of the players, all of the owners, all of those who made these two great teams. I have never seen two men who have given more to a sport than Tony Dungy and Lovie Smith. Not only are they masters of the game, not only are they great coaches and leaders, but they exemplify the best of human beings, the best that you could possibly be, and that is what they have done for the game of football. That is what they have done for America. And I am sure  that Americans all over the Nation will be cheering them on for years and years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to Representative Julia Carson for the last word.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400067" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that all of the delegation of Indiana has come to the floor to speak on behalf of this worthy resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tony Dungy, if you don't mind, I will single him out, exhibits the kind of character that we would all like our men to exhibit. Young men, who were jumping up and down at the Colts Super Bowl, can learn so much about how far you get in this world by displaying strength, by displaying honesty and integrity and loving the Lord. That is what Tony Dungy does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He belongs to Northside New Era Church in Indianapolis, which is a little church on a hill. It is not a big, palatial church that swings around city blocks; just a little church on a hill. And the members there love him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I notice that he took many of the young people from Northside New Era to Miami, which was an experience that they will never replicate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to thank the Dungy family. His wife, when the church has an event, she is right there with her little apron on cooking, too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it shows you that you can't think too highly of yourself. And Tony Dungy certainly doesn't do that. He thinks highly of the Lord and of all the people that he serves. And I am just happy that I lived long enough to see this major event happen on behalf of the district that I represent.</paragraph>
