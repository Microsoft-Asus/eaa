    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend Southwest Airlines and their 30 years of service to the Permian Basin. For the past three decades, Southwest Airlines has provided friendly and affordable air services in and out of Midland International Airport. With over 13 daily departures to six cities in three States, the people of the Permian Basin are free to move about the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On my many flights on Southwest Airlines, I am always struck by the friendly, good natured flight attendants, agents and pilots that make up the employees of this airline. There is an unmistakable sense of pride that comes with working with Southwest that can be seen in the faces of the pilots to the ground crew.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to represent the many employees of Southwest Airlines that are headquartered at Midland International Airport and look forward to 30 more years of friendly and accommodating service.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
