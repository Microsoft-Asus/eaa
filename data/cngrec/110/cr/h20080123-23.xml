  <speaking speaker="400176" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today's economic debate should focus on big picture tax policies that emphasize sustained prosperity for American workers and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A one-time, consumption-driven stimulus may be popular, but what we really need is tax relief that will energize economic growth. We need certainty for our industry which is currently making tomorrow's business plans today based on the assumption that taxes are going to increase dramatically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should also reduce tax rates on our companies from the highest tax rates in the world to instead placing American employers on an even tax footing globally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today's economy didn't happen overnight, and tomorrow's growth and prosperity will depend on our commitment to bold, forward-looking tax policies now.</paragraph>
