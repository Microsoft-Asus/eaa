  <narrative>BRINGING ECONOMIC SECURITY TO WORKING FAMILIES -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H29]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400384" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today, I rise to express my strong concern about the fiscal crisis that we are facing here in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The subprime mortgage crisis has directly impacted millions of American homeowners, particularly in my own district in the San Gabriel Valley. As the chart shows, nearly 650 families in my district somewhere lost their homes to foreclosure. In Los Angeles alone, a family loses their home every hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nationally, unemployment rates have risen above 5 percent. Half of my district has a rate above 5 percent. In East Los Angeles, it is upwards of 7.2 percent. Other economic indicators are showing signs of an economic slowdown, including a sharp decline in consumer spending and the largest annual increase in wholesale prices in 26 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I am proud that this House has passed billions to provide relief for middle-income Americans and small businesses and increased the minimum wage, we still have to do more. I look forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle to bring economic security back to the working families, not only in my district, but across this country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
