  <speaking speaker="400108" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Staff Sergeant Lillian Clamens, who was killed in Iraq on October 10, 2 days before she was scheduled to come home, when insurgents launched a rocket attack on her unit. I want to extend my deepest condolences to her husband, Raymond, her three children, Victoria, Alana, and Ayinde, her parents and all of her family and friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Staff Sergeant Clamens was a true American patriot devoted to her family and her country. She served in the Army Reserve for more than 15 years and was assigned to the 1st Postal Platoon, 834th Adjutant General Company, in Miami. Prior to her deployment, she worked as an administrative clerk at the U.S. Southern Command in Doral.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She exemplified the best our Nation has to offer: a loving mother of three children, a devoted wife, and a soldier selflessly committed to serving our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, her life will continue to inspire all those who knew her and many who frankly did not know her. The United States and our world is a far better place because of her service. The best way to honor her is to replicate her devotion to her country and her family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She gave the ultimate sacrifice to help defend our freedoms and advance liberty for so many others. She was a true American hero whose dedication to freedom and family, Madam Speaker, made a difference in this world. I join all Americans in expressing my deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Staff Sergeant Lillian Clamens. Her commitment to, and sacrifice for, our great Nation will never be forgotten. She has the deepest gratitude and devotion of our Nation.</paragraph>
