    <paragraph>Mr. President, under an order entered last night, this morning we will immediately proceed to executive session to consider the Petraeus nomination. We will have 45 minutes of debate on that nomination. Senator Levin will control half of the time, and the other half of the time is under the control of the Republican leader or his designee. A vote on the confirmation will occur around 9:45 this morning. The vote on the nomination will be the only vote today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As previously announced, there will be no rollcall votes Monday, January 29. There will be no votes the following Friday, a week from today, because the Republicans are having a retreat. We had ours earlier this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After we dispose of the nomination, we will return to <bill type="h" number="2">H.R. 2</bill>. A lot of work was done yesterday. We voted on eight amendments.</paragraph>
