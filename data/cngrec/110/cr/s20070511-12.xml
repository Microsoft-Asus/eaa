    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="1495">H.R. 1495</bill> now be agreed to; that on Monday, May 14, at 3 p.m., the Senate begin consideration of the measure and the majority manager, Senator Boxer, then be recognized to offer an amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I could withhold that, Mr. President, and note the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, as happens so much, a lot of times it appears that we are not doing anything, but the work done this morning off the Senate floor has been invaluable. The distinguished Republican leader and I have had a number of conversations; the last one took place just a few minutes ago here on the Senate floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I indicated in my prepared remarks today, there are a number of Senators, Democrats and Republicans, trying to work something out on immigration. Over the last week or so, they have taken a step forward and three-quarters of a step backward. Progress is being made, but it has been incremental, and it has been slow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the Senators believe there is a breakthrough that could take place, but they need all day on Tuesday to do that. Staff is going to be working over the weekend with some Senators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, reluctantly, but I think in anticipation of the greater good, the Republican leader and I have agreed it would be in the best interests of the Senate to put the cloture over on the immigration motion to proceed until Wednesday morning. Therefore, I will file cloture on Monday on the motion to proceed on immigration--not today.</paragraph>
