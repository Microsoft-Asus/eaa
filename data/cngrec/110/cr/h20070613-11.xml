  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last year House Republicans acted to stop the flow of illegal aliens into our country by passing five bills specifically addressing the current border crisis. Among these bills was the Secure Fence Act, a bill that among other things authorized more than 700 miles of two-layered reinforced fencing along the southwest border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, this week, as the House considers the Democrat Homeland Security Appropriations bill, we find that included in this legislation is a provision allowing localities to "shut off" funding for this vital border fence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the debate regarding our immigration system continues to wage on, one thing we know for certain is that controlling our borders should come first to any effort we undertake. We welcome legal immigrants who follow the rule of law. But it is unfortunate Democrats are backtracking on the progress we have made. It is time to fund the fence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
