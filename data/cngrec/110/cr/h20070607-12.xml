  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, what do Ozzy Osbourne concert tickets, strip clubs, Las Vegas casinos, and expensive jewelry have in common?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you think it sounds like a bachelor party itinerary, you will be surprised to learn it actually is a sampling of purchases made and places visited by Federal employees while using their government-issued credit cards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What began as an efficient method for tracking and reimbursing legitimate expenses has morphed into an unmonitored system that can lend itself to abuse and fraud. For these reasons, Senator Grassley and I have reintroduced the Government Credit Card Prevention Act. This bill provides for necessary oversight, including credit checks and periodic audits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American taxpayers will not stand for this continued abuse and lack of oversight. Enactment of this legislation is crucial to promote fiscal responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
