  <narrative>HOUSE RULES ON TAX RATE INCREASES -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10907]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400291" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm honored to serve as chairman of the Select Revenue Measures Subcommittee. That subcommittee reviews tax legislation that has been referred to the Ways and Means Committee. We take this responsibility most seriously. Raising or lowering the tax burden on families and businesses has a real impact, both on those individuals and on the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was concerned when I heard debate last week suggesting that the House had changed our procedural rules for considering tax increases. The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price) mistakenly stated that the House rules no longer require a supermajority for tax rate increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House rules on this subject are exactly the same as they were under the last Congress. The rule was written by the Republican majority back in 1997 and has remained unchanged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I simply wanted to ensure that the record was entirely clear on this subject.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
