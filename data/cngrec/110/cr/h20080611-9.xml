  <narrative>WHERE IS THE MAJORITY'S ENERGY PLAN? -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5218]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, what is the deal? Lately when I've been in South Carolina, I have been talking to a lot of frustrated folks. And they are frustrated because they are watching their hard-earned paychecks burn up in their gas tanks. And I'm frustrated because I know there is no energy plan to help these families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two years ago the Democrats said they would introduce a commonsense plan to help the energy crisis. And today, when the Americans need it most, when they're paying $4 a gallon for gas, there is no energy plan. Yet I stand here today week after week, as I am doing, asking my friends on the Democrat side, "Where is the plan?" I have only seen plan 1, and that has been drafted by the Republican party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Are my Democrat colleagues not hearing the pleas of the American public about high gas prices? Do they not travel to their respective districts and talk to their citizens? Have they not heard the public's frustration? Or do they choose to ignore them?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Members of Congress, it is our duty to solve the problem. And it is just not good enough to tell them, "We have no plan."</paragraph>
