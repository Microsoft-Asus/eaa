    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, just moments ago, this body voted to pay an appropriate tribute to a dedicated public servant in New York's 19th Congressional District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 10, 2007, the Hudson Valley lost one of its most involved leaders when E. Arthur Gray, a former five-term mayor of Port Jervis and New York State Senator, passed away at the age of 82 years old. He left behind a legacy of friendship, involvement and service that earned him a permanent place in the heart of Port Jervis and serves as an example of what it means to work for the betterment of your community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By voting to pass legislation that would redesignate the post office in Port Jervis, New York, as the E. Arthur Gray Post Office Building, the House has acknowledged the contributions of an individual who loved his hometown and who, as a businessman, government official and family man, dedicated a significant portion of his time and energy to its civic life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, Arthur Gray was a Port Jervis resident to the core: born February 28, 1925, in Port Jervis, a graduate of Port Jervis High School before leaving briefly for college, only to return as president and co-owner of the Gray-Parker Funeral Home in his native Port Jervis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Art Gray's participation in public life extended to government service. He was mayor of Port Jervis from 1978 to 1988. A lifetime resident of Port Jervis, Gray gave his undivided attention to issues, both large and small, and was widely known for his open-door policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Art Gray remains the longest-serving mayor in the history of Port Jervis. During his tenure he was able to reinvigorate the downtown area and greatly improve the city's economic development plan. Citizens of the local area remember Art as a man who was generous in nature and willing to help those in need. After finishing his service as mayor, Art Gray maintained his commitment to public service by successfully running for a seat in the New York State senate in 1988.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He represented the 39th Senatorial District in that capacity until 1990. But E. Arthur Gray's contributions to his city and his country were not limited to business and politics. He served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Naval Reserve during World War II. He was also deeply involved in community life, and the list of organizations that count him as a member is astounding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At one time or another, Art Gray was a member of the Port Jervis Community Development Agency, the Orange County Economic Development Agency, the National League of Small Cities Advisory Council, St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, Bon Secours Community Hospital Advisory Board, Knights of Columbus Council No. 471, Ancient Order of Hibernians in America, Elks Lodge No. 645, BPOE, Port Jervis Lions Club, Tri-States Chamber of Commerce, Port Jervis Country Club, Metaque Falls Hunting Club, Tri-States  Rod and Gun Club, the Port Jervis Board of Education, and Port Jervis Planning Board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you look at that list, you gain a true appreciation for how much time, energy, and dedication Art Gray devoted to betterment of his hometown. However, he devoted just as much, if not more, to his family and friends. He was extremely devoted to his wife, Helen; son, Gerald; daughter, Brigid; and numerous other family members and close friends. He is remembered by those closest to him as enthusiastic, optimistic, supporting, loving, and inspirational.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through it all, E. Arthur Gray's life was deeply interwoven with the fabric of Port Jervis, his home, and it is fitting that the adoption of this bill will help memorialize his service.</paragraph>
