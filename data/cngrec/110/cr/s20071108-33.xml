    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss of U.S. Marine Corps 2LT Seth Pierce of Lincoln, NE. Lieutenant Pierce died on October 21 from injuries he sustained in an automobile accident on base at Quantico, VA, where he was stationed. He was 23 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lieutenant Pierce graduated from Lincoln Southeast High School in 2002, where he led the relay team to a State championship in 2001. After graduating from Arizona State University in 2006, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the U.S. Marine Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of Nebraska is proud of Lieutenant Pierce's service to our country, as well as that of the thousands of brave men and women serving in the U.S. Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lieutenant Pierce is remembered as a devoted son, brother, and grandson. He is survived by his parents Larry and Linda; his brother Aaron, and his grandparents, Edwin and Ruth Steffens, and Luther and Esther Pierce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring 2LT Seth Pierce.</paragraph>
