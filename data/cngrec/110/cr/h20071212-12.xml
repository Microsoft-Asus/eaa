  <narrative>AMERICAN FAMILIES NEED REAL LEADERSHIP FROM CONGRESS, NOT MORE POLITICS -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H15321]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. BOUSTANY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>This week, the Democratic leadership will unveil a half-trillion-dollar spending bill because they are unable to complete their constitutional responsibility. This half-trillion-dollar spending bill follows a failed energy bill that did nothing to increase our domestic supply of energy and failure to come up with a new farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Families across America are paying higher energy costs, they're bearing the burden of higher costs of living, and they are paying more for their health care. We in Congress have a responsibility to them. Furthermore, the Treasury Department waits now to see if Democrats will tax millions of Americans with the AMT, with their so-called AMT fix.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people want results, not politics. Let's finish the farm bill to provide some stability to our food producers and an energy bill to address the uncertainty and fluctuating prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, let's be diligent with Americans' hard-earned money with responsible spending. Let's put politics aside, let's get our work done, and let's give American families the results which they can be proud of.</paragraph>
