  <speaking speaker="400157" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor one of the bravest and most dedicated young heroes of north Texas and of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Army Private Clarence Spencer was killed in Bilad, Iraq while fighting against enemy forces in one of the most important conflicts our Nation has ever engaged in. Clarence Spencer gallantly and selflessly gave his life for his country while fighting alongside his fellow soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Division of Fort Hood, Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Private Spencer is survived by his mother and son and his loving wife, Army Private Charlotte Spencer, who has also devoted herself to our Nation's noble military profession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clarence Spencer served three tours in Iraq, two of which were as a marine. Wounded in Iraq on a previous tour, he demonstrated tremendous courage by deploying into harm's way once again. Private Clarence Spencer is gone, but he will never be forgotten. His memory lives in our hearts, and America is eternally grateful for his spirit and his dedication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Clarence's Dunbar High School football coach said about Clarence, "I have coached faster, stronger and more talented students, but I've never coached anyone I was more proud of." That is precisely the way that the Fort Worth community and our Nation feel about soldiers such as Private Clarence Spencer, a true American hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I also rise to honor a second hero of the Fort Worth community and of our Nation. A graduate of Fort Worth's Eastern Hills High School, Sergeant First Class Allan Mosteiro was an 18-year veteran of the Army, who was assigned as a scout leader in the 1st Cavalry Division based at Fort Hood, Texas. He gallantly and selflessly gave his life for his country as a result of wounds he received during a fire fight against enemy forces in Taji, Iraq on February 13, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Mosteiro is survived by his loving wife, son, parents, one brother and three sisters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people recognize their sacrifice and honor the Mosteiro family's patriotism. As a career soldier and senior noncommissioned officer, Sergeant Mosteiro's leadership was instrumental in developing younger soldiers, and he did not take his responsibility lightly. A veteran of Operation Desert Storm and of the current war, Allan Mosteiro dedicated his life to securing the freedoms that all Americans so rightfully cherish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant First Class Allan Mosteiro is gone, but he will never be forgotten. His memory lives on through the wonderful family that he left behind and the dedicated soldiers he so ably led.</paragraph>
