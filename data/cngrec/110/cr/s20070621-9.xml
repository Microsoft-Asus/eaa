  <chair> Will the Senator suspend to allow the Senate to report pending business.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, resuming debate on the amendment which I offered, the amendment is very straightforward. It simply says that notwithstanding the tax increases, $28.6 billion in tax increases in the amendment pending on the floor, they shall not take effect unless the Secretary of Energy certifies that those tax increases will not increase retail gasoline prices or the reliance of the United States on foreign sources of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The point of the amendment is to make it clear that sometimes tax increases on business can be passed on to consumers. If that happens in this case, we are going to see higher gasoline prices at the pump, not lower prices. One of the concerns many of us have with the underlying bill is it doesn't produce any new energy. Yet it spends $28.5 billion. To make up for that spending, it taxes an additional $28.6 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Somebody has to end up paying that tax. Most people in America know that when you put a tax on a business, that gets passed on to the consumers who buy the product--in this case, gasoline. So instead of reducing gasoline prices, this bill, if the underlying amendment passes, is going to add to the cost of gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday I mentioned a Heritage Foundation study that confirmed that what I was saying was not simply my opinion but the facts as a result of a study that the Heritage Foundation had done. I would like to expand on that a little bit because we actually have the figures for two States, the State of the chairman of the committee, Montana, and my State of Arizona, to illustrate the point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The study projects that gas prices in Montana, for example, in May averaged at $3.17 per gallon. They would be $3.48 per gallon next year as a result of the Energy bill before the Senate. A Montana taxpayer would see spending on gasoline increase by $1,632.95 next year, as a result of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Arizona, we are paying about $3.09 per gallon. That would go up to $3.40 next year as a result of this bill, so Arizona taxpayers will see spending on gasoline increase by $1,140.51 next year as a result of this Energy bill. That is a huge increase in consumers' payment for gasoline. When we realize that for many people driving is not a luxury, it is a requirement--to get to work or perform work--it is clear we are costing the American consumer a huge amount of money that is important for  our economy and for them to make a living. That is an unintended consequence of the tax increases embodied in this bill but real nevertheless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are saying is, if that is the result of tax increases, then those tax increases would not go into effect. I think that is an important principle for us to establish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to respond to a couple of points made by opponents of my amendment. The chairman of the Finance Committee argued the tax increases in the underlying bill are simply loophole closers, but that is not true. The largest tax increase in the bill is a brandnew tax. It is not a loophole closer, it is a new 13-percent tax on new oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. How is that going to help bring down gasoline prices? I suggest it is not. It will help to raise prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second largest tax increase in the bill raises the corporate tax rate. That is not a loophole closer either, it is simply needed to pay for the other costs of the bill, so it was a ready source of revenue that they decided to tap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a raise in the corporate tax rate for oil and gas companies, which would then make it higher on those companies than others in manufacturing--something we were trying to promote when we passed the bill 2 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Raising the corporate tax rate is obviously not a loophole closer. I suggest when you raise marginal tax rates, you either get less production or higher prices--more likely, both--not good results from raising taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the Senator from Oregon argued yesterday that with oil over $55 a barrel, oil companies should not need incentives to drill for new oil and gas. I certainly agree with that; they do not need any new incentives to drill for oil and gas. I have always been against those kinds of targeted incentives or taxpayer subsidies for any form of energy. But imposing a new tax or raising the corporate rate is not the same thing as repealing targeted incentives, which is what we should be doing. Moreover,  with oil over $60 a barrel right now, renewable energy companies should not need any further taxpayer subsidies either. The market is providing all the incentives necessary to produce hybrid cars and advanced fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These tax increases are not necessary. They are going to be counterproductive to our economic growth. They are going to hurt our producers vis-a-vis foreign producers, they are going to further increase our dependence on foreign oil and, most importantly, they are going to raise the cost of gasoline at the pump for American consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All my amendment says is if that happens, then these tax increases should not go into effect. If it doesn't have that effect, then the tax increases would go into effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the remainder of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from New Mexico.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Baucus amendment and urge my colleagues to vote against cloture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are only two things wrong with the Baucus amendment: One, it raises taxes in the wrong places; and, secondly, it spends these taxes on the wrong policies. I want to make two points upfront before I start my remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we speak of American big oil, let me remind people that America's five big oil companies hold less reserves than Hugo Chavez, the state-owned company of Hugo Chavez in his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My second point is, very seldom does the United States tax businesses that are in competition overseas. Let me repeat that. We in America hardly ever tax American businesses that are in competition overseas. Of course, that is exactly what we have done here, and what is going to happen is not going to be good. It is not going to help the American consumer one bit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are only two things, as I indicated, that are wrong with the Baucus amendment. I would repeat: It raises taxes in the wrong places, and then it spends them on the wrong policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cast this vote, and I think it is an informed vote based on my experience. It is with a deep sense of responsibility to do what is right, with a keen interest and understanding of energy policy, because I have been forced to work on it with many who know a lot about it. With a real appreciation of the importance of this vote, I will oppose cloture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tax provisions in this bill will increase the cost of gasoline at the pump for Americans, increase electricity bills for families, and work severe hardship on our natural gas supply. Additionally, this amendment could seriously harm our economy. The Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, recently noted that: A significant increase in energy prices can simultaneously slow the economy, and raise inflation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot vote for that consequence. I urge that my colleagues not do so either. I do not cast this vote lightly, and I arrive at the decision after a great deal of reflection. There are many good and important provisions contained in this amendment. In the area of renewable energy, while there may be questions about how long certain tax credits should be extended, there should be no doubt that in the past I have supported renewable energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Energy Policy Act of 2005, with Senator Bingaman, we passed the largest tax incentives for renewable energy, a variety of renewable energies, than we ever have in American history. My friend and colleague Senator Alexander has often referred to the bill that we passed as the "Clean Energy Act." He is right. In 2005, in the Energy Policy Act we provided renewable energy production tax credits, automobile tax credits, and we can keep going. We provided tax credits for  energy efficient improvements, biodiesel, and for ethanol. We included tax credits for installing alternative refueling property, tax credits for the installation of solar. The world demanded cleaner energy, and the Energy Policy Act answered the call.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Between 2004 and 2006, global private capital investment in clean energy rose from around $30 billion to $60 billion a year. It rose because we set the framework into law, and it was invested on the private side. In the public market and in venture capital and in private equity, in corporate research, development, and demonstration, and government research and development and asset financing, the answer has been the same. Both the private and public sector are excited about the future of clean  energy, and they are busy, under our 2005 act, investing heavily in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The weakness is in the amendment I am talking about. Without question, some of the tax incentives in this bill could have a positive impact on the landscape of American energy future. To deny that would be to debate unfairly the merits of this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cellulosic ethanol production credits, plug-in hybrid vehicle credits, and clean coal energy bonds are smart financial incentives, and those tax policies complement many of the goals we have sought to achieve in the previous legislation. I think that is good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Supporting the great things that we accomplished together in the Energy bill 2 years ago made us all feel good. However, the tax incentives in this bill focus on too narrow a field of energy policy. The Finance Committee has reported this amendment with a pricetag of $32.1 billion, a very large tax increase. In a few minutes I will speak about the troubling revenue-raising proposals in this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, first, I ask myself and I ask others, so our people would get a feeling of what $32.1 billion is, what it can be better used for or what it might be used for in the American economy if it were free to be invested or other things bought with it: $32.1 billion would purchase 15  biorefineries, 16,000 barrels-per-day coal-to-liquid refineries, 5 gasoline refineries, and 4 nuclear powerplants, 10 bio-energy research centers, and 500 miles of transmission lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I am not suggesting we would buy them with this bill, but I am suggesting that everyone should know the huge size of this tax, taken out of the economy, and what it would invest in similar dollars, that it could invest in the American economy. I just told you what they were.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could use this money for commercial demonstrations in oil shale, fund demonstrations for energy from coal using IGCC, and we all know we must do that. We do not have any money to do them, and we are having difficulty getting loans from the Government, and here we are taking $32 billion and not providing anything for these kinds of investments that we must do if we are going to keep pace with China, which is going full speed ahead with all of those things, including nuclear power, and nuclear  powerplants in this country. We must get there also.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in the meantime, we are taking an awful lot of revenue flow out of the economy, right away from the energy companies that know how to invest it, where to invest it, how to pick up reserves, and how to keep the price of oil as much within bounds as the world market will permit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without question, the revenue-raising proposals in the amendment will increases the cost of exploring for and producing our Nation's oil and gas and natural gas. As a result, Americans will pay higher prices for gasoline at the pump, and we will suffer increased electricity costs as our Nation's natural gas supply is weakened. We will pay higher prices, obviously, for natural gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The excise tax on oil and gas exploration increases taxes $10 billion over 10 years on producers on our Nation's Outer Continental Shelf. Frankly, I believe that entire tax is wrong. We should not be taxing the most productive--the places where more money is being put for exploration than anywhere else, the Outer Continental  Shelf. Yet one-third of the taxes here come from imposing a fee, a very high fee, on the Outer Continental Shelf. Who would have  thought it? The place in America where we have a chance of producing, we have imposed a heavy tax. Proponents of this amendment claim these tax provisions only affect the five largest U.S. oil and gas companies. Not true. But I have already told you who they are and what they represent in the world markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, there are 40 lessee companies. Nearly 75 percent of all entities leasing on the OCS hold leases that would be subject to a 13-percent punitive tax. I hardly thought I would see that on the floor of the Senate. Yet here it is, bragged about as a very big source of money that we can do other things with, without regard to the prices the American people are going to pay in the increased prices for oil and gas coming from the shelf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the lifeblood of our domestic oil and gas production. It makes absolutely no sense to advocate for independence from foreign oil, and then turn right around and raise taxes on our domestic companies that are producing America's oil and natural gas. It will mean higher prices for consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oil and gas production in the Outer Continental Shelf amounts to approximately 1.7 million barrels of oil per day, and 12 1/2  billion cubic feet of natural gas. Annually, this production equals approximately 600 million barrels of oil per year and 4.7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas per year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, that is good. They are doing fine. So why don't we put a tax on them of 13.5 surtax? It makes no sense. The price will go up, production will come down. These amounts produce 30 percent of our domestic oil production per year, and 23 percent of our domestic natural gas. Placing a punitive tax on this production is serious business backed by very serious facts, and I say serious consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Activities on the OCS provide an average of over $6 billion a year in revenue to the Treasury. In the future the offshore will be even more important. The Minerals Management Service estimates about 60 percent of the oil and 40 percent of the natural gas resources estimated to be contained in remaining undiscovered fields in the United States are located where? Where might you guess? In the Outer Continental Shelf, upon which we are going to place a very stiff, very high tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the intent of the OCS excise tax and the effect of this tax is crystal clear. The provision charges 13 percent of the removal price of taxable crude oil and natural gas, with a credit available to those who have price thresholds on their oil and natural gas leases. In plain English, this amendment seeks to legislatively breach valid contracts from 1998 and 1999, because the Clinton administration failed to include a term in these agreements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, there was no fault of the companies. The Clinton administration either made a mistake or did not want to put the fee on; it just didn't happen. So for those 2 years, we have royalty leases with no royalty thresholds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress cannot rewrite contracts after the fact merely because we do not like the contracts or the results. I predict when we are all finished, the courts of the land are going to say: This part of this tax is illegal and unconstitutional, and out the window will go a very large portion of this tax because the rights are clearly there. We have to think about it and think about what we are doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not like the idea of the United States of America going back on its contracts. It sounds and looks and smells like some foreign country. But we are close to doing it here in the name of some new answer, and at the same time saying it is going to yield revenues for us to use for various things in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we consider this amendment, the Senate should be on notice that legal precedent would not be on our side. The U.S. Supreme Court and Federal circuit court precedents suggest that the Government cannot avoid the obligations of its contracts by using its taxing power to take back benefits it has given up pursuant to an agreement. I suggest to the Senate that a Federal court will recognize this tax for what it is and, therefore, this $10 billion we are counting on in this bill will be lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of the Interior has already testified before Congress  expressing its concern about protracted litigation over this issue and the potential for a loss of billions in revenue as well as the delay of oil and gas production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are 2 other provisions among the revenue raising proposals that are very troubling. One provision would amend the Job Creation Act of 2004, which created tax relief for more than 200,000 U.S. corporations and businesses. This proposal increases taxes by almost $10 billion over 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of the Jobs Creation Act, we could call this provision the Jobs Destruction Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the increase in taxes by the U.S. Government on American companies competing overseas--through the foreign oil tax provision--increases taxes $3.1 billion over 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment also attacks American interests and cedes control to foreign interests. It says we would rather buy energy from the likes of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela than produce it ourselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To put the proper context on this, Saudi Aramco, the Saudi Arabian state-owned oil company, has nearly 3 times more daily output per million barrels per day than the largest U.S. oil company and holds nearly 10 times the oil and natural gas reserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To make it more difficult for American companies to compete overseas for this global commodity at a time when oil prices are nearly $70 per barrel is simply wrong. The Senate should reject this political expediency that will hurt American businesses, and the American consumer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I began my remarks by conveying to this Senate the seriousness with which I cast this vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my judgment, this amendment will have significant negative consequences on America's energy security. The Baucus amendment will increase the cost of producing oil and gas in America and will undermine the ability of American businesses to compete against state-owned oil companies run by foreign governments. The result for our Nation will be a greater reliance on crude oil from hostile regions of the world and an increase in the price of gasoline for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is an unacceptable consequence and not what the American people expect of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the reasons that I have stated, I must vote no on the motion to invoke cloture on the Baucus amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>How much time remains?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Eight minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300029" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come to the floor to oppose the tax that has been proposed and is now before us brought by the Finance Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very easy politically to stick it to the big boys, and that is the political game which is being played out on the floor of the Senate as we speak. Stick it to the big boys. OK, we are going to stick it to the big boys, $32.1 billion worth of taxes. What will it do for us? Will it change the price at the gas pump today? No. In fact, we have just heard the Senator from New Mexico say it could possibly raise the price of gas in the long term. Hasn't this Senate heard the plea of the American  consumer over the last 6 months about $3 gas? Don't we get it today or do we just want to play petrol politics? That is what the Finance Committee has done; they have played petrol politics. They are sticking it to the big boys, and they are going to put it in the green machine. The green machine may yield some energy in the future, but it sure isn't going to change the price at the gas pump tomorrow</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me show you the petrol politics of the real issue. Here is where the reserves in the world exist today. Here are the big boys of America--Exxon,  Chevron, Marathon. Do we really think if we stick it to these three and more we will change the world? No. The world today from the standpoint of energy is controlled over here on the left-hand side of the chart. It is controlled by Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and so on down the line. They control the known  reserves. They control the world's oil supply. They are the big boys. We are not sticking it to them. In fact, we are handing them a golden leaf. We are saying: You control the world oil supply, and we are dependent upon you for 60 percent of our supply. But we are going to penalize our producers because of the petrol politics of this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is another petrol game being played out. Petrol politics is being played out on the floor of the Senate, but petrol nationalism is being played out by these companies and countries of known reserve. Every one of these producers controls their supply; their nation's government and their nation's government's companies control the supply of oil. They can turn the valve on or off. Every time they do, the American consumer ultimately pays more. That is called petrol nationalism. I believe when  we talk about the war of energy today, that is what we are involved in. We are involved in a war on who can produce energy and can we become energy secure so that we don't have to be dependent upon Saudi Arabia and Iraq and Iran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know what is happening in that area of the world today, the phenomenal instability. Not only do these nations play petrol nationalism, they also play with something else: They have the weapon of mass disruption. Let me repeat that. These nations hold the weapon of mass disruption. You change the price at the pump a couple of dollars because you turn the valve off in these countries, and you hit this economy like a freight train.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What are we going to do today? We are going to tax it a little more. That is all this Congress really knows how to do, is tax. They don't know how to produce. We don't produce. We get out of the way of production. We encourage production, but this bill will not produce one barrel of oil. ExxonMobil will produce a barrel of oil. Chevron will. Marathon will. The rest of these countries will. But we don't. We are now stepping in the way of that production. We are now penalizing that production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The senior Senator from New Mexico talked about where the greatest reserves of America lie today--offshore. Yet we are saying: If you want to play out there, if you want to go out, find it, drill, we are going to tax you. We are going to penalize you instead of encourage you and incentivize you to discover, to bring it to the wellhead and to bring it to America's shores and to refine it for the American consumer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Anybody in a reasonable way who doesn't want to play the political game being played out on the floor as we speak--petrol politics--needs to vote no on cloture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the American consumer thinks these companies are going to pay the $32.1 billion in taxes, they have it wrong. They are going to pay it at the pump. The Baucus bill pumps tax dollars out of the back pocket of the American consumer. It does not allow oil to be pumped out of the ground. It does not allow us to hold a stronger political position in the world of petrol nationalism. That is the debate we are going through right now. It is about windmills. It is about cellulosic. It is about all  the things I like. But it really isn't. It is antiproduction. It is anticonsumer. It is anti-American to deny our Nation's economy access to the world energy supply. That is what we are doing. Let's allow Saudi Arabia and Iraq and Iran to grab us by the gas nozzle and jerk us around every time they choose. This tax package suggests that could start again tomorrow because we are not going to get ourselves back into the business of production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Montana.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is a very interesting series of statements we have heard in the last 15 minutes, half hour, statements basically trying to lead Americans to believe that this Finance Committee tax package, as well as the provisions of the tax package to pay for incentives so we can wean ourselves away from OPEC, away from all these countries, is going to result somehow in some cataclysmic event; namely, gasoline prices are going to go up, according to statements we have heard.  We have also heard that we are going to reduce domestic exploration and development of American oil companies; we are putting ourselves in the hands of foreign countries. The fact is, the exact opposite is the case. These statements are amazing. It is good political rhetoric, but it has nothing to do with the facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it is more important that people understand that the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, basically delegates to the Secretary of Energy whether $30 billion worth of tax provisions will be enacted. I am astounded that anybody in the Senate wants to delegate that decision to the Secretary of Energy instead of the U.S. Congress deciding whether the tax needs to be imposed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kyl amendment basically says that unless the Energy Secretary can determine that the effect of this will not increase the price of gasoline at the pump, that he, the Energy Secretary, or she, the Energy Secretary--whoever the Energy Secretary is--will automatically be forced to rescind the pay-fors in this bill. That is astounding. It is basically delegating to the Energy Secretary a policy which should be made by the Congress, and that is a huge dereliction of responsibility. I am appalled  that anybody would dare suggest it. But that is a fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, if we look at the whole bill, the Finance Committee package in the Energy bill and also the Kyl amendment, several things are striking. The first is the major underlying Finance Committee bill is designed to accomplish the objective that the Senator from Idaho is complaining about. The Senator from Idaho is complaining that this amendment transfers power to Venezuela or to Saudi Arabia, other countries. The whole point of this bill is the exact opposite. It is to wean ourselves away from  OPEC, wean ourselves away from those countries, so that we Americans are in a better position to determine our own destiny, in a better position to get more energy production here in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How do we do that? The committee bill does that through all kinds of incentives. It reduces taxes in lots of different ways for alternative energy, renewable energy, cellulosic development, encouraging more American clean coal technology so we can tap into our vast reserves of coal. It has lots of ways we could help America be more self-sufficient and wean ourselves away from these very high gasoline prices we are forced to pay partly because OPEC is forcing us to pay those prices; the truth  is, partly because the major oil companies are charging whatever the market will bear. That is why they are charging such high prices to the American consumer. What evidence do I have of that? It is very simple and direct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was stunned because of the candor of the CEO of ExxonMobil when he made this statement. This was last year at a Judiciary Committee hearing. I was not there; I was watching on C-SPAN. At that hearing, the exchange was essentially between the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, and the CEO of Exxon. I think Senator Kohl asked the question. This was an open hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said: Sir, why are gasoline prices so high now?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The answer: Well, Exxon has to pay more because OPEC is charging us more. So we to have pay more, and we transfer those price increases down to the American consumer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from Wisconsin asked the head of ExxonMobil: Explain this to me, please. At the same time, your profits have exploded. They have gone up about $35 billion this year. Your profits have expanded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Kohl said: I am a businessman. Ordinarily, if my costs go up, my profits go down. Please explain to me why you would say your costs are going up because OPEC is charging you more and yet your profits are going way up. Why?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His answer was very illustrative of the point here. He said, in all candor: Senator, my responsibility is not to the American consumer; my responsibility is to my stockholders. I will charge whatever the market will bear because I have a duty to protect my stockholders and get whatever I can for my stockholders. I am going to charge whatever I can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why profits are so high, because Americans can't put milk in their car or their truck. They can't put in water. They have to put in diesel fuel or gasoline. Americans are stuck. The majors are passing on through their distribution system these very high gasoline prices because they can get away with it and because it fattens profits and because they are beholden to stockholders, not the American consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What about these provisions which the Senator from Arizona wants to strike. There are three of them. It is very simple, and there is a reason why they are there and why they will not have the disastrous effect the Senator from Arizona claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first one is to rescind a tax break we gave to the five major oil companies back in 2004. It is called section 199.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We gave that tax break, frankly, to all American domestic manufacturers, including the oil companies. It was as a response to a WTO ruling a year or two earlier which said our American tax laws--which gave incentives for American products to be exported--were WTO illegal. So we came up with a backup plan. The backup plan was basically section 199 in the code, enacted in the 2004 Jobs Act, which says, OK, we will give an extra little break to domestic production in the United States. If they export  the products, fine; if they do not, that is fine. We will still give them a break. That is what that is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What has happened to domestic oil production in the United States since that was enacted in 2004? Well, one would think it probably increased a little bit because the major oil companies get a little tax break. The fact is, the exact opposite has happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me quote a couple statistics. In 2004, when that provision was put in effect, domestic production was about 170 million barrels a month. It was 170 million barrels a month in 2004. Well, you would think it would go up because of that tax break for domestic production. Oh, no, that is not what happened. It actually went down. It is down to about 160 million barrels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Look at the price of oil. Back in 2004, the price of oil was $40 a barrel. Now it is about $65 a barrel. Well, gee, you would think--that is more money in the oil companies' coffers--they would want to use that for more exploration, more development. No. Again, there is less domestic production, even with the price of oil so high over that period of time and even though they have had a tax break. I might add, too, the price of gasoline at the pump back then was about $2 a gallon. Today, it is  above $3 a gallon. So that did not help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, gee, we thought: We will take that away. It did not help, so we will take it away. So, therefore, it seems to me it is not going to cause an increase in the price of gasoline at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might say, the statistics cited by the Senator from Arizona are based on the Heritage Foundation. I am not going to get into the question of who financed that study--I have an idea who financed that study; and, therefore, it drove the results they would like to get--but that is the same organization that said Iraqi oil is going to pay for Iraq reconstruction too. They were dead wrong then, and they are dead wrong now. They are an organization which, frankly, I think is not the most objective,  independent organization in the world. That is the first one. That is why we made that first change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second provision in the Finance Committee bill the Senator's amendment wants to strike is a loophole closer. We are trying to close a loophole. The Joint Committee on Taxation said--that is a bipartisan organization, the Joint Committee on Taxation, which serves both the House and the Senate, Republicans and Democrats--their independent study shows there is a big loophole the major oil companies take with respect to foreign tax breaks in this area; that is, ordinarily a company gets to reduce  its income taxes in the amount of the foreign taxes that company pays to a foreign country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the law is different between exploration costs and distribution downstream costs. The companies game the system. They offset one against the other. Joint Tax saw this big loophole. Let's close it. That is the second provision. Also, I do not see how anybody could argue against that. It is a big loophole closer. It makes the Tax Code more fair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we get to the third provision. This is the so-called confiscatory excise tax on the oil produced in the Gulf of Mexico. Let's be honest. First of all, the President of the United States, himself, believes there is insufficient revenue paid to Uncle Sam on these OCS leases. The best evidence: The President of the United States, himself, has enacted a 6 2/3 -percent royalty on all new leases in the gulf. He thinks they are not paying enough. He has increased the current royalty--it was 12  percent. The bill has a 13-percent severance tax. The President, himself, has enacted a whole new higher royalty provision on new leases in the gulf. He thinks they are undertaxed. Right now it is about a 12-percent royalty. This provision in our Finance Committee bill says a 13-percent severance tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, Congress has the power to enact a tax. The royalties paid by any company are credited against the 13 percent, and so it is a net lower than what the President thinks the amount should be in revenue paid by the oil and gas companies in the gulf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might also say the General Accounting Office has done a study of how much America taxes oil and gas compared with how other countries tax oil and gas. What is the result of the GAO study? The result of the GAO study is we Americans basically tax oil and gas less than other jurisdictions around the world--or other States. The State of Alaska is taxing more. Other countries tax more now. We Americans  are pretty easy and soft compared to other countries on how much we tax oil and gas revenues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this argument that somehow, oh, my gosh, America is going to tax oil and gas companies with these provisions--that it is confiscatory; they are going to go overseas--it is just nonsense. It is just total nonsense because, already, oil and gas revenue in the United States is not taxed as much as it is in other jurisdictions. It seems to me, therefore, it is not unfair to enact this provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The main point is if the Kyl amendment passes, then the Finance Committee tax title of this bill is dead because we are not paying for it, effectively. That is because the Energy Secretary, under the Kyl amendment, probably would rule that maybe prices might go up at the pump, given the politics of it all, and that means we do not have a bill anymore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, I urge Senators to say: OK, let's do what is right. Let's start to wean ourselves from OPEC. Let's start to give some incentives to American domestic producers of alternative fuels, renewable fuels, and have more conservation measures to help America again take control of our own destiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a perfect bill. Nothing is perfect. But it is a good bill. It is a very good bill. It helps put America back on track, helps America turn the corner toward more energy independence, and enhances our national security so we are less reliant upon OPEC, less reliant upon those countries to which some Senators say this bill gives a break. It does not. This bill does the exact opposite. It helps America become America again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to address why we should have cloture on this bill to get to finality--and that is going to take 60 votes--and why you should not support the Kyl amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the debate on some of this bill, particularly in committee, we had the issue of, well, we are taxing oil companies to promote renewable fuels; that this is an industrial policy, and it is bad for Congress to be involved in industrial policy. Basically, I agree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, remember, throughout the history of this country, Congress has been involved in a lot of industrial policy. There would not be a farmstead today that would have electricity if we did not have rural electric cooperatives. Railroads would have a monopoly on hauling things if we did not have river improvements so that barges could work as well. Railroads would still be hauling most of our commerce if we had not built an interstate system. Airports and airlines are all about the Government promoting  competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, we are involved in where we are, taxing the oil industry to get a renewable energy industry started--as we  have been for 20 years now just with ethanol, and expanding it beyond ethanol, but we would not have an ethanol industry today if we had not had tax incentives over the last few years. There will be, someday--just like we are saying to the oil companies today: You got your start because of tax policy, a lot of tax benefits, because the oil  industry was infant at one time and needed to get started. The same thing is true of alternative energy. If we do not give some tax incentives to get alternative energy--and I mean beyond ethanol: biodiesel, wind energy, things that maybe we do not even have on our</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think we ought to look at the reality of how a gigantic oil industry got started in the United States--through tax incentives. We are talking about tax incentives to get alternative energy started. That is why I hope you will abide by the decisions the Committee on Finance made to have these situations where there is some tax on oil companies for the benefit of tax credits for alternative energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope you also appreciate the fact that maybe a lot of us would like to have the tax incentives without offsets, but we are in an environment of pay-go. We are not in a reconciliation situation. We are in a situation where we have to provide the necessary offsets in order to get this legislation through.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope you will think of the history of where we have been with tax policies to promote an industry that is out there now. I hope you will understand that God only made so much fossil fuel and there has to be a follow-on if we are going to have the growth of our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to state this one last point that I have heard the President of the United States make many times when I have been to the White House in the Oval Office to talk energy. The President has said many times that with these high prices of oil the way they are, we do not need any more incentives for the oil companies to get more energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has been a friend of alternative energy, most often expressing his support of ethanol, but a supporter of alternative energy, and I hope he is in support of this legislation as well.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Montana. I want to publicly state what I have stated several times in the last few days, and that is my appreciation to Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley for their leadership in putting this tax package together that has been reported favorably by the Finance Committee on which I am privileged to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me speak, briefly, about the Kyl amendment and then talk about the tax package more generally and why we should vote to invoke cloture on this tax package and proceed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the Kyl amendment, my first concern is the obvious one: that adoption of the Kyl amendment would be totally irresponsible as a fiscal matter. The Kyl amendment says "notwithstanding any other provision of the subtitle," the subtitle being those provisions that raise revenue to pay for this. We are in a pay-go situation in the Senate under our budgetary arrangements, so if we are going to provide tax credits and tax benefits to some parts of the economy, we need to pay for that. We need to  find some way to obtain the revenue. The way the committee has found is to reduce the tax benefits that some other parts of the economy are enjoying today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So Senator Kyl's amendment says "notwithstanding the provisions of"--the provisions in the tax package that raise revenue--none of this shall "take effect unless the Secretary of Energy" positively decides, that is, "certifies that such amendments shall not increase gasoline retail prices and the reliance of the United States on foreign sources of energy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, essentially, we are saying it is up to the Secretary of Energy whether we pay for this set of tax provisions. I do not think it is responsible for this Congress to take that position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mean it is great, and I know everybody likes to be able to go home and say: I didn't oppose the production tax credit extension which is in the bill, I didn't oppose the investment tax credit for solar energy which is in the bill, I didn't oppose the provisions that would incentivize more biofuels production; all I opposed was the idea that we should pay for them. I don't think that is a responsible position for us to take.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the general tax package and the cloture issue, let me say, the arguments I have heard are three. Some have argued this is going to reduce production; some have argued it is going to increase the price of gas; some have argued this is going to hurt the energy companies. Let me address each of those points briefly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On reducing production, I don't think this is going to reduce domestic production of oil and gas. I think Senator Baucus made the point very clearly that the two big items that are being used to pay for this tax package are this section 199 provision, which was not even in the law until 2004. We are taking that away as it applies to certain large companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, of course, the severance tax provision. Let me talk a minute about that. I wasn't here last evening when Senator Bunning was speaking, but I noticed he referred to it as Senator Bingaman's "scheme" in his comments last night. The severance tax proposal is not that; it is a 13-percent tax which would apply prospectively; there is nothing retrospective about it. It is prospective. It applies to all production of oil and gas that occurs in the Outer Continental Shelf and  in the Gulf of Mexico. It is designed so it will not be unduly burdensome on any company that is producing in the Gulf of Mexico. I think we have done a good job in accomplishing that. It does not abrogate contracts. It is a forward-looking tax provision which I think is eminently reasonable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would raise some revenue that is sorely needed if we are going to extend these tax provisions, including the production tax credit, the investment tax credit, and the other provisions that are in this bill. I feel very strongly that we should keep it in place, and it is an appropriate way for this Congress to proceed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second argument we heard was if we adopt this, we are going to see an increase in the price of gas. The truth is we all know the price of oil is determined on the world market. Our producers produce something like 5 percent of the oil that goes into the world market. So the idea that for us to raise some revenue here is going to affect the price of gas at the pump is not true. If the world price of oil goes up, we wind up paying more at the pump; if the world price of oil goes down, we wind  up paying less at the pump. I think American consumers have watched that occur year after year and they understand that is the circumstance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other argument is this is going to hurt our energy companies, that this is an undue burden on them. When you look at the reality, the reported profits of the top five integrated oil and gas producers last year were over $111 billion. I don't begrudge them that, but that is 1 year, and that is 5 companies. If profits continue at somewhere in that range, we can reasonably expect very conservatively that producers--large producers of oil and gas--will have over the next 10 years over $1 trillion  in profits.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>So we have $1 trillion of profits over the next 10 years. This package calls for raising $27 billion over the next 10 years. So that is something in the range of 2.5 percent of profits, a much smaller percentage of revenues, of total revenues. So I point out that is not an undue burden on  anyone, and I think all of these screams that this is the end of the world for the oil and gas industry are not founded on any kind of basis in fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the whole purpose here is to do some very good things in the Tax Code, which I compliment the Senator from Montana and the Senator from Iowa for proposing, and to do so by--under our pay-go rules, find revenue where it will reduce production at the very least, and I think they have done an excellent job in accomplishing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the tax package and vote for cloture on the tax package when it comes up for a vote following the Kyl amendment, and obviously I urge all Members to oppose the Kyl amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, when oil was $55 a barrel, President Bush said oil companies don't need taxpayer subsidies to drill. Oil is now just under $70 a barrel, and certainly oil companies truly don't need taxpayer subsidies to drill for oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Finance Committee amendment begins to reverse decades of policies that equated what was good for the major oil companies was good for America, and that oil companies would get us cheap and plentiful energy supplies here in America. The reality is, if you go to the gas pump today, you see gas is not cheap. If you look at the impact of a refinery fire or a pipeline problem or a cold snap and the impact on heating oil prices, you see energy is not plentiful. If you look at the growing level  of oil imports from countries around the world that don't have our best interests at heart, you will see that what has been good for the major oil companies has not been good for the well-being of the citizens of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kyl amendment is just the latest in a long line of arguments that has been advanced on the theory that we ought to keep subsidizing the oil industry or energy prices will go up, oil imports will go up, and America will be less secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is our people and our country have now experienced the results of past policies based on the idea that we ought to send billions and billions of dollars of subsidies to the major companies. It is time to end those subsidies. It is time to stop the major oil companies from fleecing taxpayers when they drill for oil on public lands, and it is time to embrace the very different vision of a more positive energy future, largely constructed by the chairman of the Finance Committee and the  chairman of the Energy Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote against the Kyl amendment and to support the work of the Finance Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss my opposition to a few of the provisions in the Finance Committee-passed energy tax package. Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to thank Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley for their work on this amendment. I know they have exerted an incredible amount of energy to get this legislation to the floor so that we can debate it as part of this Energy bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The package we are debating includes a number of important provisions. It includes additional funding for clean renewable energy bonds, which are important to rural electric cooperatives who seek to build clean generation. It includes accelerated depreciation for carbon dioxide pipelines, which will encourage more carbon sequestration. It also includes a carbon capture credit that will make it more economical for some carbon dioxide to be used in enhanced oil recovery and for some carbon dioxide  to be sequestered. These are important provisions, and I am pleased to see them included in this package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although that is the case, I have grave concerns about the impact of this tax package. I am specifically concerned about its impact on consumers. When taken as a whole, I believe that the package will lead to increased gas prices and will have a detrimental impact on our country's quest to become energy independent by discouraging domestic energy production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment contains approximately $28.6 billion in "revenue raisers" over the next 10 years. The phrase "revenue raisers" is Washington speak for tax increases, and I find it hard to believe that we can increase taxes by $28.6 billion and have no impact on the price of gasoline at the pump for the average American. Businesses are in business to make money, and when we increase their taxes, they pass that increase along to the consumer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not ExxonMobil or Shell or BP that will pay for these tax increases. It is the senior citizen on a fixed income who fills up her station wagon. It is the soccer mom who drives her children to school. This tax title is not punishing the companies. It is punishing the American people who rely on energy to fuel their daily lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, I am concerned that three provisions of this bill will increase gas prices and will discourage energy production at a time when our Nation's supply does not meet our Nation's demand. Last week, I joined a number of my colleagues in a letter to the Senate Finance Committee that urged the committee not to repeal the section 199 manufacturing deduction, and I am disappointed to note that this was included. The Joint Tax Committee estimates that the repeal of the section 199 deduction  will raise $9.43 billion over a 10-year period. That is $9.43 billion that will be passed along to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also disappointed that the legislation includes a new 13-percent severance tax for oil produced in the Outer Continental Shelf, OCS. The OCS represents one of America's greatest energy sources, and raising taxes on those who hope to produce in the OCS will most certainly not encourage the domestic energy production that we all believe is so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I am concerned that this legislation changes what is known as the foreign tax credit. This change, which amounts to double taxation, will increase taxes by $3.2 billion over the next 10 years. Someone has to pay for that tax increase, and I am concerned that it will be the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I appreciate the work of my colleagues, at the end of the day, I am extremely concerned that this legislation will slow domestic energy production and increase the prices paid by consumers. There are a number of good provisions in this bill that I do support. However, at the end of the day, raising taxes is not the way to increase energy production and decrease energy prices. I would urge my colleagues to oppose cloture on this amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to respond to some of the arguments that have been made. First, I do appreciate the candor of both the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Iowa. Rather than arguing that these tax increases are loophole closers, as has been suggested, they candidly acknowledge the reason for the tax increases is to pay for the costs of the bill. As the Senator from Iowa said, we want to avoid offsets, but we can't. We have to pay for the costs of the bill. So, so much for  the argument that these tax increases are loophole closers. They are, very plainly, necessary to pay for the cost of the bill, so they are tax increases. I appreciate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another bit of candor: The Senator from Montana quoting--or paraphrasing, anyway--the former chairman of Exxon Oil Company, essentially argued that it is OK to add these taxes on oil companies because they make too much money, and they make too much profit, so we are justified in taxing them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not going to argue with that theory. If they make too much money,  we are going to tax them, if that is the argument for imposing these new taxes. All I say is as long as it doesn't raise the price of gasoline for American consumers, then I guess the question would be: Who cares? But if they do raise the cost of gasoline for American consumers, then I think we should care. That is all this amendment does. It says: If it doesn't raise the cost of  gasoline, go ahead and impose the tax. If these oil companies are making too much money, go ahead and tax them. But if the result of it is not just to hurt the oil companies but to hurt the American consumer, then Congress says: Wait a minute; not so fast. We are not going to allow that to happen. That is all this amendment does. So we don't say you can't tax. What we say is, you can't tax if it has a negative impact on the American consumer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there was a question about the Heritage study. I noticed there was no attack on the numbers, no refutation of the numbers, just: Well, who paid for the study? I don't know who paid for the study. I presume Heritage paid for the study. It is their study. What does it say and why is it such a burr under the saddle of those who oppose my amendment? Well, it found that the tax provisions in this bill, setting aside the other mandates, will likely increase gas prices by 21 cents per gallon over  the next 8 years, and taking all of the provisions of the bill together, it can increase the price of regular unleaded gas from $3.14 a gallon to $6.40 a gallon in the year 2016, over the next 10 years. That is a 104-percent increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If that is the case, even if it is only half that much, it is a huge hit to the American consumer and we shouldn't even be thinking about that kind of a hit on the American consumer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this point a letter from the Chamber of Commerce of the United State of America. It is dated June 20, 2007.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>This is a letter from R. Bruce Josten, who makes the point that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce opposes the tax increases in the bill and supports the amendment which I offer, which would condition that tax increase on not hurting American consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would require the Secretary of Energy to certify that the tax provisions included in <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> will not lead to increased reliance on foreign oil or higher gasoline prices for American consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, they support the amendment, and I believe they will key it as a key vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He goes on to say:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Chamber strongly opposes the tax title of this bill because it contains many proposals that amount to little more than a modern-day Windfall Profits Tax. When that tax was enacted in 1980, it resulted in higher prices for consumers, long waits at gasoline lines, and increased consumption of foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what we are concerned about here. If the tax increases don't have that effect, then nobody has to worry about it. But if they do have that effect on the American consumers, they would not go into effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My penultimate point is the argument that we have to do something to wean ourselves from OPEC, so what do we do? We slap a new 13-percent tax on the production of new oil. How does that help wean us from OPEC? What it does is to say to the producers of oil: You go out and find some, and by the way, if you do, we are going to hit you with a new tax. This is a perverse incentive, not a proper incentive.</paragraph>

If anyone believes that, I think we have some good bridges to sell you right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth is the oil companies are ripping off the American people. This moment in American history is a time that our country needs to radically change the way it does energy, and the Finance Committee, in a bipartisan way, and the Energy Committee, in a bipartisan way, are making some very clear statements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What they are saying is that global warming is a huge problem for this Nation today, and if we do not get a handle on it, that problem will only intensify in years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we must begin to do, and what this legislation is making clear, is that we have to break our dependency on fossil fuel, we have to move to energy efficiency, we have to move toward sustainable energy, and in that process not only can we substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions but we can also create millions of good-paying jobs for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the chairman of the Energy Committee made clear a moment ago, the oil companies, year after year, are making recordbreaking profits. I for one do not stay up nights worrying about ExxonMobil, when a few years ago they were able to provide a $400 million retirement package to their former CEO.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will take the remaining 2 minutes. This whole debate boils down to something pretty simple and basic; that is, do we as Americans want to begin to become more self-sufficient in our energy production? Do we want to be less reliant on OPEC? Do we want to give incentives to new clean energy industries to develop in America--not just renewables and alternatives but also clean coal technologies and other ways to help America be more self-sufficient?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress, for many years, has provided some very significant tax incentives to the oil and gas industry to help America be strong, to make sure we as Americans have a strong industrial base and a strong energy base to fuel our industries. That was probably the right thing to do over the years from 1926, and the various provisions that have helped America. I think the time has come for us to give incentives to other industries, alternative energy, renewable fuels, clean coal technologies, cellulosic,  and so forth--the same kinds of incentives that the oil  and gas industry have enjoyed for decades and decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are not taking away these incentives from the oil and gas industry at all. We are just saying the time has come for us to give incentives to make America more self-sufficient in the production of energy. This bill helps accomplish that result, and the way we do that is very fair and balanced. It will not have the horrible results that are claimed here. I urge our colleagues to begin to take--we will still have huge breaks for the oil and gas, but we give help on the margin to new independent  energy sources in America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, in closing the debate on this amendment, I will respond to the point that both the Senator from Vermont and the chairman have just made, and that is the need to promote renewable energy and to give incentives to those producers. That is a fine sentiment, but my amendment has nothing to do with that. My amendment doesn't affect these incentives one iota. It doesn't speak to them at all. So that is a straw man, just as it is a straw man to argue that we ought to have the  right to sock it to the oil companies because they are making huge profits. I am not arguing that proposition. In fact, yesterday, I offered an amendment to eliminate a real loophole in one of those subsidies that one oil company is going to be taking advantage of, and both of the Senators whom I mentioned voted to support that subsidy. I voted to eliminate it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not trying to protect the oil companies, obviously. I am trying to protect the American consumer. My amendment says if the American consumer comes out OK, tax the oil companies. My amendment says if the American consumers are going to lose, then we say no, and then there are unintended consequences to these sentiments of socking it to the oil companies, creating subsidies for renewable energy producers and so on, fine. But if it adversely affects American consumers and increases our dependency  upon foreign oil, then does anybody argue that we should do this? Wouldn't they instead try to find another way to achieve the objective? I think the answer is yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment says: Do what you want to do here, but if it adversely affects the American consumer or increases our dependence on foreign oil, that is where we say no, we need to find another way to do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment doesn't affect the underlying subsidies and doesn't say that you cannot impose additional taxes. These arguments are straw men. All I say is, if the American consumers end up being the losers, as they sometimes have been with our tax policies, if these are the unintended consequences and we become more dependent upon foreign oil, then we say no. That is all this amendment does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to think carefully about this, and I hope they will support my amendment. We are going to vote on it right now, but first I think the chairman wants to raise a point of order. I yield the floor at this time for him to do that.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="TRIBUTE TO SENATOR FRANK LAUTENBERG">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, a few minutes ago, a record was broken. Senator Frank Lautenberg has passed Senator Clifford Case's record for the most votes cast by a Senator from the State of New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lautenberg's career can't possibly be summed up, though, on numbers alone. I have had the good fortune of serving with this man in the Senate since I came here. Sometimes the term "American Dream" is thrown around, and probably a bit too much, but if there were ever a Member of this body who exemplifies the American Dream, it is Frank Lautenberg, the Senator from New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frank Lautenberg was born without privilege to immigrant parents. He served his country bravely in World War II and put himself through Columbia University on the GI bill. He is an example of what the GI Bill of Rights did for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frank Lautenberg achieved great personal success in the business world, but he wanted to do more than be a successful businessman. And he was a successful businessman, both in reputation and in the ability to make money in our great free enterprise system. He was an exemplar of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He decided he would seek public service, and, very unusually, he shot for the top. He ran for the Senate--and ran and ran and ran--and was elected in 1982. Senator Lautenberg's legislative record is fantastic. It is terrific. He has been a titan here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Guns and crime: Author of the Domestic Violence Ban, and sponsored countless laws to make neighborhoods safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Health and safety: He led the fight regarding drunk driving by toughening Federal laws and penalties relating thereto in the States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The environment: I had the good fortune of serving with him on the Environment Committee from the first day I arrived in the Senate, and I do say to Frank, and he knows this, that as a result of his having a very short retirement, voluntarily, I was fortunate enough to be able to become the chairman of that committee twice. Had he been here, he would have been the chairman on those two occasions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But no one, and I say it without any reservation, has a better environmental record in the history of our country than Frank Lautenberg. He sponsored countless laws to reduce pollution; clean up Superfund sites. One of the real battles of the Senate in recent years was the battle he and the ranking member had--and the chairman, they went back and forth--as to what would happen regarding the Superfund in the Environment and Public Works Committee. He has followed that like no one else  has ever followed it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has promoted recycling by legislation. He has done legislation to protect our drinking water. Very importantly, he has ensured the public's right to know about environmental hazards in our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For me, personally, the legislative accolade that I wish to give him relates to what he did regarding smoking cigarettes. I have five children, and traveling back and forth to Nevada as we have done, one of my boys was terribly affected by cigarette smoke. They tried something where you could only smoke in certain parts of the airplane, but that didn't work. If you are allergic to cigarette smoke, that didn't work. And my boy, Key, suffered as a result of people smoking in those airplanes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Frank Lautenberg took on this battle, people actually made fun of him--why would he take on the tobacco industry; and if he did, did he mind losing? Well, he lost a few battles, but he won the war, and my boy is extremely happy he did win that war. Today they do not even have ashtrays on commercial airlines anymore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The list is longer than I can possibly enumerate of his legislative accomplishments, but one of the things that is not a legislative accomplishment that I so admire about Frank Lautenberg is his sense of humor. There is a story he tells, and he tells a number of stories, and I would go around and ask him, would you tell your story again, and he would tell it just as good as the last time. The one reason I so admire his humor is he reminds me of Red Skelton, because even though he has  retold those jokes many times, in my presence, he laughed harder each time at his own jokes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Suffice to say, when the day has come, and it will come, when historians write about Senator Frank Lautenberg, he will be hailed as a great legislator for the State of New Jersey, a legend in the Senate, and a foremost legislator of great repute standing up for the health, safety, and welfare of every single American, not just those from New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His record-breaking vote is reason enough to honor him, but his tremendous record is an accomplishment that will endure for many generations to come. Congratulations, Frank.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="HONORING SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD ON HIS 18,000TH VOTE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the man seated behind me, Robert Byrd, just voted for the 18,000th time, more than any other Senator in history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell a couple of things that are important to me about my relationship with this unusually brilliant man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had returned from Nevada to Washington. I was a new Senator. I asked Senator Byrd what he had done that weekend--he was standing back here. He said: I have been studying the Roman Empire. I am reading, for the third time, Gibbon's "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said: What did you do? I was a little chagrined. I said: Well, I grabbed a little pocketbook out of my library at home. It was "The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He looked--we all know Senator Byrd when he is thinking about something. He rolled his head back, and he looked up and he said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Robinson Crusoe, let's see. How long was he on that island? Twenty-eight years, two months, two weeks, and five days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I looked at him like: What are you talking about? I just read the book. I didn't know how long he had been there. So I went home that night and looked. Senator Byrd was right. Robinson Crusoe had been on that island 28 years, 2 months, 2 weeks, and 5 days. I bet he hadn't read the book in 45 or 50 years, but he remembered that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us will remember how he disliked the line-item veto. He came to the Senate floor once a week for 10 weeks and gave a lecture on the evils of the line-item veto. But he did it in a unique way because it was all about the fall of the Roman Empire. His thesis was that the Roman Empire fell because the executive took power away from the legislative branch of government. He gave 10 lectures, every lecture lasting exactly 1 hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is not a professor who teaches Roman history who could give the detailed lecture on the Roman Empire that Senator Byrd did, but he gave it. It was so good. At the University of Las Vegas they had a political science department, and they took those lectures and turned them into a course, a graduate course.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What was quite remarkable is he did it without a note. He just walked out here and gave his lecture. As we know, he referred to the Emperors and how long they were there and the battles that took place and the times they took place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said: Senator Byrd, tell me how you do that without a note.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He looked at me and said, "I memorized what I was going to say." So he gave 10 hours of lectures, and every word of it he memorized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could tell stories about this man for a long time. Let me just tell one more. I was a fairly new Senator. Some of the Senators may be listening to this who went on this little trip we took to West Virginia. He invited the British parliamentarians to meet with us, a few Senators, in the hills of West Virginia. It was beautiful. They had bluegrass music there. It was a festive occasion for a relatively small number of British parliamentarians and Senators. He even sang.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can still remember him singing: "There's More Pretty Girls Than One." Senator Byrd sang that. But the music stopped, and he said: OK, if anybody hears anything that I have said that is wrong, I have given a little notebook and pencil. You write it down and we'll talk about it later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He proceeded to tell us and the British parliamentarians about the reign of the British monarchs, starting from the beginning. Remember, he has no notes, he is just standing there, starting from the beginning. If it was necessary, he would spell the name of the monarch. Every one of them he gave the years they reigned. If it was something interesting that happened during their reign, he would tell us about it. It took him about 1 hour and 20 minutes to do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The British parliamentarians were dumbfounded. Here is this American Senator telling them far more than they knew about their own country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This man has been such an inspiration to all of us, with his mind, this incredible mind. I just finished reading Walter Isakson's "Einstein"--a wonderful book, 528 pages, that talks about this brilliant genius. I did not know and I did not have the opportunity to meet Albert Einstein, but I had the opportunity to meet this genius. He has an unparalleled knowledge of the Rules of the Senate. He has a reverence for this institution that is unsurpassed. One of the things that I think is so important  is that he believes in the Constitution. I have here with me--the other one is worn out, but I have here, with a very nice inscription that I prize--I have it with me virtually every day--signed by the Senator from West Virginia, Robert Byrd.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These gifts he has been given by the Almighty bring to my mind words from Ralph Waldo Emerson in his "Essays on Self-Reliance," which was 10,000 words long. Now, Senator Byrd, if he were familiar with this, would recite it. I cannot. I can't give you 10,000 words, but I am going to give you the last paragraph of this brilliant essay by Ralph Waldo Emerson, which I think talks about who this man is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Use all that is called Fortune.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most men gamble with her, and gain all, and lose all, as her wheel rolls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But do thou leave as unlawful these winnings, and deal with Cause and Effect,  the chancellors of God. In the Will work and acquire, and thou hast chained the wheel of Chance, and shalt sit hereafter out of fear from her rotations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A political victory, a rise of rents, the recovery of your sick, or the return of your absent friend, or some other favorable event raises your spirits, and you think good days are preparing for you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do not believe it. Nothing can bring you peace but yourself. Nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of principles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So said Ralph Waldo Emerson. I congratulate the Senator from West Virginia, Robert Byrd, for accomplishing all he has done as a Member of the Senate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I love this Senate. I love it dearly. I love the Senate for its rules. I love the Senate for its precedents. I love the Senate for the difference it can make in people's lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate was viewed by the Framers as a place where mature wisdom would reside. The Senate was intended to serve as a check on both the House of Representatives and the Executive. The longer terms, the older age requirements, the special functions delegated to the Senate regarding treaties, appointments, impeachment--all of these are indicative of the intent by the Framers to have the Senate be the stabilizer, the fence, the check on attempts at tyranny, and the calmer political passions. Partisanship  was not viewed as necessary or constructive in that day in time so long ago, nor, may I say, is total devotion to partisanship constructive in this day in time or in any day in time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have served in this Chamber for nearly five decades--nearly 50 years. Times have changed. The world has changed. But our responsibilities, our duties, as Senators have not changed. We have a responsibility, a duty, to the people to make our country a better place. The people send us here to do a job. They do not send us here to score political points or to advance our personal agenda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I could have one wish as I cast this 18,000th vote, it could be that the Senate could put aside the political games, roll up our sleeves, and get back to  work for the great people of this great country of America.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Maryland.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300073" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, the Senate is trying to come up with an energy bill. I know Senators have been working very hard on all sides of the aisle to come up with consensus legislation we can support, and I really do support them. I wish to particularly call to the attention of the Senate the efforts of Senators Pryor and Levin and Stabenow to try to come up with a compromise on the CAFE. But we are now where we are. We are at a very important juncture in our history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know me. I am a blue-collar Senator. My heart and soul lies with the blue-collar American. I spent most of my life in a blue-collar neighborhood. When Bethlehem Steel went on strike, my dad gave those workers credit. When UAW was having a hard time, my father and mother tried to smooth the way by helping them in the grocery store. My career and my public service is one of deep commitment to the working people. So when automobile manufacturers told me they could not meet the increased CAFE  standards, I listened. I listened year after year, and now I have listened for more than 20 years. When they told me they needed more time, I agreed. When they told me an increase in CAFE standards was unattainable with existing technology, I voted against the increase to give more time so we could come up with attainable and existing technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But 20 years have gone by since the last increase in fuel efficiency standards. I was here when we voted for those CAFE standards. Now, after 20 years, I firmly do believe it is time for a change--not any kind of change--a smart change, a feasible change, an affordable change. That is why I support the Energy bill that is before us. I support the framework that has been generally presented by Senator Feinstein of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that American automobile manufacturers and their workers are true patriots. They want what is best for our Nation. They have faced challenges before and they have met them and I believe they will face these challenges now. I believe they want to build vehicles that are safer and more energy efficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time has now come to increase fuel efficiency standards. We need a national effort. We need a national standard. It is time for our automobile industry to make the changes because they need to be able to do that to help their own industry survive and also for the interest of the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe our world and our Nation is facing a crisis. When you look at the increased gas prices at the pump, it is hurting every single one of us. When you talk to families, you learn it now costs $90 to fill up a minivan. A commuter who has no other way to get to work than an automobile is now paying more to get to work than they are for their food bill in certain areas. As the Presiding Officer knows, small businesses need those vans to make those deliveries, whether they own a flower shop,  whether they are a heating and air-conditioning guy, whether they are a plumber or whether they are the person delivering pharmaceuticals to nursing homes. In my own State right now, the watermen, those fishermen are out on the Chesapeake Bay trying to harvest ever-diminishing crabs with ever-increasing fuel prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to conserve our energy resources and to deal with the crisis we are facing. We know that energy and gasoline and petroleum products are in limited supply and are going up. We know that America's dependence on foreign oil presents a very serious national security challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am on the Intelligence Committee, and I know what these transnational threats are. I know that energy independence is absolutely crucial to fighting the global war against terrorism. If we follow the money, we know that every time we are putting money into the tank, we are putting money into the pockets of the petro jihadists, those petro jihadists who are trying to undermine us everywhere around the world. They are undermining and attacking our troops in Iraq. They are funding Hezbollah so  they can attack Israel; Hugo Chavez, shake, rattling, and rolling in Latin America. Do we want our money going to the petro jihadists who want to plot and destroy not only American lives but the American way of life? I don't want to support al-Qaida by buying more gasoline than I have to, but this is what Iran, Venezuela, and others are doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and that is one of the most important ways we can as the public is by fighting the war against terrorism. There are 150,000 men and women fighting in Iraq today. The temperature is 110 degrees. We already have lost 14 more military. While we are doing that, though, there are 300 million of us who don't have to share in the sacrifice of the battle in Iraq, but we can share in that sacrifice if we embrace energy conservation and are serious about  it. At the same time, we know there is a dangerous increase in the climate crisis that affects the life of our planet. It, too, is a national security issue because, make no mistake, the climate crisis will affect our food supply and will create a climate in which infectious disease will grow and natural disasters will increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What can we do about it? How can we sign up to have a safer America, a safer planet? Well, I believe the most sensible foundation of an energy plan must begin with conservation. We have to make better use of what we have in our homes, in our businesses, in our cars, and in our airplanes. We also need incentives for new renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies that we can use in our homes and in our businesses and an increase in fuel efficiency standards for our vehicles on the road  and our vehicles in the air.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in considering any fuel efficiency standard, otherwise known as CAFE, I come back to where I began: My heart and soul lies with the American worker, so I believe anything we do must preserve American jobs, but it also must achieve real savings in oil consumption. It also has to be realizable and achievable. That means a real technological ability to accomplish it. That means a reasonable lead time to adjust our production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also believe we have to create incentives to enable companies to achieve those goals. I don't believe in an industrial policy where we pick winners and losers, but if we are going to pick a winning energy policy, we have to provide some type of help to the industry to help them get where we need for them to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1950s, when part of the world saw the Iron Curtain come down and they went into communism, many against their own will, such as Poland, Latvia, and Estonia, there was a whole other world that chose to go with what they called a Socialist tendency. We saw industrial democracies such as England, France, and Canada develop a national health system. We said: Oh, no, we are Americans. We don't want to go that way. We don't want to have a national health system. So we said to the private sector:  Provide health care, provide pensions, and we will support that. So our American manufacturing base went to a defined benefit. They did provide health care. They did provide pensions. Now, they should not be penalized for it. Yet you look at the fact that our American manufacturers and our automobile industry itself does carry the legacy cost</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's put our thinking caps on. Let's not only help one industry. Maybe this is the time to motivate us to get serious about having universal health care and a real prescription drug benefit so we don't dump it on the private sector to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also know, when we look at this in terms of preserving jobs, we need to also make sure that the technology is achievable, and I believe it is. I believe also there are certain waivers in this bill that help them achieve--that deal with the fact that if they cannot increase some of these standards, the mandates can be waived. But you don't get an energy policy by mandates alone. We can't mandate and regulate our way out of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to vote to raise fuel efficiency standards, only because I am so convinced it is in our national security  interests. But I do not want to ignore the economic impact that this is going to have on the automobile  industry. We can't just mandate and we can't just regulate. So I say to my colleagues, if we are going to go energy, then let's go to health care. If we are going to go energy, then let's fix the prescription drug benefit and don't talk about vetoes and filibusters. Let's now work in our national interests. Let's now work for our manufacturing base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Out-of-control health care costs mean that companies are less able to be innovative and invest in technology. Our current President likes to talk a lot about relieving the tax burden, but to our business community, the cost of health care is a tax because we have not gotten serious about how to provide affordable health care, both to the people who want to buy it and businesses who want to provide it. So let's get rid of that health care tax on American business and come up with universal health  care. Last year we made some progress in helping manufacturers meet their pension obligations, and we can do it in health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time has come to raise the CAFE standards, but the time has come also to put our thinking caps on, to be an innovation society, and to come up with new ideas for efficiency, new technologies for energy efficiency, new composite materials to make cars lighter but keep them safe, and at the same time to seriously come to grips with health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not an easy vote for me. I am telling you, this is not an easy vote for me. I have always, for 20 years, stood with colleagues such as Senators Levin and Stabenow. I stand with them now. But I also know that if the American automobile industry is going to survive and that if we are going to deal with the petro jihadists, we need to get serious about fuel efficiency. Let's get serious about the legislation. Let's get serious about health care. Let's be serious about the American workers,  and let's get the job done the people want us to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today, I know we voted for cloture on the bill, but we have to continue to speak up on what we need to do to make us a safer country, but to keep a stronger economy, and for God's sake, could we start to be smarter about it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the first thing I want to do is take a minute to publicly thank the majority leader for the kindness he extended to me earlier when he announced the fact that I have cast the second-highest number of votes of any Senator from the State of New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am as surprised as anybody in this Chamber that this event took place and that kind of longevity has been extended to me by the people of New Jersey. I now enter the middle of my 23rd year in the Senate and I want to continue to serve. But that is a discussion for another time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority leader was very generous in his comments about me. Coming from a person who has provided so much by way of leadership and contribution to the country as Harry Reid, it is a touching experience. We are busy, but Senator Reid took time out of the business of the day to note the fact that I had achieved that record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The biggest surprise of all is, for me, the fact that I have been in this Chamber as long as I have been. I spent 30 years building a company with a couple of colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the legend of America--what can happen even if you are born poor but you have some assistance. I wore the uniform of this country proudly during World War II. I was a beneficiary of the GI Bill of Rights. That is how they defined the educational opportunity that was given.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, my surprise--my awe, if I may--was that I was able to go to Columbia University, a distinguished educational facility, which was something I never dreamed possible because of the humble roots that my family had. They gave me values--nothing of value but values. My parents' admonition throughout my life was to always be honest, always tell the truth, always work hard, and remember one thing, son: There are people as poor as we are. As difficult as it is at times, there are always  people less fortunate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My grandmother had a little bank in the house, which we shared with her many times, in which we would put small coins, to be used for--I cannot say charity but for others who were less fortunate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I stand in this Chamber at this moment, and I want to talk about something related to roots--to my roots. My father and my mother struggled to make a living. My father worked in the silk mills of Paterson, NJ, a textile city. Others like my dad and mother were brought to this country by their parents, hoping for an opportunity to make a living and to have some degree of opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My father worked in the silk mill with a dear friend of his who was later very active in union organization. My father made a plea to his foreman for a holiday off. It was an important religious holiday. He wasn't looking for any pay, Heaven forbid. He just wanted to have the time off for observance of the holiday. He and his very close friend asked the foreman if it would be all right if they took the day off for the observance of the holiday, which was the week following. The reply was very  quick: Oh, sure, you can take the day off, but don't come back to work here anymore. With that, you can imagine the view of my father and his friend not being able to continue a job that was scarce and difficult to get. So they waited, hat in hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In those days, people would wear hats to work in common labor at a mill. They described that, hat in hand, the two of them nervously waited for the owner of the company to come by. They would not let them go into the owner's office. Heaven forbid, that is no place for people like you. But the owner was a kind, generous man. When he walked out, they stopped him and explained that they desperately wanted to take the holiday off, but they needed their jobs. The owner was a kind, sympathetic person,  and he said: Take the time off, and you are going to be paid for that holiday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was the beginning days of union representation in this country--very active, very confrontational, very difficult, and sometimes violent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But my father saw and his friend saw that they had to have a better way to do things than stand hat in hand and beg for a day off. Fortunately, they found a kind man who listened and gave them the day off. But the experience was searing, and they never forgot that working people had to have representation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both of them then became active in union organization. Those were difficult days. We have all heard stories about employees who wanted some representation, wanted a voice in how they were paid, wanted a voice in what conditions were like.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My father worked in a mill. My father was a health faddist even in those days. He took very good care of himself. He was a man with muscles. He would go to the gym, and he would lift weights. He belonged to the local Y. He never smoked, was light on coffee, and no liquor. He died when he was 43 years old. He contracted cancer when he was 42. The cause was almost undeterminable, but they realized that there were materials they used when they worked with the silk to keep the silk brittle and  to keep the machinery working that ultimately caused my father's cancer. His brother died at age 56 also from cancer. Their father died at age 52 also from cancer induced by the environment at the factory in which they worked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is that people who work in places like this should have a voice--and we see disparities, such as taking 10 years to raise the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to give unions, to give working people a chance to have a voice in their work or their opportunity to take care of their families, or the opportunity, as my father said, to  hold your head high, be proud, be proud you are a worker, be proud you are contributing something to your country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we see now is distressing, which is why we are discussing freedom of choice for workers, to give them a chance have their voice heard without having to go through a hassle about whether they are organized. I have seen what happens. I ran a very big company. When I left the company, it had 16,000 employees. Today it has 40,000 employees, a company I started with 2 other poor kids from the neighborhood. We were always very conscious of our responsibility to our employees. That is why the company  was so successful. It had the longest growth of any company in American history of 10 percent or more on the bottom line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had a case in New Jersey where a bus driver was fired for being a union supporter and giving testimony to the National Labor Relations Board. Even as we gather here, we see that employers are still using all kinds of tactics to harass, threaten, or fire workers who try to exercise their right to form a union. Ninety-two percent of employers make their employees sit through one-sided, anti-union presentations, according to a study by Cornell University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Cornell study also said that 78 percent of employers have supervisors hold repeated closed-door, one-on-one meetings with workers to intimidate them to oppose the union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think those kinds of tactics are appropriate. Decent jobs are ever more scarce in this country as we ship so many jobs abroad, as technology--and I come from the computer business; I know something about technology--as technology takes jobs away from people whose only skills are manual skills, and they need a way to make a living. You don't have to be a new immigrant to need a job where you use your hands, use your body, or use your strength to make a living. But these jobs are going  further and further afield because of the technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should not allow employers to prevent workers from having a greater voice in their workplace on issues of pay and benefits and working conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can improve this situation by passing the Employee Free Choice Act to protect workers and to protect their rights--again I use the expression--hold their heads high, know they can provide for their families, know they don't have to apologize to their kids for having to work as hard as so many do, two jobs in many cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that is in front of us will let employees select a union if a majority signs cards saying they want representation. They don't want to take over the ownership of the company. They don't want to deprive senior executives from making their salaries or their benefits. When we see what is happening in America today, there is a frightening specter out there, and I talk as someone who came from the corporate boardroom. I can be accused of being a tree hugger because I care about the environment.  I can be accused of other things. But I can't be accused of not understanding what it is like to run a business, a successful business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If people want representation, when we see that there are people in this country making $1.8 billion for a single year's work, and many others earning $240 million or more. The salaries are adequate enough, as they said in an article in the New York Times a couple of weeks ago, that if you took the combined wages of people who made $240 million or more in the year, you could pay 80,000 school teachers in the city of New York for 3 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are disparities, and what has to happen is that people who work for a living have to understand their work, their effort, their contribution to the country. We have Tom Brokaw here for lunch right now. He wrote a book, "The Greatest Generation." What was it? It was working people who made the contribution. It was working people who on D-Day--I didn't arrive in Europe on D-Day; I arrived a little bit later--those who were there, those who were the heroes, those who saved their companions,  working people. They are entitled to be heard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Workers cannot be hassled or harassed to be kept from expressing their interests in a union. This bill says employees can select a union as soon as a majority signs a card saying they want  representation. Current law allows for this majority signup, but only at the employer's discretion. The employer can instead demand an election and use that time before that election to scare workers away from joining a union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Employee Free Choice Act will protect and enhance the right of workers to join a union, and there is good reason for some to choose a union. As President Bush helps the wealthy get wealthier, helps the corporations develop ever more earnings, I see nothing wrong with that as long as there is a fairness, an equity. When a company such as ExxonMobil earns almost $40 billion in a year, and Americans pull up to the pump and very often they are giving away a significant part of their purchasing  power at that gasoline pump, we have to be sure we don't totally demoralize the working people of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Union wages can help low- and middle-wage workers earn their way to new opportunities and financial stability. Everybody knows it costs more to live these days. It costs more to send a kid to college. It costs more to get health care. It costs more for gasoline. It costs more for mortgages. It costs more for everything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to make sure that the people who work for a living, who do the building, who do the lifting, are able to make a living.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it comes to wages, union wages are almost 30 percent higher than nonunion wages, and union workers are almost twice as likely to have employer-sponsored health benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, 1.3 million New Jersey residents were uninsured for health. That is 300,000 more residents than 5 years ago. Union membership can make a huge difference to them and their families. Hard-working Americans deserve these benefits. We need the Employee Free Choice Act so workers can express themselves without intimidation. They have to be certified if they make that kind of choice. But we also want employers to be accountable when they violate the law. This bill will strengthen penalties  for employer violations of the National Labor Relations Act so that employers are deterred from breaking the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Workers deserve an atmosphere where they can choose a union without intimidation or coercion. They need a strong law to allow them to make their own choice without interference from management. The Employee Free Choice Act is that law. It will give employees a stronger voice in shaping the workplace and will help employees earn more money, benefits, and improve their futures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to support this bill for New Jersey's and America's current union members and for those who want to unionize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Permit people to make their choice and make it freely and not have to be worried about intimidation or harassment. If you want to join a union, simple: Fill out a card. Why should they be deprived from doing so for their future? I don't think they should be.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, my colleagues have been very kind to me in passing on their condolences from the people of their States regarding Charleston. I publicly acknowledge all the kindness they have shown to me and Senator DeMint regarding the loss of the firefighters in South Carolina. It was a huge blow to the community of Charleston. Nine very brave souls lost their lives trying to protect their fellow citizens. Senator Kennedy spoke very eloquently of the life of a  firefighter. Senator Dodd and so many people have offered their condolences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be a memorial service tomorrow in Charleston. I will be going with other members of the delegation, and we will have a resolution before the Senate tomorrow honoring these heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I learned, talking with Senators Kennedy and Kerry, that there were six or seven firefighters lost in Worcester, MA, not that long ago. I have been told the Charleston fire was the largest loss of life among firefighters since 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who have been to Charleston, SC, know what a wonderful, beautiful community it is. It is one of the most open, welcoming communities in the country. To the families, we grieve with you. We can only imagine the pain you are going through. I hope you do realize you have so many people in your corner saying prayers for your well-being and deeply appreciative of the sacrifice your loved ones made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is human nature for most people to run away from fires. Only firemen run into them. Thank God people are willing to do that, go off and serve in the military, be policemen, EMTs, many of the other jobs that require self-preservation to take a backseat to the common good. Self-preservation is a strong instinct. I know parents would do anything for their children, and that is a very understandable emotion, taking care of your loved ones and your family. That probably trumps self-preservation--most  of the time, anyway. Doing it for somebody you don't know makes you a hero. When you are willing to give your life, risk your life for someone you don't know, that is where the term "hero" applies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the families who have lost loved ones, I do hope you have some comfort knowing that what your loved one was doing was so important. In this case, there was a belief that a civilian was left in the warehouse unaccounted for, so the firemen went back in to look for this person. Unfortunately, the worst happened. The building collapsed on them, and there was a tremendous tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are so many ways to thank firemen, and I am very inadequate in that regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similar to most young kids, I thought being a fireman was about the top of the pyramid. It seemed like the neatest job in the world. But as you get older, you realize how dangerous it is. It is one of those occupations, such as being a policeman or other occupations--but particularly firemen--that every day is a real risk you take.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the people of Charleston, SC: I know you are banded together. I know you are mourning together. You have the wishes of this body. All the Senators--Republicans and Democrats--very much have you in their prayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the families: Tomorrow will be a difficult day. It will be a very touching day. It will be a day of remembrance and mourning. It will also be a day of celebration, celebrating the lives of those brave firefighters who represent the best of my State and the best of humanity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to end this statement with the understanding that there is nothing we can do to replace your loss. But we can and we will be there by your side as you move forward.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The legislative clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the fuel economy compromise that I filed yesterday, as now amended, is a step toward addressing our energy crisis. I thank my dear friend chairman INOUYE and his staff for working across the aisle to ensure a bipartisan measure. I support the notion articulated by the President in his State of the Union Address that we need to modernize the Nation's fuel economy program, and save a significant amount of fuel over the next decade. I believe the provision we now  consider would effectuate that policy goal in a thoughtful and functional way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, our Nation stands at a crossroads in our history. The United States faces an energy crisis, but we find ourselves trapped in a vicious cycle which will only make its consequences more severe. While our Nation is blessed with enormous natural resource potential, inconsistent government policies discourage their exploration and development. As a direct result, the amount of oil imported each year is increasing, and our Federal lands, including those in my home State of Alaska, are being  withdrawn from oil and gas development and exploration. These policies have been--and will continue to be detrimental to our national security and long-term environmental economic health. The time has come for those of us in Congress, as the custodians of the public trust, to make the difficult energy policy decisions that will serve to benefit future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who advocate a one-approach-fixes-all solution are misleading the American public. The only way our Nation will achieve energy independence is through a combination of initiatives. Conservation, domestic production, and the development of alternative sources of energy are all parts of the broader solution. The end to our crisis lies in the balance between them, and the advancement of each will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One initiative without the others will simply not be enough  to achieve our energy objective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fuel economy provisions of this bill would enhance conservation. The measure would remove the legal ambiguity that for years has inhibited the Secretary of Transportation from raising fuel economy standards for passenger cars, and mandate significant fuel economy increases for both passenger cars and light trucks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By providing authority to increase standards for passenger vehicles, and challenging automobile makers to invest toward the achievement of a specific fuel economy target, this amendment would provide consumers with fuel savings at the pump, limit our Nation's dependence on foreign oil, and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am fully aware of the aggressiveness of the target standard set forth in this bill and the challenges involved with reaching the fuel economy standard for the domestic vehicle fleet. And I thank Chairman INOUYE for agreeing to allow regulatory flexibility in the event that the targets set forth by this legislation are not feasible. But the overall charge to the auto industry set forth in this measure is not unfamiliar to the industry during times of geopolitical instability. In fact,  the CAFE program was born out of very similar circumstances in 1973, during the Arab oil embargo. At the time, our Nation recognized that it was in our national interest to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of oil by demanding better fuel economy from our automobiles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the terrorist attacks waged on this country on September 11, 2001, and the  ongoing turmoil in the Middle East have brought into focus the need to reduce our dependence on all foreign oil. The United States imports almost 11 million barrels of crude oil every day, compared with only 5 million produced here at home. And more than 2 million imported barrels arrive from the Persian Gulf each day. Domestic consumption has increased since 1993 from 17 million to 21 million barrels per day. The savings achieved by increasing fuel economy standards for the entire domestic passenger  vehicle fleet is an essential component of our comprehensive strategy to increase our energy independence and national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But any change to fuel economy standards requires the careful balance of many factors, including national security, consumer preference, domestic employment, as well as the need for powerful and durable vehicles in rural America, including my home State of Alaska. While the fuel economy provisions in this amendment would set aggressive goals, they would also provide the Secretary the authority to balance these market and national security considerations, and to make the appropriate and necessary  fuel economy increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By significantly improving fuel economy in our passenger vehicle fleet, we will inherently reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While the cause of global climate change has yet to be fully determined, its speed and impacts are more evident in Alaska than anywhere in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many believe global climate change is attributable partly to manmade activities. Temperatures are rising in the Arctic region at more than twice the rate of the rest of the world, according to the 2004 Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, and many impacts in Alaska such as erosion and flooding exacerbated by climate change require immediate attention and planning of responses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, our Nation needs a new energy paradigm. The 21st century will be the proving ground for our commitment to achieve both energy independence and a clean, sustainable environment. The fuel economy provisions in the amendment address conservation and are intended as an aggressive first step of a more holistic energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current energy crisis cannot be resolved through conservation alone, and we cannot suspend the law of supply and demand while we anticipate alternative technologies and energy sources. I remain steadfast in my belief that allowing for the development of our domestic resources, particularly in my State of Alaska, is an essential component of a successful energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While my colleagues in the past have narrowly defeated efforts to effectuate that calling, I will not give up on advancing the need for such production. The development of our domestic resources would generate billions of dollars for the Federal Government, which could aid in our quest for alternative sources of energy if we use this new revenue to invest in research efforts and infrastructure development.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the Senator from Idaho very much. I say to my dear friend from a neighboring State of Nevada, we are trying--and I have had a number of conversations this afternoon with the Republican leader--to see if we can expedite the time. It is very possible that we could move forward on this legislation and not have to work the weekend because a lot of the weekend would be spent just standing around.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we can accomplish what we need to do without a lot of standing around time, we would be better off, and then we can move early next week to finish the debate on immigration. We have a limited number of items left to do. We have to finish the germane amendments. I have already indicated the managers are willing even to take a look at some nongermane amendments. We need to finish the germane amendments, and we have to have cloture on the bill if, in fact, that is required. Sometimes it isn't.  Most of the time it isn't. I said that earlier. And then we would have final passage on the bill. Then we would have 20 minutes on card check. That is the time for the vote. There would be no debate on that. I have a strong suspicion that cloture will not be invoked on that legislation. Following that, we would move to immigration.</paragraph>

It would just be we wouldn't have to be in session with people standing around guarding to make sure somebody isn't going to do something when the quorum call is on. We could wind up at the same place  and accomplish just as much. That doesn't take away how difficult it is going to be once we get on immigration.</paragraph>

If someone wants to give a speech for 10 minutes, recognizing they will speak as in morning business just for that 10-minute period, that would certainly be appropriate. But we are not going to do any  business on this bill until the managers give us some direction.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, my understanding is the floor is available for some discussion while we are waiting for the managers to work on amendments and perhaps clear amendments, and I wanted to take a few minutes along with my colleague Senator Craig to talk about some information in a piece of legislation we have previously introduced called the SAFE Energy Act, Security and Fuel Efficiency Energy Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That legislation represents legislation trying to reduce the oil intensity of the American economy. The calculation of where we are with respect to oil in this country is that we are dangerously dependent on foreign sources of oil, dangerously dependent on oil that comes from very troubled parts of the world--Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Venezuela, and more. That dependence now is over 60 percent. In other words, over 60 percent of the oil we need to run this country's economy comes from other  parts of the world, much of it very troubled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If, God forbid, tomorrow a terrorist were to interrupt the supply of oil coming to this country, our economy would be flat on its back. So how do we reduce the oil intensity in this country? Well, you do a lot of things. I mentioned that 60 percent plus of our oil comes from outside of our country. About 70 percent of the oil we use in this country is used in vehicles. So while 60 percent comes from other countries, 70 percent is running through a carburetor or fuel injector to make our vehicle  fleet go, and we are in a hopeless pursuit of becoming less dependent on foreign sources of energy if we don't make our vehicle fleet more efficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that is one. You have to make your vehicle fleet more efficient. We have just passed a piece of legislation that moves in that direction. But you need a lot of things: You need efficiency, you need conservation, you need renewable energy, you need additional production of energy; yes, even fossil fuels, but done in an environmentally acceptable way. So conservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We misuse, we waste, an enormous amount of energy in this country. The cheapest form of energy available to us is through conservation. There is no question about that. Efficiency. Almost everything we do in this country, from the time we get up in the morning until we go to bed at night, we are using all kinds of appliances that require energy. We flip on a switch and a light bulb turns on. We plug in a razor and shave and use electricity. We jump in the shower and that water is heated by electricity  or perhaps natural gas. But the fact is everything we do can be made more efficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are strange terms, such as SEER 13 standards for air conditioners. Some don't know what that means. I know it is kind of an arcane language, talking about SEER 13 standards, but it means much more efficient air conditioners. We fought for a long time about that and finally got a SEER 13 standard, and it is going to use much less electricity and be much more efficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So conservation, efficiency, renewables. The bill on the floor of the Senate is a significant piece of legislation dealing with renewable energy, solar energy, biomass, wind energy, and then the biofuels, including ethanol, biodiesel, and all of these issues that deal with renewable energy. That is another significant step toward being less dependent on foreign sources of oil. Conservation, efficiency, renewables.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there is another piece that has received too little notice, in my judgment, too little notice on the floor of the Senate, and that is additional production. We are going to use additional coal. As chairman of the Energy and Water appropriations subcommittee that funds those energy accounts, we are going to use clean power and clean coal technology to, I hope one of these days, be able to have a coal-fired electric generating plant that is a zero-emission coal-fired electric generating plant.  I believe we can get there through technology and better science. We have all these issues we are working on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to fossil fuel, coal, oil, and natural gas, we need to find additional ways to produce additional quantities of oil here as well. As I look at this issue, and my colleague Senator Craig and I have evaluated this issue, there are quantities of oil offshore--yes, in Alaska and on the west coast, in the gulf--and the largest quantity is in the Gulf of Mexico. We know we have passed some legislation in the last 2 years, within the last year and a half or so, opening up what  is called lease 181. It was modified, through the work of the Senators from Florida and others, in a way that was acceptable to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We opened up a portion of the Gulf of Mexico for additional production. Senator Craig and I believe there are additional tracts and significant tracts that can be open for additional production of oil, oil and natural gas, and that such production can be done without destruction of our environment. That production can be done by expanding the supply, which must be part of the answer to addressing this energy problem we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The oil intensity in our country makes us dangerously dependent on foreign sources of oil, and so as we look at how we deal with that, we deal with it in a lot of ways, but one of those ways must, in my judgment, include some additional production with proper and certain environmental protections. That can be done. That should be done, in my judgment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Senator Craig and I understand that portion of the plan we introduced here in the Senate that deals with offshore production is controversial. We understand when you try to do something such as that,  people come to the floor and put up a pretty vigorous fight. I might say the Presiding Officer, being from Florida, has been very active and very aggressive in protecting his State's interests, and very effective at protecting his State's interests. Both Senators from Florida have been active and involved in that. We understand that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also understand it is not likely at this point that we have the votes here in the Senate at this moment to expand the kind of production we wish to expand in the Gulf of Mexico, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be discussing and considering how at some point in the future we access those significant additional quantities of oil and natural gas our country needs, and how we access them with the kind of certain protections for our economy and our environment that would be necessary to accompany  that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why Senator Craig and I introduced a piece of legislation that has this production side to it, and we feel it has not been much discussed on the floor of the Senate. Everything else has been--conservation, efficiency, renewables--all of which I support, all of which I am excited about, all of which I think advance this country's interest, but the production side has not been discussed in as significant a way as I believe it should. So I wanted to simply take this moment to say  that the proposal offered by my colleague from Idaho and myself is one that believes that whether it is now or in the future, the construct of how we put together a comprehensive energy plan to reduce the dangerous dependence we have on foreign sources of oil must include some additional production, and the most likely place, with the greatest potential, if you look at all of the potential areas, is in the Gulf of Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor so my colleague from Idaho can express himself as well.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Idaho.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from North Dakota for a very succinct presentation about the reality of why we have spent the last couple of weeks debating energy in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is another reality check that I think most Americans fail to understand when it comes to why they are paying $3-plus at the pump, and that reality is that clearly demand in this country has outstripped supply by a significant amount. We have increasingly, since the 1950s, begun to have to  go elsewhere than just in and around our country to meet the hydrocarbon or the crude oil needs of our refiners and, ultimately, the gasoline needs of our consumers.  As that dependency has grown on foreign sources of energy, I would argue that America became increasingly less secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I am one who in the 1980s, and probably the early 1990s, thought it would be just production, production, and more production. I have changed. I have spent a lot of time looking at the energy equation of our country over the last couple of decades and said, no, you have to do a variety of different things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Production is important. Our President said we are hooked on hydrocarbons. We are "gasaholics," if you will. We are and we will be for an extended period of time. We have been there a long while. We have a multi, multibillion dollar infrastructure that supplies that energy out to the suburban access points, and you don't change those overnight. You don't change the technology that ultimately gets you there, but you do change. And America must change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some say you don't need anymore production, you can go to efficiency, you can go to new technology, and that alone will change the equation fast enough to save America's consumers and the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I disagree with that. I think we are going to go there. In fact, the Senate by a voice vote a few moments ago passed a new efficiency standard for automobiles that I support. I am a Senator who has never supported that in the 27 years I have been in the Senate. So while I may be asking the Presiding Officer from Florida to change a little bit as it relates to the resources that are offshore Florida because I now know the technologies can bring those resources out without damaging the environment,  here is a Senator who has changed also because I do believe that when you get to a fleet that burns less fuel, you are going to get to an America that needs less hydrocarbons over time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why the Senator from North Dakota and I introduced legislation earlier this year that talked about conservation, and it talked about innovation, but it also talked about production and the reality of having to get more production out of our own resources instead of relying on one of the most unstable, riskiest areas of the world to gain that production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the world were at total peace today and the world's oil supplies were managed by companies and not countries, my guess is crude would not be at $60-plus a barrel. It would be at $40-plus a barrel and the American consumer would probably be paying a dollar less at the pump. But that is not reality. Reality is reflected at the pump and therein lies one of our greatest problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier in the day, we had a great debate about a tax bill, to tax the oil companies by about $30 billion. Somehow that was going to change the equation; it was going to make the world a safer and better place. It was not going to change the price at the pump, not one dime. In fact it had the potential of taking it up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is the reason why. It did not change this equation. What is this equation? These are the known reserves of oil on the globe. Here are the big boys, as we think of them--the big companies. Here is Exxon and here is the British Petroleum and here is Texaco and over here is Marathon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You can hardly see them on the chart. They don't own the world's oil supply. They manage and own very little of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who owns it? Hugo Chavez, Venezuela--who would love to jerk this country around by its tail--Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq. I have named some of the most unstable areas of the world. They own the oil today. We need it because we are dependent on it, because we have done very little about it. That is why the Senator from North Dakota and I said we have to go where the oil is in our country, and the oil is not onshore anymore. The oil is not onshore. It is offshore. We know it is, and we know there  is a substantial supply of it. But we have allowed States to put on moratoria and establish a political environment that denies the Federal Government access to its own resources, so the taxpayers of Idaho are paying a higher price for gasoline, in part, because the State of California--the Senator from California is here, the State of Florida, and other States have said you can't drill off our shore. No. No. Even</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason you don't is because it doesn't happen anymore. The technology of today, the safety of today, the regulations of today have changed the equation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from North Dakota talked about a compromise the Senator from Florida worked with us on this past year. This is lease sale 181, where there may be millions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of gas. We don't know. There is a pretty good idea it is there and it can be produced and pushed into the current infrastructure and America, for a moment in time, will be a little bit more energy secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I am proposing and what many are talking about is what about this area? What about the rest of the eastern gulf? Ought we not be talking about that? Looking at it? Understanding what is there, if technology allows us to produce?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is where America's oil is being produced today, in the Gulf of Mexico. We are finding more and more out there as the technologies improve and as we can get deeper into the waters. That is reality. There are those who will give a lot of different arguments about why you should not do it. But I will argue you can do it and that the oil is there and America ought to know about it and they ought to be asking why we are not going there but, instead, why are we increasingly dependent upon foreign  nations for our source of oil?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a reasonable question to ask. Right now, America has grown increasingly angry because of the price it is paying at the pump. People are not accustomed to using their disposable income for the price of energy as we know it today. That is not what we have done in an economy such as ours. But that is where we are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what happens when we rely on other countries to produce our energy for us. We are at war with terrorism today around the globe. This is the French oil tanker off the coast of Yemen in October 6 of 2002, when an al-Qaida suicide boat hit it and set it afire. Here is the vulnerability of all of our oil moving on water. I suggest the ecological problems resulting from this are greater than from any drilling that could occur offshore America today because we expose ourselves to a high risk  by the shipment of oil on our ocean surfaces around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I think it is important that we keep talking and allowing America to understand we are not without oil and not without oil reserves. The progressive and environmentally sound development of them over time will help us in this period of transition that will take several decades to move to flex-fueled cars--hydrogen cars, electric cars, all of the kinds of things we think America wants and that in public policy and incentivizing the marketplace we are moving America toward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will not happen overnight. In that period of time, while it is happening, America remains extremely vulnerable. Our economy is at risk. There is no question about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I have said is this picture demonstrates something that ought to be repeated and repeated again: The weapon of mass "disruption" in this country is an al-Qaida suicide boat hitting the side of an oil tanker, time and time again. That is the weapon of mass disruption. The high risk involved, the driving up of the oil prices, the movement of gas by $2 or $3 a gallon in this economy creates havoc everywhere. Certainly, in my State of Idaho it creates tremendous problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that I and other Senators recognize that you do not conserve your way out of an energy crisis. You do not innovate your way out of an energy crisis. You do not produce your way out. You do all three.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to continue to work while I am in the Senate to encourage this  Senate in public policy to do all three. I think it is in the best interests of America, our economy, and our national security that we do so. As an American today, I am not only frustrated, I am sometimes angered and embarrassed that we, through public policy, have allowed our country to become so dependent on other parts of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Great nations should not allow that to happen, but we have. Then we make excuses all around us why we can't produce. Petropolitics is a fascinating thing. America gets it. The consumer understands it, and the consumer will grow increasingly angry when they understand that public policy doesn't allow the marketplace to do what it can do best in an environmentally sound way, to provide our country with the kind of energy it needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, as we debate this bill on the floor and finalize it, my guess is we will do a lot about conservation, we will do a lot about innovation, but we will do little to nothing about production. In the next 5 to 6 years, production is where it is. As we work on innovation, as we move technology from the laboratory to the street to commercial use, production still remains critically important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I call upon my colleagues to stand up and be counted in all three of these areas. It is important for our country. It is important for our economy. Without question, it is important for our national security. The rest of the world should not tell America what its foreign policy is or will be based on their willingness or lack thereof to produce the oil supply our economy needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from California.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate works in strange ways. I think there is no question about that. Some of us were upstairs holding a press conference on the fact that we had come together around a substitute amendment, and Senator Kerry, who had participated, came back up and said the amendment was agreed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For me, I began this in 1993, so it has been a very long time. Senator Snowe and I have worked, first, for the SUV loophole closer and then for this ten-over-ten bill for 6 years now. So it was adopted by the Senate, and there are some people I would like to thank.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to begin thanking Senator Snowe, who has been the cosponsor of this legislation--10 miles improvement in mileage efficiency over 10 years--since we started; the chairman of the committee, Senator Inouye; the ranking member, Senator Stevens; Senator Carper, who was so helpful all the way along; Senator Dorgan, who had one part of the legislation, who agreed to a change and came into the compromise; Senator Kerry, who worked very  hard with Senator Cantwell on the flex-fuel part of this; Senator Lott, Senator Corker; Senator Klobuchar; and many others. You, Mr. President, we thank you for being a cosponsor of this compromise effort as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have pushed the rock for so long I think it is hard to feel anything once the rock goes over the hill. But the amendment was adopted and it is in the base bill. For this, we are very grateful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would quickly like to say what this agreement does. It increases the fleetwide average fuel economy for all cars, SUVs, and light trucks by 10 miles per gallon over 10 years or from 25 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon by model year 2020.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, it requires the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which we call NHTSA, to establish an attribute-based system that sets mileage standards based on size, weight or type of vehicle. This is important because it creates a level playing field for all automobiles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 2011 to 2019, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration must set fuel economy standards that are the maximum feasible and ratchet these standards up, making steady progress to meet the 35-miles-per-gallon fleetwide average by 2020. The fleetwide average must be met unless NHTSA determines, based on clear and convincing evidence, that a 35-mile-per-gallon fleetwide average would not be cost effective for the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 2021 to 2030, NHTSA must set fuel economy standards that are the maximum feasible and ratchet even these standards up at a reasonable rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the agreement establishes a credit system that NHTSA would design, run, and operate. This would allow automakers to buy credits if you exceed the standard, and essentially sell those credits to those who cannot make the standards in a given year. So the credit trading program gives an automaker a financial incentive to exceed the standard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It can bank its credits also for up to 5 years. That is insurance if it falls below the standard in a later year. If an automaker cannot meet the standard in a given year, it can purchase credits, use banked credits or borrow from projected surpluses in future years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision was strongly recommended by the National Academy of Sciences in 2002. In part of the negotiation we negotiated with the two Senators from Michigan, both distinguished Senators, Ms. Stabenow and Mr. Levin. And I want to say this: There are no two Senators from any single State that I have seen fight harder for their State's industries than Senator Stabenow and Senator Levin. We could not reach an accommodation. Those of us who have watched this  fight for CAFE standards and participated in it for the last 13 years, I have just found, for me, the automobile industry has never responded. They have fought everything we have proposed every time. When this happens, when an industry is not forthcoming</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come from a huge State. We have two nonattainment pollution areas, the central valley of California and the Los Angeles area. We are having a huge problem meeting the attainment standards. If we do not, it can stop everything dead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, this, which reduces pollution, which reduces carbon dioxide, reduces global warming gases, and saves oil to the tune of 1.2 million barrels a day, is something that is going to happen when you try, try, try year after year and decade after decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very sorry we could not make an accommodation with these two Senators. But those of us who have worked on this felt so strongly that after all these years, 23 years, where Detroit has said: No, no, no, the time had come to say: Yes, yes, yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, for one, want to help with leap-ahead technology. I, for one, want to help with financing, wherever I can, to make it possible. I believe I speak for all of the cosponsors of this bill. I believe we all want to help. So I hope the next step these Senators will take is to say: Here is a bill that we want to help on, that will provide the leap-ahead technology, and here is something that would help financially the American automakers meet these standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We who have worked on this, we who asked in the early 1990s--I was the one who asked for the National Academy of Sciences study. They took a period of years to do it. We have read it. I think those of us who have been at that for so long gave up any hope that we could work with the automakers. We do not believe this will stifle the American auto industry. We believe the technology is now available, we believe it is cost effective to use this technology. It is not just based on reducing weight;  there are new materials, new engineering strategies, new types of engines that can be employed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to summarize by saying with this amendment, 206 million metric tons of carbon dioxide will not be pumped into the air in 2020; between 345 million metric tons and 428 million metric tons by 2025. We estimate savings for consumers at the pump, at $3-a-gallon gasoline, to be $55.6 billion in 2020, and $93 billion to $116 billion by 2025. As I said, oil savings of 1.2 million barrels per day, or 438 million barrels per year in 2020, and between 2 and 2 1/2  million barrels per day by 2025.  That is about what we import from the Middle East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank everybody who participated. There are some of those Senators on the floor. I want to particularly thank Senator Cantwell for her efforts on flex fuel. She is extraordinarily knowledgeable. She is also determined. She  perseveres. Her amendment was added as a modification to the amendment that passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senator Carper for his steadfast help. The Senator from Delaware has been there every step of the way, in every meeting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of all, I thank the chairman of the Commerce Committee. What can I say about this chairman? Well, I can begin by saying how lucky we are to have you, Dan Inouye. You run a fine committee. We are so grateful for your leadership in this matter. I do not believe it would have happened had you not, A, been chairman of the committee; B,  been committed to this legislation; C, wanted us to come together and find a solution. You were so right, because we did come together, and the solution happened quicker than any of us might guess.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to, if I might, thank your staff. David Strickland is a technological wizard on this. He also has the dedication. He is sitting here today. I know he has worked very long hours. But we are very grateful for his help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I say thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would be remiss if I did not thank my staff, particularly John Watts, who has been with us for some time, as my environmental counsel, and has worked on this issue; and Matthew Nelson, who is new to our staff, but came in and got his feet wet very fast. I am very grateful to both of them as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Bill Nelson as a cosponsor to this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>I know others want to speak. This is one of the great days in the Senate. When you work on something for a long time, and you find yourself cut out year after year, you are determined you are going to persevere to find new ways to do it, and for Senator Snowe and for me, it is a very special day. I thank everyone for making it possible for all of us in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Delaware is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300019" topic="">
    <paragraph>While Senator Feinstein is still on the floor, I would tell her: In my life, as I have had a chance to meet great leaders in this country and in other places, other countries, in all walks of life, I have taken over the years to asking those leaders: To what do you attribute your success--whether they happen to be a leader in business or academia or government. More often than not they say to me, among other things, I work hard. They also say: I don't give up. I don't give  up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my colleague Senator Feinstein, to my colleague Olympia Snowe: You do not give up. And we are going to be a better country, a country less dependent on foreign oil because of those efforts, a country with a cleaner environment, a country and a world less threatened by global warming because of your efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are smart, we will pull together and find ways to make sure this legislation, rather than being the death knell for the auto industry in this country, can be like a second wind and help to restore us to the kind of vigor we once enjoyed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you very much. Thank you for your kindness in giving so many other people credit. I echo Senator Feinstein's comments with respect to our staffs, committee staff, and there are a bunch of them sitting back here. David and the first team are back here. I want to say you have done a remarkable job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been in the Senate for 7 years. This is my first year on the Commerce Committee. I have never seen staff as helpful, Democratic and Republicans, like one team working together, and Beth Osborne, who works on my personal staff, continues to rave about the great support we get from the committee staff. I think they key off Senator Inouye, our chairman, and Senator Stevens, the senior Republican. It is a wonderful kind of relationship, the way this place ought to work. When  it does, we get the kind of results I hope we are going to get with respect to fuel efficiency for our cars, trucks, and vans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe it was Thomas Edison who said, and I am going to paraphrase Thomas Edison, that: Sometimes people miss opportunity. And they miss opportunity because it comes wearing overalls and looks a lot like work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is opportunity in the legislation we are prepared, I believe, to pass with respect to fuel efficiencies for our cars, trucks, and vans. I think there is an opportunity here for the U.S. domestic auto industry. We have to help make sure that opportunity is not missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have all seen the Home Depot commercials where the folks from Home Depot say: You can do this; we can help. And with respect to meeting the goal of 35-miles-per-gallon fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks by 2020, that is an aggressive goal. But for the auto industry, Ford, GM, and Chrysler, it is important for us to be there to help them to meet that goal. If you look closely at the legislation we are preparing to pass here in the next--maybe tonight, maybe in the next day or two--if  you look at the legislation, there is a variety of ways where we do help. I will mention a few of those now, if I might.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of those is the infusion of Federal dollars in research and development with respect to new battery technology. The coolest car I saw at the Detroit auto show in January of this year was a Chevrolet. It is called a Chevrolet Volt. It is a flex-fuel plug-in hybrid vehicle. The mileage it will get is probably close to 75, 80, 90 miles per gallon. You plug it in your garage at night, go out the next day, drive 40 miles or so on the battery, push on the brakes, and recharge the battery. But also  it comes with an auxiliary battery unit. It can be biocell, it could be flex-fuel diesel, it could be flex-fuel ethanol powered, internal combustion engine, recharging the battery and getting this remarkable fuel economy from what I call an elegant solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the kind of creativity we have in this country; not just Chevrolet, not just Ford, not just Chrysler, but all of us together, working together. It is a wonderful concept, as that car is. It is not going to be a reality in 2010 or 2011 or 2012 if we don't have the next generation lithium ion battery to be able to plug in the garage at night and provide the kind of charge to carry us 30, 40 miles the next day, plug it in at work, and on and on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have an opportunity, I think we have an obligation as the Federal Government, to make sure tax dollars are appropriately spent. Fifty million dollars a year at least for the next 5 years goes to help fund the technologies so that vehicle and other flex-fuel plug-in hybrid vehicles can be built and get us, if not ahead of the rest of the world, at least at the starting line with them as we begin this next part of the race, the competitive race for market share in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One way we can help within the Federal Government is through our R&amp;D investment. A second way we can help is by using our Federal purchasing power to commercialize these new technologies as they come to market. We do that in this legislation in one way, by calling for the development of major steps toward a game plan as early as 2009 for the Federal Government to use its purchasing power to buy new technology, highly energy-efficient vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the underlying language of this bill, it actually says that 70 percent, up to 70 percent of the vehicles that GSA, General Services Administration, purchases on the civilian side for the Federal Government have to be highly energy efficient, next-generation kind of technology--70 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a week or two we are going to take up legislation on the reauthorization of the Defense bill. If we are smart, we will put a similar kind of requirement in there for the defense side of our Government to do what we are preparing to do in this legislation for the civilian side of our Government in terms of purchasing power, to say to the Department of Defense, when they go to the marketplace and they are buying cars, trucks, and vans, and they buy a lot of them, to make sure that early in the  next decade maybe 70 percent of what we are purchasing on the defense side is these new technology energy-efficient, low-emission vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a smart thing to do. That is the second thing we can do, use the Federal Government's purchasing power to commercialize new technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third thing we can do is make sure our tax policy marries up with the goals we are setting for more highly energy-efficient, low-emission vehicles.  In 2005, we passed legislation that said when people buy hybrid-powered vehicles, they can earn a tax credit from about $300 to up to $3,500. That tax credit brings down the cost of the energy-efficient hybrid vehicles and encourages people to buy them. Unfortunately, most of the hybrids people are buying  these days happen to be built in other countries. That is going to change very soon, as GM product comes on the market. Chrysler product comes on the market early next year, and we will have the opportunity to buy not just hybrid vehicles built in other countries but a lot of hybrids built here. We have a Tax Code that is set to infuse and encourage American consumers to buy those vehicles as soon as they hit the road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is also a provision in the 2005 Energy bill that incentivizes consumers to buy low-emission, highly efficient diesel-powered vehicles. The full effect of that will not be felt until 2009. But Chrysler, in a partnership with DaimlerChrysler, is beginning to bring to the roads a highly energy-efficient, far lower emission diesel that increases performance by 40 percent or more in terms of fuel efficiency. It reduces the emission of bad stuff, including CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2, into the air. Beginning in 2009, when emissions really go down on diesel, the tax policy is there to incentivize folks to buy those vehicles. That is a smart thing to do. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fourth area we tried to work into this legislation--and we need to do more--deals with the kind of infrastructure we have for folks who buy fuel cell-powered vehicles in this decade and the next. We don't have a hybrid highway. It is not as if you can take your fuel cell vehicle and go to the corner gas station and fill up, even in this city or its neighboring States. We in the Federal Government have an obligation, particularly if we want to encourage people to get into fuel cell-powered  vehicles, hydrogen-powered vehicles, to make sure the infrastructure is there so people can fill up. The same is true with biodiesel, ethanol. It is no good for us to have vehicles run on biodiesel or ethanol if there is no place to fill up. We tried, in the context of this legislation, to fix that problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure our present Presiding Officer remembers when we were trying to get folks to buy unleaded cars powered by unleaded gas. Finally, we said: Every gas station has to have at least one pump where you can get unleaded gas. We made it a mandate. Today it is hard to find a gas pump that has leaded gas. But it took a while to do that. We need a similar kind of approach with respect to biofuels and ethanol, not that they would supplant completely the petroleum products--that is not going to happen  any time soon--but to make sure people have the fuel to meet the kinds of needs of their vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those are four things we can do in the context of this legislation. We are going to find ways to do more. The best way to do that is to ask the auto industry: How can we help? We want you to meet these goals. We realize you think they are maybe difficult to achieve, some would say impossible to achieve. I don't think so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the United States of America. This is the Nation which invented cars. This is the Nation which invented airplanes. This is the Nation which invented televisions and CD players. This is the Nation which invented the Internet, computers. This is the Nation which unleashed the power of the atom. This is the Nation which put a man on the Moon, did it in less than 10 years, when we said we were going to do it. This is the United States of America. We are creative, hard working. We are smart.  If we are really smart, we will find a way to make this new approach to fuel efficiency for our cars, trucks, and vans work; to make it work for the domestic auto companies as well as for others who come to our shores; to make it work for the shareholders</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Florida.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Feinstein for her quest over a number of years and thank all of our colleagues on the Commerce Committee, Members and staff, for bringing this possibility about. It came about as a result of the other side not having the votes. All they had to get was 41 votes. Fortunately, that did not occur. It allowed us to come together and massage the bill a little bit more with these amendments. Thus, we get the end result.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Senator has filed an amendment for 40 miles per gallon. It simply wasn't practical. We weren't going to have the votes for that because we were trying hard enough to get the votes for 35 miles a gallon in 13 years, in 2020, and then with the compromises that were made, instead of thereafter being at a 4-percent increase in miles per gallon per year, which would compound, leaving it to NHTSA, with the criteria of what is practically feasible. That is a reasonable compromise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then totally apart from that, on a separate issue, flex-fuel vehicles, wherever we can encourage that, it is certainly to our advantage because the more we can have a fuel that is something other than derived from oil, the better off we are. If we have the vehicles that use E85, then the question is, Do we have the gas stations that have the ethanol distributed to them in order to get E85? We have to start working on that. As a matter of fact, in my State of Florida, we have one company that  is seriously thinking about ethanol plants all over the State so that it could then have the ability to get the ethanol distributed to the gas stations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the chairman of the Commerce Committee is here, I  wanted to say, in handing out all of these congratulations, under his leadership, under his tutoring, under his mentoring, and under his encouragement, he has allowed the committee to come forth with this work product that is a signal achievement. Now if we can get the Energy bill passed on final passage and then if we can survive the process, if the House can pass an energy bill, in conference committee, then, of course, if we can survive not having a veto by the President, this is all doable  now because we are where we are thanks to the leadership of the chairman of the Commerce Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to make another comment on another subject in response to my colleagues, Senator Dorgan and Senator Craig from Idaho. Senator Craig puts up a chart there as if all the oil in the United States is in the Gulf of Mexico off of Florida. That is not what the geology says. To the contrary, over the last 50 years where they have drilled, they have come up with a number of dry holes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was why last year this Senator was willing to compromise for those who wanted a lease sale called 181 that basically had boiled down to about 2 million acres, to be able to expand that to 8.3 million acres but to keep it away from the coastline of Florida, where we happen to have a $50 billion-a-year tourism industry that depends on pristine beaches, but equally as important, that kept it away from the military mission line, which is the edge of the largest testing and training area in the  world for our military. It is there where we are doing significant testing of weapons systems and new sophisticated technology, often with live ordnance. Over and over, the Secretary of Defense has issued letters and said: You can't drill in this area because oil rigs are incompatible with live fire and testing of live ordnance on new weapons systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Craig in his comments would have us believe the answer is drill, drill, drill. By his chart, he was suggesting drilling off the coast of Florida. That simply is not true. It is interesting that he said that at the very time in which we are on this Energy bill through which we are now doing something about lessening the consumption of oil by the amendment we just adopted, an amendment that goes to the very heart of where we consume most of our oil, and that is in the transportation  sector. Where in transportation is it most consumed? It is in our personal vehicles. Thus, we are doing something about that tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to add these comments while we are still on the Energy bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in support of the Employee Free Choice Act, <bill type="s" number="1041">S. 1041</bill>. This bill was introduced by our esteemed colleague, Senator Kennedy, along with myself and 45 other Members of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill takes the long overdue step of returning to workers a measure of negotiating power and ensuring that workers have a free choice and fair chance to form a union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone needs an agent, and for too long workers have not had an agent in the Congress or, in many cases, in the workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bargain this country has promised workers--that if you work hard, you will get ahead--is broken. Hard-working Americans are losing ground. Real wages are lower today than in 1973, despite the fact that productivity has risen over 80 percent. The benefits of rising productivity are going to the richest members of our society. CEO compensation today is 420 times what it is for our workers. Medical costs have skyrocketed. Good manufacturing jobs are being sent overseas. Many workers are squeezed  between the impact of corporate outsourcing on the one hand and wage-depressing effects of immigration on the other. In Virginia, real median hourly wages fell by 3.6 percent just in the past 2 years. Hundreds of thousands of Virginians, just like millions of Americans, have no health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I heard so often during my campaign for the Senate last year and what I continue to hear since I took office, our workers are under tremendous pressure. Only 38 percent of the public says their families are getting ahead financially, and less than one-third believes the next generation of Americans is going to be better off than this generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our unions have historically provided a ladder for workers to get ahead. According to a national survey by Peter Hart Research, 60 million Americans report, right now, they would join a union if they could. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that workers who belong to unions earn 30 percent more than their nonunion counterparts and are 63 percent more likely to have employer-provided health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, many workers who try to form unions in this country are being blocked by employers. In an analysis of union organizing drives in Chicago, the University of Illinois found that 30 percent of employers tended to fire prounion workers, that 82 percent of employers hired consultants to fight union organization drives, and that 78 percent of employers required supervisors to deliver antiunion messages to their workers. Union membership in this country is now at an alltime low, just  comprising 12 percent of our workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ability to form a union should not require heroic efforts. Yet American workers all too often face employer coercion and run the risk of losing their livelihoods simply because they want to organize their workplace in accordance with existing law. Hard-working Americans should have the freedom to make their own choice about whether to join a union, and they should be able to make that choice freely and fairly. The best opportunity for hard-working Americans to get ahead is to join their coworkers  and negotiate in one way or another for better wages and benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can help workers improve their bargaining position. The National Labor Relations Act already permits workers to form unions through majority signup. In fact, more workers join unions through majority signup than through National Labor Relations Board elections. Employees of Cingular Wireless joined the Communications Workers of America following a majority signup that was supported by the company.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill makes the much needed change of allowing workers to form unions by majority signup where employers oppose the union. This bill also levels the playing field for workers by strengthening penalties against employers that coerce or intimidate employees. The fundamental sense of fairness that runs so deep in our Nation's character demands that we take this step on behalf of our working men and women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us measure our success in the Senate by the number of hard-working Americans we bring back to the table, the number of families with health care, the number of workers with pensions and fair wages, and the number of children who are able to go to college. Passing the Employee Free Choice Act puts us on the road to achieving this type of success.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Washington.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300018" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise tonight because we are on the precipice of passing new energy legislation--new energy legislation that will point our country in a new direction, on an energy strategy that is about cleaner, renewable alternative fuel, and, yes, on research and development, on many other ways that will help us, as Americans, be energy leaders again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is exciting to be here tonight on the Senate floor as new legislation is being adopted that does change the direction in ways my colleagues have been fighting for many years and many of the staff who are behind me have been fighting for much of their legislative careers on the Hill. But we are here tonight because Senator Reid, early this year, asked six different committees to come up with energy legislation and point our country in a new direction. He asked each of those committees  to put those proposals on the Senate floor by passing them out in a bipartisan fashion, and those committees have done so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, while we have not gotten all those packages together, we do have a proposal before us that would save the United States 20 percent on the oil consumption of today. That is a great goal. It does it in two fundamental ways: by making sure we produce alternative fuel--and what is before us tonight is 36 billion gallons of alternative fuel, mostly done by advanced technologies of cellulosic that will be a much bigger reduction of CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 emissions than corn-based ethanol, and that is a huge direction change--and the amendment of the Senator from California to make sure we have fuel-efficient cars. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the first time in decades, we are passing legislation that will allow Americans to get more out of a tank of gas. In fact, with this new standard for fuel efficiency, Americans, when they fill up their tank, will be able to go anywhere from 100 to 150 more miles on that tank of gas when these fuel efficiency standards are fully implemented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because we are also including a flex-fuel provision, we are giving Americans a chance to have their automobiles run on two different fuel choices: fossil fuel or new advanced green renewable fuels that will be a great reduction of CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 and carbon emissions and will help in the reduction of demand for gasoline and thereby help lower the price of gasoline. This is exactly what America wants us to do in a new energy direction. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should also emphasize that the underlying bill tonight also has protections for consumers on price gouging and to make sure the Federal Trade Commission stops any manipulative practices. It also has a provision that the Federal Government do its job as one of the leading energy consumers in America. It says they have to use 30 percent less electricity and 20 percent less fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, while I would like to see the provisions the Finance Committee passed that literally take the incentives which have been given to the fossil fuel industry in the past--take those and apply those to renewable technologies--we will have to wait another day for that battle to occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I certainly join my colleagues in wanting to see more of our electricity grid supplied with green energy technology, to incentivize solar, to incentivize wind. I believe this is one of the best ways we can keep our electricity costs down in the future. Right now, we are too dependent on natural gas, for which we have seen a 70-percent increase in the last several years. Natural gas, which is also used in fertilizer as a product, is putting pressure on our electricity grid prices. We do not want  to be just dependent on natural gas and coal for electricity generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So coming back to this renewable standard and getting more of our national grid to rely on clean energy is very important to help consumers keep down price in the future. But those two provisions, we will have to come back to. We were not able to reach agreement on those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in this landmark legislation, we are going to give Americans more for their tank of gas by passing fuel efficiency and passing the opportunity to fill up their gas tank with something other than fossil fuel. Driving down the price of fossil fuel is a great accomplishment. We would not have gotten here if it was not for the chairman of the Commerce Committee and the ranking member, Senators Inouye and Stevens, who worked very hard to make sure this was bipartisan legislation,  as did Senator Snowe, working with Senator Feinstein, making sure this legislation made it the full way through the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this is only the Senate taking action tonight, we are clearly turning our country in a new direction. This is a greener energy bill than the Senate has passed before but rightly so because the 2005 bill did set us on a course of making sure we were investing in alternatives. The fact that we were putting a downpayment on those alternatives has led to job creation, not just in my State, Washington State, but throughout the country. But it is time for us to accelerate that, to bring job opportunities  to Americans across the country, by making sure these new technologies are implemented. We are well poised to do that tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues understand the significance of this new energy direction. I thank all of the chairs of the various committees who have worked hard on a bipartisan basis--the Finance Committee, the EPW Committee, the Energy Committee, the Commerce Committee, and even the Homeland Security Committee--in making sure our Federal Government is more energy efficient. This is a great time for us to continue the bipartisan effort in working not just across the aisle but working with the House of  Representatives in making sure this energy legislation passes as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I applaud the great work of my colleague, Senator Feinstein, for her perseverance over at least 10 years in trying to close the loopholes that have existed in CAFE, the car efficiency standards, by making sure the loopholes for SUVs were closed. Even though she did not win that battle, she persevered tonight to make sure this new efficiency standard, applied across the Nation, can bring real savings to American consumers.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="CRISIS IN DARFUR">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, for the last several months, I have come to the floor on a weekly--a regular basis--to remind my colleagues about the crisis in Darfur. I would like to highlight two recent developments. Last week, the regime in Sudan finally agreed, after months of international pressure, to accept a joint African Union-United Nations peacekeeping force for the Darfur region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If my colleagues will recall, this is a region where our Government has declared a genocide. We know at least 200,000 people, maybe 400,000 people, have been brutally murdered, over 1 million have been displaced, and the killing and displacement, the raping and the pillaging continues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For years after the declaration of this genocide, many people around the world have lamented this tragic state of affairs, but so little has been done. We have tried through the United Nations to send a peacekeeping force to protect innocent people from the jingaweit militia force that is killing on a wanton basis, but we have been unsuccessful. There has been resistance from the Sudanese Government in Khartoum. Unfortunately, a lot of lip service has been made, but very little attention has  been paid to resolving this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week the Sudanese said they would accept a joint African Union-United Nations peacekeeping force for that region. Well, the Government of Sudan has agreed to allow 17,000 to 19,000 troops. That is a good sign, or at least good words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's not forget the Sudanese regime has agreed to similar plans in the past, only to renege on its promises and allow the suffering and killing to continue. It is critical at this moment in time that the Bush administration and our allies continue to pressure the Sudanese to take actions beyond their words. Darfur has been on the agenda for the European Union summit this week, and the Chinese Government made positive statements as well. I encourage the Bush administration to keep pressuring  all of our allies and the United Nations to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week there is a prime opportunity. Secretary of State Rice has just announced plans to attend an international meeting in France that will focus on the crisis in Darfur. Representatives from the Chinese Government and other places have committed to join her. I urge the Bush administration to use this opportunity to ensure that the global community continues to act on this crisis and to fully support the rapid and full deployment of U.N. forces to Darfur. Only a unified message from the international  community will succeed in convincing the Sudanese Government to meet its obligations. Only then will the crisis begin to come to an end. This crisis must end immediately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have said on this floor many times that as a young college student, I found it hard to understand how the Holocaust could occur and people would know of it and not try to stop it. Now I understand. This genocide in Darfur was declared by our Government years ago and little or nothing has been done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, the United Nations World Food Programme did launch a highly complex operation to try to bring in emergency food supplies to the over 2,600 refugees from Darfur who recently crossed into the remote northeast corner of the Central African Republic. The Director of the World Food Programme and the Central African Republic, Jean-Charles Dei, said the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These people are in one of the least accessible regions in the world, but they need help now. This is just the latest example of how the conflict in Darfur has a destabilizing effect across the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is certainly positive that food is on the way to these starving refugees, but the need for this airlift is symbolic of how bad the crisis has become and how destabilizing the situation is becoming for the whole region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States and civilized nations around the world who acknowledge this genocide and this humanitarian disaster must act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What can we do in the Senate? As a start, we can pass the Sudan Disclosure and Enforcement Act. I introduced it 2 weeks ago with bipartisan support, and after consultation with the Bush administration. The act provides the administration and all Americans with more resources and information so that we can use our investments as individuals and as institutions to strike a nonviolent blow for peace in Darfur. It creates real financial consequences for those companies that bear some complicity in  the bloodshed by supporting the murderous Sudanese regime of Khartoum. Most important, it requires members of the administration and the relevant congressional committees to meet in about 3 months' time to reassess the steps that are being taken to end the crisis and decide what we should do beyond them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To repeat what the bill does for the benefit of my colleagues who are considering supporting it, here is a summary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it expresses the sense of the Congress that the international community should continue to bring pressure against the Government of Sudan to convince that region that the world will not allow this crisis to continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, it authorizes greater resources for the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Department of Treasury to strengthen its capabilities of tracking Sudanese economic activity and pursuing sanctions violations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, it requires more detailed SEC disclosures by U.S.-listed companies that operate in the Sudanese petroleum sector so that investors can make informed decisions regarding divestment from these companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might add that during the course of researching this issue, I learned that my own company that I have had my family mutual fund investments with  for 20  years sadly was one of the largest--it was a company with one of the largest holdings in Petrochina, the Chinese oil company whose parent company does the most business in Sudan. I contacted this major company, asked them if they were going to change their policy, and they said no. I then removed my investments from that company. I am in the process of making sure they are all transferred to another company. It is a small thing, and it probably won't make a big difference to anyone, but I feel  better that at least I am trying to do a small part--and I hope others will too--to ask important questions, whether your brokerage house, your mutual fund has holdings in Petrochina, which is this Chinese oil company whose parent is the major oil company in Sudan whose revenues support this Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, this bill dramatically increases civil and criminal penalties for violating American economic sanctions to create a true deterrent against transacting with barred Sudanese companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifth, it requires the administration to report on the effectiveness of current sanctions and recommend additional steps to Congress to end the crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with Chairman Chris Dodd of Connecticut, the chairman of the Banking Committee, to send this to the President for his signature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will repeat again what President Bush said in April:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You who have survived evil know that the only way to defeat it is to look it in the face and not back down. It is evil we are now seeing in Sudan--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush said--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>and we're not going to back down. &lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I completely agree with President Bush's remarks. The African Union and the United Nations forces should be on the way soon, but we still must do more. Every Member of Congress and everyone interested in doing something meaningful to end this genocide must take action and not allow this to continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President once said he didn't want the moral burden of this genocide on his conscience, on his watch. The President's watch is coming to a close. It is time for those of conscience and those who care not only in our Government, but around the world, to act to spare those who are victims of this genocide in Darfur.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President. I rise today to speak on the successful adoption, moments ago, of the Stevens Amendment, which I have cosponsored. Its incorporation into the underlying bill clears the way for passage of the most significant fuel efficiency legislation the Senate has seriously considered in decades. If this legislation is eventually adopted by the full Congress, it will be the first time since 1975 that effective fuel efficiency legislation will have been enacted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, I want to thank my good friend and colleague, Senator Dianne Feinstein, for her unrivaled leadership on the issue of fuel economy standards. We have worked together for 6 years to bolster CAF&#xC9; standards and her commitment and passion for implementing critical and long-overdue changes has only grown. Our efforts have culminated this year in the introduction of the Ten in Ten Fuel Economy Act, which is the key component of the underlying energy bill that currently sits  before the Senate. All of us in this fight can be deeply appreciative of her voice and her tireless advocacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to express my deepest appreciation to Senator Ted Stevens, the author of this amendment, who has shown strong resolve on this issue by working to forge a compromise in the face of obstacles that often seemed insurmountable. I likewise want to thank and commend he chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Inouye, who has been instrumental both as an original cosponsor of the "Ten in Ten" bill and in deftly shepherding this bill through his committee and on the  floor. Both gentlemen have again demonstrated that compromise is possible in this body and, without their bridge building, this day would not have been possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Likewise, I want to recognize the principled leadership of Senators Lott, Carper, Alexander, Dorgan, Kerry, Cantwell, Klobuchar, Craig, all of whom have been critical in arriving at the consensus fuel efficiency legislation which we have before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate now stands at a landmark moment. Thirty-two years have passed since Congress last took action on fuel economy standards, dating all the way back to 1975. It has been an entire generation since we said that--as a Nation--we can and must do better when it comes to saving fuel, saving money at the pump, and saving our environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a lot of catching up to do. From 1985--the last time fuel economy standards were administratively increased for passenger vehicles--not by Congress, mind you, but administratively--oil imports have increased substantially from 4.3 million barrels a day to 13.8 million barrels a day, while our efficiency standards have virtually been stagnant. Indeed, over the past 25 years, fuel economy standards in the "light truck" category have only increased by a measly 4.7 miles per gallon--that's  an average of two-tenths of a gallon improvement every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me repeat that--it's taken a quarter of a century to wring a grand total of an additional 4.7 miles per gallon out of light trucks--which currently include SUVs--for a current average of just 22.2 mpg. Meanwhile, think about this--in that same period of time since 1982, we have gone from land-lines to cell phones, from record players to CDs to Ipods, from big mainframe computers to minuscule handhelds, from encyclopedias to the Internet. So are we really to believe that over the next 10 years  we can't manage an average of 10 additional miles per gallon of gasoline across America's entire fleet of passenger vehicles?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, as a Nation built on innovation, built on the "can-do" spirit, we ought to be asking ourselves exactly how it is we couldn't have done better already--never mind questioning if we can do better in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why Senator Feinstein and I introduced legislation 6 years ago to close the SUV loophole, whereby SUVs were exempt from increased fuel efficiency requirements because they were classified as light trucks. It's also the reason we introduced this year a bipartisan measure to raise the average fuel economy standards for all vehicles, including SUVs, from a combined 25 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon by model year 2020.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I will explain more in-depth, this legislation was carefully crafted to reflect not what we wish we could achieve, but what we know we can actually achieve. And I'm pleased that mandate was embraced and passed in the Senate Commerce Committee; now, it is vital that this provision in the underlying bill be preserved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we have heard mischaracterizations of this measure--there have been omissions when it comes to describing this bill from those who oppose this measure--so let me just begin by stating plainly what this bill will do. Let me repeat, it requires that the average fuel economy standard for all vehicles under 8,500 pounds reach 35 miles per gallon by model year 2020. This bill has no such requirement for vehicles over 8,500 pounds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to those vehicles, we allow the Secretary of EPA and Energy to determine an appropriate fuel efficiency improvement program. Again, there are no specific mandates for vehicles over 8,500 pounds--just a direction that the standards are set at the maximum feasible level--we assign no numerical goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, we preserve the separate standard for fuel efficiency or the existing light truck category until 2011--recognizing that our manufacturers already have these vehicles in the works for the next three model years and it would be impossible, as a practical matter, for them to reengineer those vehicles at this juncture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After 2011, there will no longer be separate categories for light trucks and passenger vehicles, as the legislation switches to a fleet-wide standard based  on vehicle attributes such as weight, as I just described. The world has already adopted this system because it is the most efficient framework. In fact, Taiwan, Japan, China, and South Korea have all established an attribute-based system that is either based on size of the engine or the weight of  the vehicle. Now, the U.S. Congress must expand the framework of our attribute-based system to a structure that does not distinguish between passenger cars and light trucks but that does create an efficient and logical system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me emphasize, this is a change that automakers themselves have sought, because it provides them greater flexibility and choices across product lines to achieve the overall goal of a fleet-wide fuel efficiency standard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me elaborate on that point. Not only will manufacturers no longer have to contend with specific CAF&#xC9; targets for specific vehicle segments, they won't even have to meet a specific target for their specific company. So how do we achieve the goal? That will be up to NHTSA to determine--not Congress--which is yet another change that the auto industry has sought.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, the industry has asked that the arbitrary and artificial lines between vehicle categories be eliminated; this bill does so. Even the alternative amendment filed by my friend and colleague, the junior Senator from Arkansas, also incorporates our "attribute-based" approach precisely because that's what the industry is seeking. The industry has also asked that the experts--and not Congress--determine specifically how fuel economy standards are met, and by placing those decisions  in the hands of NHTSA this bill does so on that score as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is, our bill provides our car companies with the flexibility they require. It doesn't place a mandate on vehicles over 8,500 pounds. It absolutely will not mean the end of light trucks. That is a red herring, Mr. President, and as I will detail in a few moments, the experts tell us that an additional 10 miles per gallon in 10 years over the entire American fleet of passenger vehicles is achievable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, there are some who argue that Congress shouldn't even be in the business of setting these fuel economy requirements. Well, first of all, let's look back at what happened the last time Congress became involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the wake of the 1973 oil crisis, Congress delivered a long-term significant increase in CAF&#xC9; standards, which the New York Times has labeled as the most successful energy-saving measure this country has ever seen. The congressional challenge in 1975 worked to reduce our Nation's demand for energy. Does anyone seriously believe that the fuel economy for America's vehicles would have improved by 40 percent from 1978 to 1985--just a seven year period--if Congress hadn't stepped in? And just  imagine where we'd be today if our energy independence efforts hadn't been dormant for the past 22 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, there should be no question of the critical national security component to reducing our dependence on foreign oil. Every day, we import 2.1 million barrels of oil from the Persian Gulf. Every day, our rising gas prices shift billions of dollars from the American consumer to authoritarian governments in some of the most volatile regions of the world. Reflecting the critical involvement of energy security in our national security, an organization called the Energy Security Leadership  Council has formed in an effort to advance a fundamental shift of our national energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Energy Security Leadership Council is a nonpartisan organization that aims to build bipartisan support for policies to reduce  our Nation's dependence on foreign oil and improve our energy security. The Council is cochaired by Frederick W. Smith, chairman, president, and CEO of FedEx Corporation, and Retired General P.X. Kelley, the 8th Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. The Membership consists of generals, admirals, and a former Secretary of the Navy. These are prominent, experienced, and highly credible leaders who understand the consequences of a reliance of foreign oil. The Energy Security Leadership Council has  recommended for increasing fuel economy standards, and has endorsed this bill before us. They understand that our Nation must finally curtail our energy demand from these volatile regions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Smith testified just last week before the Senate Small Business Committee on the impact of rising gas prices. Noting that most oil shipments pass through a handful of maritime chokepoints such as the Suez Canal and the Strait of Hormuz, Mr. Smith observed that "a mere 4 percent shortfall in global daily oil supplies could push the price of oil to more than $120 per barrel." What's the solution? According to the Energy Security Leadership Council, it is the bill before us today. Mr. Smith  testified that "the Senate has made great strides . . . through bipartisan support for" the Ten-in-Ten bill. Mr. Smith further applauded our bill's use of an attribute-based system, noting that "[t]his focus on attributes will also ensure that Americans will still be able to purchase different types of vehicles that cater to different transportation needs." He concluded, "This is truly path-breaking legislation that merits broad support."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, General Kelly has recently articulated, "Current events only serve to confirm the unacceptable security risks created by our extraordinary level of oil dependence. Significantly, reducing the projected growth in U.S. oil consumption must become a compelling national priority." We ought to heed General Kelly's assessment and protect American security. I ask my colleagues, since when should Congress excuse itself from issues of vital national security?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the 2002 National Academy of Sciences report stated, the trade-offs on these vital matters "rightly reside with elected officials". Furthermore, they also conclude that it is "appropriate for the Federal Government to ensure fuel economy levels beyond those expected to result from market forces alone." So we ought to get beyond the question of the proper role for Congress in this debate. We have an indispensable and undeniable role to play.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there are some who are concerned that we will inadvertently limit consumer choice, and let me say emphatically that we address those concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1978 to 1985 vehicles did not disappear from the road and during that period we witnessed a 40 percent increase in fuel economy. In fact, I would argue the American consumer finally had the opportunity to purchase the more fuel efficient cars they wish they had years earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But most importantly, let me reiterate this bill before the Senate does not mandate a certain fuel economy for any specific type of vehicle. Rather, it ensures that all of America's vehicles improve, in the aggregate, to the 35 mile per gallon standard while leaving the specifics on how to attain that requirement to the experts at the Department of Transportation and, specifically, the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration. As a result, the engineers and economists at NHTSA are empowered  to ensure that we accomplish the oil savings in the most efficient mechanism. And what does this mean for consumer choice?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because the bill doesn't mandate particular fuel economy targets for any specific category of passenger vehicle, there is greater flexibility in how the 35 mpg mandate can be reached. For example, the Secretary of Transportation may decide that pick-up trucks can't realistically achieve any substantial gains, but other segments have that capacity. Manufacturers will have greater latitude in how they contribute to the attainment of the overall target of 35 mpg. So this bill will not remove any  vehicles from the road, but it will abate the sting at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our approach in this bill also addresses another concern we share--that increased fuel efficiency doesn't translate to unaffordable sticker prices on America's new vehicles. Figuring in the cost-savings based on $1.50 per gallon of gas, the 2002 NAS study outlined that any initial cost in additional technology that saves gasoline would be recovered over the life of the vehicle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, with fuel costs now more than double that amount, it's logical to assume the savings on fuel costs of more efficient vehicles will be even greater. In fact, even at $2.00 per gallon, the net consumer savings would be $20 billion in 2020. In short, as the Congressional Research Service summarizes the NAS report, it "concluded  that it was possible to achieve more than a 40 percent improvement in light truck and SUV fuel economy over a 10 to  15 year period at costs that would be recoverable over the lifetime of ownership."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there's any doubt about the importance of this, just take a look at the example of the impact of fuel economy--or the current lack thereof--on Pottle Transportation, based in Bangor, ME.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Owner Barry Pottle stated this past year that their fuel economy has drifted from between 4 miles per gallon to 7 miles per gallon in the 25 years that he has led his company. I have a chart which indicates the gallons of consumption over a year for one vehicle and the corresponding cost as a result of current diesel prices. The aggregate cost over a year just for an increase of 2 miles per gallon is a staggering $20,000 for each truck. This bill will finally consider these heavy trucks in the  fuel economy framework for the very first time in history. As indicated from Pottle Transportation, it is perfectly clear that these fuel economy increases will result in substantial dividends for America's small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is that the current system does not provide fuel efficient vehicles on the market for large commercial and heavy duty trucks greater than 8,500 pounds. Just last week before the Senate Small Business Committee, Janet Myhre of Chuckals a company that distributes office products, stated that "fuel cost impact each and every transaction that our organization manages and is the third largest expense item on our financial statement."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Myhre was then asked if the company had considered switching to more efficient vehicles or alternative vehicles for their delivery trucks to minimize fuel costs. Ms. Myhre responded that Chuckals had investigated the market and found that there were "no commercial options" available for these vehicles. The market has not provided companies with the options of utilizing fuel efficient vehicles and for the sake of our Nation's small businesses, this Congress must begin to increase standards  for vehicles over 8,500 pounds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Still others have argued that this bill would place our domestic automobile manufacturers at an unacceptable disadvantage, but that is simply not the case it would be regrettable to view this debate in terms of fuel efficiency versus the future of our auto industry. When did energy independence and the strength of our domestic companies become mutually exclusive?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those who say our proposal is unrealistic and unreachable, the National Academy of Sciences reported 5 years ago that it is feasible to reach a 40 percent increase in fuel economy in 15 years--and that is with existing technology. Relatively simple improvements such as hybrid technologies, variable valve engines, high strength steel and aluminum, and continuously variable transmissions are all advancements the experts say could be implemented now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So do we really want to argue we don't have the technological wherewithal to make our vehicles travel more miles per gallon? Is it really the American Way to say, "We can't do that?" To the contrary, we should have already witnessed progress in these areas. If we had, perhaps our auto makers would be in better financial shape today. In fact, I certainly wish it were an American automaker who had recently announced surpassing the one million mark in sales of hybrids. In fact, in 2006, Toyota's  Prius was the company's third best-selling passenger car. So someone out there must want to buy more efficient vehicles. Talk about providing consumer choice, if anything consumers will have more choices for more cost-effective cars and SUVs and light trucks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, there are auto company business models that have demonstrated that consumers value fuel economy. In testimony before the House Energy and Commerce's Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality on March 14 of this year, Toyota's North American president, James Press, remarked, "2007 marks the 10th year of the Prius, our first hybrid. I am happy to say the introduction of Prius was a sound business decision."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, let me reiterate, we do not mandate any fuel economy increase for any specific model or any specific car company. Rather, we crafted the legislation so that the entirety of America's passenger fleet--cars, light trucks, and SUVs--must increase from an average of 25.2 miles per gallon now to an average of 35 miles per gallon by the year 2020. What we don't mandate is how exactly we get there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, each company is required to meet a corporate average fuel economy. Currently those standards are 22.2 miles per gallon for light trucks and 27.5 for passenger vehicles. However, the problem with  fuel economy standards does not reside in one company; it exists throughout the entire transportation sector. As a result, we initiated a fleet-wide solution rather than a piece-meal, company-by-company approach. In fact, the corporate average fuel economy standard actually ceases to exist under this bill; rather, it focuses results for the entire industry--a fleet wide average as opposed to a corporate average. This is a much broader and more flexible framework that will help domestic automakers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, some opponents have maintained that any legislation must not be "discriminatory against our companies," and that the "numbers should be set.....by experts who understand what can and cannot be done from a technology standpoint." Well, we couldn't agree more--and, once again, this is exactly what our initiative accomplishes by leaving the details to the experts at NHTSA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill ensures that NHTSA will establish a mathematical function that alters fuel economy requirements based on attributes, like weight. Because I agree that companies that focus on larger vehicles should not be unfairly punished, we have provided maximum latitude to preserve our domestic manufacturers, foster consumer choice, and improve fuel economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is, this measure navigates the narrow waters between doing less than we should, and more than we realistically can. In contrast, the amendment advanced by opponents of this legislation would only raise standards to an estimated fleetwide average of 30.6 by 2020. Furthermore, their proposal retains rigid categories for cars and light trucks and assigns different efficiency targets for each--36 miles per gallon by 2022 for cars, and 30 miles per gallon by 2025 for trucks. But if  you calculate for the entire U.S. fleet overall, accounting for the number of vehicles in each category estimated to be on the road at that time, you arrive at 30.6 miles per gallon by 2020 under this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, the proposal advanced by my colleague from Arkansas is a 5 mpg increase in 10 years, while our proposal is 10 miles per gallon in 10 years. And at the end of the day, the amendment would save, at best, merely 400,000 barrels of oil a day in 2020--accounting for just 3 percent of our daily import of oil--a mere drop in the bucket. So the ramifications between the proposals are significant, with ours saving 1.3 million barrels each day by 2020. Furthermore, in roughly 2023 this  bill will save 2.1 million barrels of oil each day--the equivalent to what we are currently importing from the Persian Gulf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President. This is clearly not a time for timidity. The current gas prices in Presque Isle, ME, right now is $3.13; in Arkansas, $2.99; in North Dakota, $3.14. These prices have and are continuing to raise transportation costs and the price of goods and services. Lower-income families and small businesses are financially strained beyond their capacity. It's been estimated that every time oil prices increase 10 percent, 150,000 Americans lose their job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the critical relevance to our environment is unambiguous, with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report this year dispelling any doubt about the reality of human induced climate change, and the reality that while the U.S. represents 4.6 percent of the world's population, we emit 23 percent of the planet's CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2. Our legislation would remove 358 million metric tons of global warming emissions in 2025 alone. This is nearly the same amount that India's entire economy current emits. As the Washington Post stated just yesterday in advocating for this bill, "There's a climate crisis brewing, and the transportation sector, which accounts for 33 percent of global warming pollution, must do its part to combat." </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, shouldn't we be leaving a better legacy than that?  Shouldn't we be striving to challenge and harness the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit that built America to the greatest extent possible, rather than settling for less? Just look at where our Nation has come with cell phones. This technological revolution has occurred, while our fuel economy standards have stagnated. We can do better. The underlying bill does do better while providing  an achievable solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud today's result and look forward to continuing to push for full adoption of this legislation into law.</paragraph>

  </speaking>

  <speaking speaker="400629" topic="CRISIS IN DARFUR">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak about the compromise amendment that has been offered by Senator Stevens. I appreciate the hard work and the long hours expended by the proponents of this amendment to craft an approach that bridges the significant differences on this issue. I commend all who were involved for their good work, their diligent work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is a good start, and I intend to support it. I also believe we can and should do more to improve the fuel efficiency of our cars and our trucks. With this bill, we have a great opportunity to finally end a 20-year stalemate and accomplish something that will benefit all of us--require our cars to go further on a tank of gas. This is the moment. The window is open, and I believe a bold approach is needed to achieve a major reduction in our Nation's dependence on foreign oil and  the emission of greenhouse gases. A bold approach is what made all of the difference almost three decades ago when Congress first established the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, program. At the time, auto executives protested, much as they protest today, saying</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, CAFE worked. It nearly doubled the average gas mileage of cars from 14 miles per gallon in 1976 to 27.5 miles per gallon in 1985. The increase in fuel economy saves us almost 3 million barrels of oil per day and prevents the emission of over 1 million tons of carbon dioxide per day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But our oil dependence has only gotten worse, and that is why we need a major improvement in fuel economy standards. Americans are now paying more than $3 a gallon for gas. We are importing 60 percent of our oil, much of it from the Middle East. Osama bin Laden has identified this dependence as a weakness, urging his supporters to "focus your operations on oil, especially in Iraq and the gulf area, since this will cause [the Americans] to die off."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The environmental effects of our oil dependence are also severe. The oil used in transportation accounts for a third of our Nation's emissions of greenhouse gases. Just in the last few months, we heard from a panel of top climate change experts from around the world that global warming is a certainty and that most of the temperature increase is likely due to rising greenhouse gas concentrations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All this, and yet the CAFE standards have not changed in 20 years. This deadlock deepens our dependence on foreign oil and impedes our efforts to address global climate change. Since 1985, efforts to raise the CAFE standards have been blocked by opponents who argued Congress does not possess the expertise to set specific benchmarks and that an inflexible congressional mandate would result in a sacrifice of safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am confident we could achieve higher fuel efficiency standards, and we could do this in a cost-effective manner without sacrificing safety. According to a recent report by the International Council on Clean Transportation, technologies exist today that can improve light-duty vehicle fuel economy by up to 50 percent over the next 10 years without any sacrifice in safety, through improvements in engines, transmissions, aerodynamics, and tires. Fuel savings would be more than enough to cover the  cost of these improvements when gas is at $3 per gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, I first joined with Senators Lugar, Biden, Smith, Bingaman, Harkin, Coleman, and Durbin to introduce the Fuel Economy Reform Act. This bill set a new course by establishing regular, continual, and incremental progress on fuel economy standards, targeting a 4-percent annual increase but preserving some flexibility for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to determine how to meet those targets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also believe we should look for ways to help automakers meet higher CAFE standards. The Health Care for Hybrids Act that I introduced is an example of how we can offer constructive assistance. This bill would establish a voluntary program in which automakers could choose to receive Federal financial assistance toward their retiree health care costs in return for investing the savings into developing fuel-efficient vehicles. This proposal could jump-start the industry's efforts to develop new  technology, improve the competitiveness of U.S. automakers in the growing market for hybrid vehicles, and help auto workers to get the health care they have been promised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's agreement makes long overdue progress on weaning America off our dependence on foreign oil and fighting climate change. It is an important step forward but bolder action will be necessary if we want to solve the dual problem facing our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will support this bill and this increase in fuel efficiency standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I commend all those who have worked so diligently to move this amendment forward. I do have to say, though, that I regret we have missed an opportunity to do more today. I will continue to work in the months to come to see if we can make some further progress on this front.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300022" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor on two very important issues, issues that really do go to the heart of the kind of economy and future that our Nation will have. One is the Employee Free Choice Act, which we will be voting on in the next day or two, and the other is the very important Energy bill that we have been debating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to the Employee Free Choice Act, for me, this is about preserving, supporting, and growing the American middle class. The middle class is the backbone of the American economy, and our unions are the backbone of the American middle class. It is time we passed into law the Employee Free Choice Act to give unions a level playing field so they can organize for fair wages, safe working conditions, and the hard-won rights and responsibilities that American workers demand and deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a moment of profound challenge for our country. There is a deep sense of concern that I have certainly heard and listened to as I have traveled throughout America. Americans know they cannot win in the global economy unless the middle class wins, but there is a feeling that some people are betting against the American middle class. Some people have assumed that in a global economy one of the changes that will have to be made is that the middle class will have to shrink; that inequity  is inevitable; that globalization is a harsh phenomenon that we have to accept. Well, I do not, and our families are right to be concerned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005 all income gains went to the top 10 percent of households. The vast majority of people--the other 90 percent--saw their incomes decline. Health care costs are up, gas prices are  up, the cost of college is up, and for 6 straight years worker productivity, which means how hard people work--because American workers are the hardest working people in the world--has gone up. But wages have either been stagnant or falling. 2005 was the first year since  the Great Depression that average personal savings were negative for a whole year. There is a sense that we are losing something in America; that basic bargain that allowed our country to succeed: if you work hard, you and your family can reach the middle class. You can have that American dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is not surprising that we are seeing the weakening of the American middle class at the same time we see unions under assault. In the early years of the National Labor Relations Act, the majority sign-up procedure was the presumptively valid way in which employees could choose a union. Over the years, however, culminating in the 1960s, a number of decisions shifted us to a new regime, a regime where employers can choose to require their employees to vote for unions through a one-sided election  process, dominated by employers, in order to secure collective bargaining rights. Some employers even began to make efforts to push unions out of the workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just consider these comparative facts: In the 1950s, companies illegally fired or punished during organizing campaigns, or they otherwise violated National Labor Relations Act rights, fewer than 1,000 employees. The number increased to 6,000 workers in 1969. And now, today, it is 31,000 workers who have been illegally fired or otherwise punished for wanting to exercise a fundamental right, one that we believe people should be able to exercise not only here in our country but around the world.  As the number of labor violations have increased, we have seen it become harder and harder for workers to organize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1956, unions represented 35 percent of the private workforce. The number today is only 7 percent. Our middle class, which unions helped to build in the 1930s, the 1940s, the 1950s, and the 1960s is suffering as a result. Studies show that the decline in union membership has been responsible for at least 20 percent of the rise in income inequality over the last three decades. I think it is probably much more than that, but that is what we can quantify.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time, therefore, that we modernize labor laws that are stacked against working people and stacked against their right to unionize. Right now, employers have unlimited access to employees in one-sided union representation elections. Employers are given every opportunity to dissuade workers in mandatory one-to-one meetings. They can delay votes for years. There are no fines or penalties or sanctions if an employer illegally fires or discriminates against a worker for collective bargaining.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At most, the worker is reinstated with backpay, an award that is, on average, so small that many employers regard it as a cost of doing business. Finally, 32 percent of workers who choose to unionize, still do not have a contract after a year of making that choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The system is broken. It is not only our collective bargaining and unionization system, it is our economy as it affects our middle class. Our country needs reforms that will bring balance to our labor laws, and our workers need the opportunity to unite with their coworkers to obtain the protections and benefits of America's labor movement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Union wages are 20 percent higher than nonunion wages. Union members are almost twice as likely to be covered by health insurance and to participate in employer-provided retirement plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unions improve safety conditions. For example, deaths in nonunion mines are almost twice as likely as deaths in mines where the workers are union members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unions certainly provide opportunities for women and minorities. Women in unions earn an extra $179 per week. African Americans in unions earn an extra $187 per week. Latinos in unions earn an extra $217 per week. Nonunion employees benefit from the efforts of the unions to seek benefits and protections. That is why it is so important we pass the Employee Free Choice Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is long past time to enact real financial penalties against those employers who illegally fire or retaliate against workers during an organizing campaign. It is long past time to allow employees to decide if they want to use majority sign-up to organize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, it is long past time to allow either employers or employees to request mediation if they are unable to negotiate a contract after 90 days of collective bargaining.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These changes will finally give employers an incentive to bargain in good faith and to avoid situations where years, and even decades, can pass without a bargaining agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe in the basic bargain. I believe that unions help keep that bargain for America's working people. I hope this Congress will uphold its end of that basic bargain; that this Congress will pass the Employee Free Choice Act; that the Senate will join the House, which has done so, to give employees the real, fair chance to garner the protections and benefits of unions and to give unions the opportunity to help bring workers into the middle class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is part of the equation; to respect and protect the rights of those in the workplace and to give them the opportunity to unionize. The other part of the equation is to have good jobs, good jobs with rising incomes. We need a source of new, good jobs in America. That is why this Energy bill is so important. Much of the debate about the Energy bill has been, rightly so, about the need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil--which I agree with 100 percent; the need to begin, finally, to address  seriously global warming--which I think is way overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there has not been enough talk about why this Energy bill is critical to the economy of the United States in the way it will help to create millions of new jobs. As the Presiding Officer knows, he and I offered an amendment, which we are pleased the managers accepted, to provide incentives for training and equipping and preparing the workforce to do what are called green-collar jobs. These are jobs that can't be outsourced, by and large. If we finally get serious--and I hope we will get back  to visit some of the financial incentives that need to be in this bill that unfortunately we were unable to include--we will begin to join other countries that have gotten smart about this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Germany gets a lot of its electricity now generated by solar--you know, panels on the roofs of residences and offices. The last time I checked, Germany was not a tropical climate, but they have taken advantage of government-incentives to move the market toward using solar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Denmark is also moving toward more wind energy. The United Kingdom, which went into Kyoto when our country left it, has created tens of thousands of new jobs weatherizing homes, installing new energy technology such as solar, such as wind. We could do this many times over. We believe we could create millions of new, good-paying jobs for hard-working Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every so often we have to regenerate our job creation in America. During the 1990s, we had a lot of new jobs that were related to telecom and information technology. We saw the creation of 22 million new jobs between 1993 and 2001. We saw more people lifted out of poverty than at any time in our country's history. We saw shared prosperity--not what we are seeing today, where the bulk of the benefits go to a very small sliver of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Energy bill is about jobs, it is about creating new, good-paying jobs for hard-working Americans. What I am looking at when I think of the Employee Free Choice Act and when I think of this Energy bill is how we get back into balance, how we get back to where the economy works for everybody, where the market is not stacked against those who are not already privileged, where unions can once again be a vehicle for people moving into and staying in the middle class and, comparably, where we  can have a new source of jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also have to recognize how we have to look at the jobs that are already in the economy and how the Energy bill will affect them. I am hopeful we will think seriously about lifting the health care costs off a lot of our labor-intensive, energy-intensive, capital-intensive industries in America, such as the automobile industry, because laboring under the costs of  health care is an uncompetitive position for them in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a lot to be done. I wish to be sure that as we look at the economy and begin to try to get it back into that balance that works best for America, that we vote for the Employee Free Choice Act, which is a way of giving employees the choice to have a better life for themselves and their families. There is a lot to be done in our country. I am very optimistic we can begin tackling our challenges. But so much of what we have to do to create the framework for our people to have that better  future has to come from this Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's look at the future together. Let's make decisions that will give the tools to our people to show they are the best workers and the most competitive and productive people in the world, to unleash that dynamism in the American economy, and to demonstrate clearly that we stand with the American middle class.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from North Dakota.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in this body we are on the brink of something that is momentous, and that is significant energy legislation to reduce our dependence on foreign fuels. The bill before us will break new ground. We will have fuel efficiency standards increased for the first time since 1975. This is the result of compromise, of principled compromise that advances the cause of reducing our dependence on foreign fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year I introduced the BOLD act, Breaking Our Long-term Dependence. That was perhaps the most comprehensive energy legislation introduced in this body all last year. It had many provisions, many provisions to encourage further development of ethanol and biodiesel and wind energy and solar energy--all the renewables. But more than that, it had provisions to expand domestic production of oil and gas in a responsible way; also providing clean coal incentives because, after all, over 50 percent  of our electricity in this country comes from coal. That is not going to fundamentally change anytime soon. So we have to take measures to increase the environmentally friendly aspects of coal usage and to improve our ability to produce and use that resource in a clean way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I am delighted we are on the brink of passing something significant and the beginning of something that could be much bigger, I am very disappointed the provisions that passed the Senate Finance Committee on an overwhelming bipartisan vote did not get the 60 votes required to advance. Those provisions would have also taken us in a new direction, and they contained many of the provisions contained in the BOLD Act that I introduced last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those provisions shifted our incentives away from fossil fuels because, with the high price of fossil fuels, incentives aren't required there. Instead, we took money that had previously gone to fossil fuels and shifted the funds to renewables and conservation--again, in a vote that passed on a bipartisan basis, a very strong vote out of the Senate Finance Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say there are some who have argued it costs too much money to have those incentives for renewables and for conservation. It is true, that bill costs $28.6 billion over the next 10 years--$28.6 billion over the next 10 years. But we are going to spend, over that same period, $3,000 billion on imported oil. In fact, that is probably a low-side estimate because last year alone we spent over $270 billion importing foreign oil, much of it from the least stable parts of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, $28 billion is a lot of money over 10 years. But $3,000 billion on imported oil dwarfs it. It is over 100 times as much. Isn't it a good investment to spend 1 percent of what we are going to spend importing foreign oil to develop our own resources in this country? How much better would it be for a President of the United States, instead of depending on the Middle East, to be able to look to the Midwest of this country to help grow our way out of this crisis by using ethanol and biodiesel?  Instead of sending $270 billion to places that are unfavorable to us, to spend $270 billion right here in America--how different would our country look if that money, instead of going abroad, was staying at home?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one should think we are not going to have another possibility on the legislation that came out of the Finance Committee. There will be another opportunity. We will have a chance in the House of Representatives, in the conference committee, to add back those provisions that passed on a strong majority vote, not only in the Finance Committee but on the floor of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We didn't have a supermajority, we didn't have the 60 votes. We had 57. Of course the leader changed his vote to be on the prevailing side so he could move to reconsider. We are missing another Senator because of a family obligation and, of course, we are missing our colleague, Senator Johnson, because of his illness. But Senator Johnson will be back, and the Senator who was missing because of a family obligation will be back. And Senator Reid will switch his vote.  Then we will have the 60 votes necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one should be under any illusion that we are not going to take this opportunity to strengthen our country and to reduce our dependence on foreign oil because we will have that additional opportunity and the votes will be here and we will have a comprehensive energy package to take to the Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wonder, while the Senator is still standing, if I could ask him a question. I was standing someplace where I caught an echo on your last 2 or 3 minutes. Could you maybe repeat it, because it hit my ear wrong. I did not quite get it. What did you talk about when it went to the House and came back and what?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>No. It is unfortunate the Senator did not hear my remarks. I made it very clear in the remarks what I think will happen. We were missing one Senator because of a family obligation, missing another Senator because of illness. Senator Reid, of course, changed his vote to be on the prevailing side. That will provide the 60 votes required.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>I think with the passage of time, I say to my colleague and friend, we will have more votes as people think about the consequences of the failure to get a stronger package; that there is time now to work out an agreement to add votes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>I see. Well, it would be good if you would add to that there might be a little opportunity to work together on that, too, you know. If you get a few people a little anxious, you might find you could not get cloture again. That could happen.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>It could. I prefer to be an optimist. I prefer to think of the extraordinary vote we had out of the Finance Committee, a bipartisan vote, very strong, and the fact that we have more than a majority here with votes missing. Those votes are going to come back.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>Yes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>I hope. I believe before this year is out, we will have a chance to have a more comprehensive package than the one we will be able to move on this floor in the next several days. I believe it will be a package that will enjoy strong bipartisan support, just as the package did that came out of the Finance Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>Well, you are inviting some of us not to approve anything tonight, to have another cloture, and you have nothing going to conference.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>Well, that would be a tragedy for the Nation, and those who  would engage in that tactic, I think, would pay the consequences.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>Senator, you know, you and I have been here long enough that we go through these tragedies every now and then. But they get worked out. Then as long as you do not try to defy reality--there were a lot of people who didn't want this to happen; a lot of people did. That is the Senate. Now we will see.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>That is the great thing about our country. Some people do not want to advance on the question of reducing our dependence; some want to stay stuck where we have been; others want to move forward. I believe those who want to move forward are ultimately going to prevail.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>So do I.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>That is a good thing for this country. I welcome this debate, because I think the American people think it is long overdue that we make this advance, and it is to the credit of this body that we are prepared to move forward tonight.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>Well, there is no doubt in my mind we are going to move ahead. We have had some terrific movement ahead in the past 3 1/2 , 4 years. Some of us who are questioning how you think it is going to happen have been part of that over the last couple of years. We are not--nobody is going to sit here and say: There is one way, only one group of Senators knows how to do this. We did our share in this pretty good bill you voted for a couple of years ago. Had we implemented the provisions  of that with financing that went with it, we would already be a long way toward the development of both supply and conservation; supply of the type you want, and supply of the type some others want. We would already have that going. Instead, we do not, because we haven't financed it. We should have. You were with us on the financing. It should have happened.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>I say to my colleague and my friend, I was proud to support that bill. I was proud of the leadership shown by the Senator from New Mexico on that legislation. I  am proud of the leadership shown by the Senators from New Mexico on this bill. I just think, at the end of the day, we are going to have even stronger legislation before we complete our work this year. That was the point I was making in my earlier remarks. Look, we all know the genius of this body is that there are those who agree and those who disagree; those who favor, those who oppose. Tonight we can celebrate together. We are making progress. That is important for the country, but more needs  to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think any Senator would leave here tonight saying this legislation alone is all we can do. We can do more this year, and we should.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Wyoming.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300029" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I oftentimes laugh. It is either Iowa, or Ohio, or Idaho. The other side of that equation with the late Craig Thomas, I am Larry Craig, Craig Thomas. His wife is Susan, my wife is Suzanne. It was not at all unusual that sometimes we would get mixed up. People would come to my office looking for Craig Thomas, and would find out they needed to be on the other side of a mountain range and out across a rather wide expanse of land toward Casper, Wyoming, instead of Boise,  Idaho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I understand. Thank you very much, Mr. President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be brief. We are very close, I believe, toward the final passage of an energy bill that many of us have spent a good deal of time with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank a few folks who have spent a lot more time with this issue than I or than the principals on it. Cory McDaniel on my staff, legislative LA for energy, who has spent a great deal of time over the last good many months as we have fashioned the SAFE Act, as we have fashioned a clean portfolio standard versus a renewable portfolio standard, I thank Cory for that effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank Frank Macciarola, the minority staff director, and Bob Simon, the majority staff director. We worked closely with them as we have worked our way through this issue. Sam Fowler, counsel for the majority, and Judy Pensabene, minority counsel, have all been very helpful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have worked closely with Senator Dorgan and his staff. Franz Wuerfmannsdobler and Nate Hill on his staff have been very helpful; also Colin Jones, a fellow from the National Lab in Idaho on my staff, and Darren Parker, a research assistant, have been extremely helpful. A couple of interns, J.C. Dunkelberger and Brian Riga, have been very helpful throughout all of this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think those of us who have been in the Senate a long time know this work gets done certainly by us in some instances but by our staff in most instances. They spend a lot of time, they develop a level of expertise in working with us on some of these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank these men and woman for their assistance in a complicated process. I hope we can finish and produce a work product that will come back to us in a reasonable form that many of us can support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am frustrated we are potentially moving a bill out of the Senate that does not have any production. It is all about the future and the outyears. I do not think America worries about the outyears when they go to a pump and pay $3 and 10 or 15 or 20 cents a gallon. They worry about tomorrow and next year and the next year. That is what I think all of us have voiced in this debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Somehow it is not right anymore to drill holes in the ground and pull out oil and refine it. I do believe that still fits into the equation and will for several decades to come, as we move to flex fuel, as we move to hybrids, as we move to hydrogen, as we move to electricity, as we are, and as we will continue to, and we must.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in the meantime, it is a reality that this Nation has to continue to produce. As loudly as I and some on the other side have spoken about it, the Senate collectively does not want to seem to go there anymore. My guess is the American consumer, tragically enough, is going to pay the price. I hope that ultimately we do get some more production built into this legislation or other public policy as we move down the road because it is the reality of where we are. While we work our way away from  it and take this great economy and start shifting it and moving it around to new economies in the field of energy, it takes a great deal of investment that the private sector will make, and it takes the kinds of incentives, and it takes a substantial amount of time that I do not think is as reflected in this policy as I would hope, and as I have hoped it would be.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Colorado.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak tonight as we get close to the point hopefully of passing an energy bill here in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first acknowledge the leadership of both Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici. When we look at where we are today on energy, much of it started, the bipartisan cooperation, between Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici, in the passage of the 2005 Energy Policy Act. I know there have been critics of that act, but it was a creation that was put out in a bipartisan fashion, a significant step forward on energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation that came out of the Energy Committee, which is included in the bill which we are about to vote on, in large part is a very good step forward in terms of trying to address the goals we had in that particular legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also congratulate both Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye. I think when you think about the people who have made such a mark, an imprint on the Senate today and on our country, two of our national heroes are Ted Stevens and Dan Inouye. I never get tired of hearing the story of Senator Inouye and his service to our country. Every time I see him and I remember his great contribution and sacrifice to our country, I remember those are the greatest of  the greatest generation, and certainly both Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye embody that greatness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee for their great work. As a member of the Finance Committee, we worked very hard to come up with legislation that would help us move forward in dealing with the reality of getting energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I am disappointed that part of the package is not included as we move  forward toward final passage here, it nonetheless represented the best of our thinking about how we could invest in this new imperative of America, and gets us to a new energy future for the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank the rest of my colleagues who were involved in some of the discussions that have been underway today. Let my say that from my point of view, there is no more important issue we must deal with here in Washington, here in the Congress, than the issue of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we look at the big issues of our time in the 21st century, I think in my mind there are three issues we have to deal with. We have to deal with the issue of foreign relations and how we put the world back together again and restore America's greatness in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also need to make sure we embark on a new clean energy future for the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also need to deal with other issues that are very difficult, the enormous challenge that we face with the health care in America today. That issue is bankrupting America's families and America's businesses day by day. So how we move forward with those three issues is very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But tonight we are at the doorstep of taking a significant step forward on one of those huge issues; that is, the issue of energy and moving forward to establishing a clean energy future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, when I often talk about energy, I think back to what happened in the early 1970s and through the 1970s with both President Nixon and President Jimmy Carter, where President Nixon declared the need for us to be energy independent, and coined that term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then following him, President Carter spoke about energy independence as being something that was the moral equivalent of war. Well, the fact is that in those days the driver for those statements and the coining of that term came from the economic volatility that was caused by the formation of OPEC and their ability to be able to influence the world markets on oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think today we have three inescapable forces that drive us to look at the clean energy future as the imperative of the 21st century. Those inescapable forces are, first and foremost, our national security. When we see what is happening in the Middle East with Hezbollah and in Lebanon with Hamas in the Gaza, you know that terrorist organizations such as those are being funded by the very oil that is being consumed by the free world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So for us to become energy independent is our way of making sure we are not held hostage to those kinds of organizations, to the oil barons and sheiks of this world. It is an imperative we do that from a national security point of view.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, I think it is now beyond argument in our world today that the issue of global warming is here, and we will have some debate that will come on down the road with respect to how we address the issue of global warming here in America and across the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is inescapable that we must do something about global warming if we are to save civilization for our children and grandchildren and save this planet we have been given the humble privilege of inhabiting. That is an inescapable force that will drive us to a clean energy future in the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last is the economic opportunity and dealing with the economic volatility that happens when you are hostage to someone who controls supplies such as OPEC can today. The economic opportunity is one that you already see happening throughout our great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my State of Colorado, where 2 years ago, before passage of the 2005 act, there was really nothing going on in terms of renewable energy, we have totally turned that around. We have now ethanol plants in places such as Fort Morgan and Yuma. We have a number of other ethanol plants springing up in Windsor and Devon, down in the southern part of the State, places which were part of the forgotten rural America which had been hanging on by a shoestring just to keep their communities alive. There  is a new breath of activity, a new breath of hope and opportunity and optimism in rural America, in large part because we believe we can grow our way to energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe strongly we are headed in the right track with the legislation that has been put forward. I am hopeful that we will move forward and conclude our effort on this energy legislation tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to go back for a minute and reflect upon the legislation that came out of the Energy Committee which was led in a remarkable fashion by Senator Bingaman, with the support of Senator Domenici. It was a bipartisan effort that focused on three major issues, all of which are included in the underlying legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first of those was moving forward with alternative fuels. If you think about what we have done with the renewable fuels standard, we will be quintupling the amount of energy we create from biofuels. We will be opening a new chapter with cellulosic ethanol that will make the biofuels targets a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, the efficiency measures are important to make sure we stop wasting the energy we consume. When we look at what the experts tell us, from the Department of Energy, the National Renewable Energy Lab, we know we waste 60 percent of the energy that is consumed in America today. Therefore, the lowest hanging fruit for all of us is to move forward with efficiency measures. We are doing that in the part of the legislation that was created in the Energy Committee. We also are doing it very  much with the CAFE standards, the fuel efficiency standards that were negotiated today with the leadership of Senators Stevens and Inouye, Senator Feinstein, and many others who were involved. That will help us achieve the oil savings targets and goals we have set forth in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, we take some movement forward in terms of dealing with the issue of carbon by making sure that we are dealing with carbon sequestration mapping in the United States and that we develop the way forward in terms of how we sequester carbon. There has been debate about coal. Not everybody agrees on how we ought to move forward with respect to coal. I believe it is important that we look at coal as a possible resource because it currently generates about 50 percent of our electricity today  and it is the most abundant resource we have in this country. We have enough coal resources for the next 200 years of energy for America's use. Coal is to the United States what oil is to Saudi Arabia. So it is important that we not turn a blind eye and say we are a nation that is not going to look at all at coal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the new technologies we have with respect to IGCC--the creation of electricity in a way that can help us with the hybrid plug-ins--will open a whole new chapter today and build on the 2005 act. That will all be very important. Carbon sequestration needs to be a part of the equation. We know there are formations throughout this country where, in fact, we can sequester carbon. The technology is not all that complex. The enhanced oil recovery efforts and the technology we have with EOR is  technology that has been used in the oilfields for decades. We know there are formations out there where we can, in fact, store carbon. So we can find ways of utilizing this abundant fuel we have in the United States to help us fuel the energy needs of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the many Members who have worked on making this a possibility--and I hope we do get the 60 votes we need--there have been a lot of people on many staffs on both the majority side and the minority side who have worked to make this happen. I thank each and every one of them for getting us to the point we are today. I know the countless hours and nights and days they have spent working on this issue. Without them, we would not be where we are tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the people in my office who have been working hard on this legislation for a long time, both in the Energy Committee and in the Finance Committee. I say thank you to Steve Black, who has been an enormous player on the energy issue, in 2005 as well as today; Matt Lee-Ashley, Suzanne Wells in my office, Grant Leslie, and Sam Mitchell, who have done an enormous job pulling all of this together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a major step we are about ready to take. I look forward to being a part of the celebration when we get this all done, hopefully in the not too distant future before we go into the wee hours of tomorrow morning.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300068" topic="EFFICIENCY TITLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of the Energy Committee, its chairman and ranking member, in crafting this bill. However, I have concerns about some aspects of the efficiency title specifically as they relate to regional standards for heating and cooling products and the possibility of more than one energy standard such as SEER or EER being applied to these products. I sincerely hope that we can work on resolving these issues following the passage of this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="EFFICIENCY TITLE">
    <paragraph>I am happy to work with my colleague from Arkansas to improve this bill, and will work with her on this issue following the passage of this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300068" topic="EFFICIENCY TITLE">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the chairman's good-faith commitment to work with us on this issue. I raised these concerns when this bill was being discussed in the Energy Committee, and I continue to have reservations about how the language, as written, can be implemented.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="RPS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would ask the majority leader, through the President, if he is in agreement with me on a matter of some importance. I offered an amendment last week to require that 15 percent of the electricity sold in the Nation come from renewable energy resources by the year 2020. We have not been able to get an agreement to have a vote on this amendment, or on other forms of it that might have provided more flexibility to States in meeting the goals of the amendment. We would  have been agreeable to accepting a supermajority threshold for passage of the amendment. We still could not reach agreement. That implies, to me, that opponents of the measure believe that 60 or more Senators support the amendment. I believe that they may be correct in assuming so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would have been as significant an amendment as we could have added to the bill. Such a standard would increase the generation of renewables in the Nation from something over 2 percent to a much greater share of our generation supply. We have tried again and again to provide, in law, mechanisms to allow renewable energy technologies to take the place in the market that they deserve. The Senate has passed similar amendments three times. This provision would result in cleaner electricity  generation, be the source of extensive creation of new jobs, enhance our energy security, lower the price of natural gas, and could even result in lower electricity prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the importance of this provision of the Nation, and the clear, strong support for it in the Senate, I would ask if it is the intention of the majority leader, should we conclude business on the Energy Bill without passing it, to seek another vehicle for the passage of the renewable electricity standard?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="RPS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would answer the chairman of the Energy Committee, who has done great work in managing this complicated energy bill, that I agree with him as to the importance of this amendment to the Nation, and on the broad support that it enjoys in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is little that we could do in the electricity sector that would bring more benefits--in terms of consumer savings, reducing natural gas demand, and slowing the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. We have sought in this bill to broaden the range of energy resources that we depend on for motor fuels to include renewable resources. We must do the same for our electricity supply. I share his strong belief that enactment of a national renewable electricity standard is critical for the Nation's  efforts to become more energy independent and to reduce the risks of global warming, as well as create new jobs in the clean energy industry. I promise to work with him to see that proposal gets fair consideration, a vote and, if at all possible, enacted into law this Congress.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, right now, people are at gas stations across America, filling up cars and trucks to get to work, take their kids to school, and run their errands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In May of 2002, a gallon of gas cost $1.40. Today that same gallon of gas costs $3.22. In just 5 years, the price of gas has more than doubled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gas isn't the only energy cost that has spiked in the last 5 years. In New Jersey, individuals, families, and businesses are paying 25 percent more for electricity than they were just 5 years ago. These high prices are hurting our families--families whose budgets are already stretched thin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also know that our energy policies are hurting our environment. The emissions from our cars and trucks, electric utilities, and factories are causing global warming--a fact recently verified by a United Nations Panel on Climate Change. The energy bill before us marks the first serious attempt in years to address our energy crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it takes a measured but appropriate approach to improving CAFE standards governing the fuel efficiency of our cars and trucks. Right now, Japan leads the world in fuel efficiency. Many of their cars and trucks get more than 40 miles per gallon. The United States is far behind. Our passenger cars have been stuck at CAFE standards of 27.5 miles per gallon since 1990--and our light trucks get just 21.6 miles per gallon. We must do better, and with this bill, we will.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our energy bill calls for increasing fuel efficiency to 35 miles per gallon by the year 2020. As we improve our fuel efficiency, we decrease both the amount of gas Americans have to pay for and the greenhouse gases our cars emit. But despite what many think, greenhouse gases don't only come from cars and trucks. Buildings have a significant impact on the environment and on the health of every American--accounting for nearly 40 percent of America's greenhouse gases. The Federal Government is the  largest owner and renter of buildings in the Nation and is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, poorly designed schools can cause the air inside to be unhealthy. This poor air quality increases childhood asthma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 67 percent of schools have a design problem that contributes to asthma. For those reasons, I introduced the High Performance Green Buildings Act, which is now included in the Energy bill. This legislation focuses on making our Federal buildings "green" and improving the environmental and health impacts of our schools. I worked with our former colleague, Senator Jeffords, on this bill in the past--and the language now in the Energy bill represents a collaborative effort between myself,  Senator Boxer, and Senators Snowe and Warner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In comparison to standard buildings, the average green building has better air quality, uses 30 percent less energy, and results in nearly 40 percent fewer emissions. Green buildings also have smaller electric bills, which saves owners and tenants on their bottom lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government must lead by example and achieve those results for its buildings. Accordingly, my green buildings bill will direct the General Services Administration to use a green building certification that all Federal buildings should achieve. It also provides grants and voluntary guidelines for schools to lessen their environmental impacts--and improve the health of the students, teachers, and staff inside them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill calls for demonstration projects to show the public that green buildings are environmentally sound, benefit people's health, and are both cost-effective and practical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The States are doing their part. New Jersey and 21 other States have already signed bills similar to my legislation. Many private companies are doing their part as well. For example, Bank of America is building a new highrise office tower in Manhattan--a building that will be entirely green. It is time for the Federal Government to do its part.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need a solution to our energy problems: one that protects the American pocketbook, improves our CAFE standards, reduces our dependence on foreign oil, and promotes green building. This energy bill will be an important step forward toward achieving these goals.st</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. 1792, filed by Senators STEVENS, SNOWE, ALEXANDER, and CARPER, and cosponsored by Senators FEINSTEIN and KERRY, among others. This bipartisan compromise reflects the input of Members, industry,  and consumers, and is good policy for our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I particularly wish to congratulate Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN for her dedicated efforts over the years to update our Nation's fuel economy standards. The success of the amendment today is a tribute to her tenacious and skilled advocacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At every step of the legislative process following the introduction of <bill type="s" number="357">S. 357</bill>, the Ten in Ten Fuel Economy Act, by Senators FEINSTEIN and OLYMPIA SNOWE, the authors and cosponsors of <bill type="s" number="357">S. 357</bill> and members of the Senate Commerce Committee have worked together in a bipartisan manner to address the concerns of the automotive industry. In particular, this group worked hard to ensure that automakers will not face a significant burden when meeting the first improvements to fuel economy standards  in more than 30 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that Members from both sides of the aisle continued to work together to produce the amendment adopted today. While addressing a number of the concerns raised by automakers regarding the Feinstein-Snowe Ten in Ten Fuel Economy Act as reported by the Commerce Committee, the amendment preserves the core goals and fuel savings of Ten in Ten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment directs the Secretary of Transportation to increase fuel economy for automobiles to 35 miles per gallon by 2020, as in Ten in Ten. But in the years that follow from 2021 to 2030, the Secretary shall increase fuel economy at a maximum feasible rate instead of at a pace of 4 percent per annum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we have a breakthrough in battery technology, then 4 percent per year may well be too low. If there are unforeseen problems, 4 percent may be too high. The amendment will allow the Secretary to set an appropriate standard in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kerry-Cantwell second degree amendment to the Stevens-Carper-Feinstein-Snowe-Kerry amendment also directs the Secretary to establish and implement an action plan to ensure that 50 percent of the vehicles for sale in 2015 are alternative fuel automobiles. We must encourage manufacturers to improve their fleets' fuel economy by exploring new technologies and producing alternative fuel vehicles. I commend Senators KERRY and CANTWELL for developing this compromise amendment that  addresses this important goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By adopting the bipartisan compromise amendment and <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> as amended, we will place the country on a path toward reducing our Nation's dependence on foreign oil, protecting the environment, and helping consumers deal with rising gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I wish to express my appreciation for the excellent efforts of the dedicated staff on the Senate Commerce Committee including David Strickland, Alex Hoehn-Saric, Ken Nahigian, Mia Petrini, and Jason Bomberg.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the pending energy bill and the future of energy in the U.S. I commend Chairman BINGAMAN for crafting this compromise bill and bringing it before the full Senate for consideration. Like many of us, he recognizes that the energy crisis we face will be long-term and life-altering, and that we must enlist all Americans, and the cooperation of governments worldwide, to solve it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's be honest. We have only gotten to this critical point because we have put off for too long momentous energy decisions. In fact, the main answer to our energy dilemma from the party across the aisle while they were in power in Congress was the 2005 energy bill, a scandalous mix of billions in drilling subsidies and other giveaways to big oil companies which even some of them admitted were unnecessary. That effort was doomed from the start: While we consume 25 percent of the world's oil,  we only hold 3 percent of its reserves--so we can't, we never could, drill our way out of the problem. The results of that bill in the last 2 years haven't been surprising: skyrocketing oil and gas prices; no slackening of demand; increased U.S. dependence on foreign oil; underfunding of renewable energy initiatives; and slashed conservation</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have known for a long time about the three-fold threat--to our national security, our economic vitality, and our environmental health--posed by our over-reliance on foreign oil. To our national security, because we now import about 60 percent of our oil from some of the most politically unstable regions of the world, governed by authoritarian regimes, some serving as breeding grounds for terror. To our economic vitality, through high gasoline prices, rising home heating costs, and electricity  price spikes which strain family budgets, burden businesses, and make our Nation less competitive. To our environmental health, due to smog, climate change, increased asthma risks, cancer and other diseases caused or exacerbated by pollution. We continue on this path to our peril. A better way forward is to embark now on a course of dramatic change in our energy policies, including setting clear long-term goals and enforceable benchmarks; backing our rhetoric on conservation, renewable energy</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our over-reliance on foreign oil, especially from the Middle East, makes us vulnerable to price spikes, supply disruptions, and market uncertainty. We also, sadly, pay for the privilege of propping up authoritarian regimes that use oil reserves to bolster their own power, insulate themselves from demands for political and economic liberalization, and protect themselves from the need to improve their human rights records--what NYT columnist Tom Friedman calls "petro-authoritarianism." This is  why the government of Iran can suppress its own people; it's why Russia can crush Chechnya and intimidate its neighbors; it's why China, a major owner of Sudan's main oil consortium, can continue to block effective U.N. action on Darfur. We are effectively financing them to do it through our oil purchases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we have been doing this for decades. I was first elected to Congress in 1974, in the wake of an energy crisis prompted by an OPEC oil embargo. It was a summer of gas lines and shortages, of steps large and small taken to address the problem. And now here we are, fighting another uphill battle to enact a good energy bill, which contains an important set of incremental steps to address these problems. I would like us to go much farther than this bill does. But at least with its passage we would  finally be headed in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think almost everyone in this Chamber would agree that the future of energy in this country, to the maximum extent possible, should be clean, green, domestic, and renewable. We know that our dependence on foreign oil leaves us vulnerable, increases our trade deficit, and creates volatility in energy prices and hardships for American consumers and businesses. We know that emissions from fossil-fuel fired powerplants cause unnecessary illnesses and deaths. And we know that our emissions of greenhouse  gases are causing global climate change, which is leading to higher sea levels, melting glaciers, shifting ecosystems, and ocean acidification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our national energy policy must be retooled to address those threats directly, and to encourage the development and deployment of technologies that will encourage the use of clean, domestic, renewable energy. This bill, modest as it is, does that, I applaud Senators STEVENS, INOUYE, FEINSTEIN, and others for crafting a compromise on fuel economy standards, though we must recognize that it is a compromise: the new fuel economy standards contained in this bill do not do enough to achieve  the full potential of current technologies to increase fuel efficiency. Even so, setting the CAFE target at 35 miles per gallon by 2020, is  an important advance for a Congress that has not managed to increase standards at all for over 20 years. There was no increase in fuel economy standards to blame for the decline in American auto manufacturers' market share from 73 percent in 1986 to 55 percent in 2006; the future strength</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have spent much of this debate on a few contentious issues, but there are many significant provisions in the bill that have not been as widely discussed, including creating research and demonstration programs for carbon capture and sequestration, substantially increasing appliance efficiency standards, and making the Federal Government a leader in the use of renewable energy and green construction. Moreover, this legislation puts the Senate on record in our support of engagement with other  countries, especially those in the Western Hemisphere, to better coordinate energy security and assure diverse and reliable energy supplies. While it is not perfect, it is a step in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say a final word about the elephant in the room, which we have scarcely acknowledged thus far in this debate about energy policy: climate change. Climate and energy policy are inextricable--any energy policy we adopt will have an enormous impact on the climate. I recognize that this body is not yet ready to adopt a comprehensive measure to substantially limit emissions of greenhouse gases, or to take the bold step of imposing some form of a comprehensive corporate carbon  tax. If we were honest with the American people, that is the kind of bold step we would take to help resolve our energy dilemma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth is that, on energy and climate issues, Americans are ahead of their political leaders. They understand the serious, long-term cumulative threat climate change poses to their children and grandchildren; they're willing to make tough choices to address it. They understand that cleaner energy is possible; they know that fuel-efficient vehicles and appliances are within reach--but they're worried that American manufacturers are falling behind. Americans overwhelmingly support the development  of alternative energy, higher mileage standards, hybrid vehicles, and incentives to produce and install more energy efficient appliances. They see the potential for savings generated by energy-efficient technologies, both for their families and for a more efficient, more effective use of their tax dollars by government. And they want change. They understand that the threats of climate change are not geographically remote</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I regret that I cannot support the Energy bill that we are voting on tonight. I will vote against cloture on the bill and against final passage. There are many good provisions of this bill--particularly in the areas of energy efficiency and renewable fuels--but at its core, the bill contains CAFE provisions that will needlessly harm the American auto industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we had a real opportunity to make significant strides in improving fuel economy and reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and doing it in a sensible way that would support American manufacturing and American workers. Instead, the bill before the Senate tonight has chosen the path that is most likely to harm our workers by combining trucks with cars for new standards that are overly aggressive and unachievable and may have a particularly harmful effect on those manufacturers who produce  a high percentage of light trucks and produce small cars in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America has lost 3 million manufacturing jobs since 2001, over 200,000 jobs in the automotive sector. Our companies face enormous competition in the global marketplace without support from the U.S. Government. Our companies are not competing against companies overseas they are competing against other governments that strongly support their manufacturing sectors with currency manipulation and trade barriers against our products. American companies must compete against those who are protected from  import competition by their government, have cheap labor costs, do not pay health insurance and legacy costs, or do not have to meet our strict environmental standards. Our manufacturers can compete with anyone on a level playing field but right now that field is tilted against them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tonight, we are choosing to follow a path that will continue that uneven playing field for our manufacturers through our own regulatory process--no other countries would do that to its companies. The proponents of these provisions--a combined car-truck standard of 35 miles per gallon by 2020 claim that these standards will be easy to meet with new advanced technology and suggest that these fuel economy numbers are supported by the National Academy of Sciences. But that is simply not true. In  fact, the National Academy of Sciences, in its 2002 report that is frequently cited, specifically stated that the conclusions it drew about technologies should not be interpreted as fuel economy recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was a better way. An amendment sponsored by Senator Pryor that I cosponsored, along with Senators BOND, VOINOVICH, STABENOW and MCCASKILL, offered that alternative approach. Our amendment would have taken bold steps forward to improve fuel economy, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and protect the environment. We did that in our amendment by establishing aggressive, yet achievable, new and different fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks and by setting  clear interim milestones for reaching these new standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment would have required a thirty-percent increase in fuel economy standards for cars by 2022 and a thirty-five-percent increase in standards for trucks by 2025, and our amendment would have provided certainty that these standards will be met. It also would have provided the predictability needed by our auto companies to plan ahead and utilize new advanced technology to the maximum extent possible. Our amendment would have provided the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,  NHTSA--the agency that would set these standards--tools necessary to establish the standards in a sensible way that would have ensured the standards would be at the maximum feasible level, even if that level proved to be higher than the number included in this amendment. To ensure that the technology would be available to meet these standards, our amendment also would have provided a significant new infusion of Federal dollars to support advanced technology research, development,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To be sure, meeting the new fuel economy standards under our amendment would have been a stretch and a challenge for all of our country's auto manufacturers--both our traditional American manufacturers, who built the foundation of the auto industry in this country, as well as manufacturers such as Toyota, Mazda, and Mitsubishi. But it would not have pushed our companies to the breaking point, as I fear the provisions of this legislation will do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I cannot support this bill tonight, and I regret that we did not take a different path. I was encouraged that the Commerce Committee leaders were  willing to take some of our suggestions and make some improvements in their bill. Through our negotiations, we received a few significant concessions. Specifically, the standards in the final bill are for the industry as a whole and not standards to be met company by company, ending a procedure which has  discriminated against the domestic industry. The bill also makes clear that NHTSA is required to set standards according to an attribute based system that will look at the different attributes of cars and trucks, and make clear that the fuel economy standards after 2020 will be set at the maximum feasible level rather than requiring an arbitrary and unrealistic increase of four percent annually and was true with the Commerce Committee bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that we can reduce our dependence on oil, reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, and improve the overall fuel economy of our vehicles on the road while supporting our American manufacturers in the global market place. To do that, we need a major public-private partnership and major investments in leap-ahead energy technologies, including advanced technology vehicles. We need a huge infusion of resources and a commitment from both the private sector and the Federal government to support  efforts to reach these important goals. At a minimum, we cannot have our government act in ways that will unfairly disadvantage our American manufacturers against their global competitors.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the improvements to vehicle efficiency that are included in <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>. It is time for us to make reasonable, achievable, and meaningful increases to the corporate average fuel economy standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past 2 weeks I have spoken repeatedly about the national security, economic security, and environmental security implications of the energy debate that we are holding. The converging and growing risks of our overdependence on foreign oil are well understood among Americans, who see the impacts of our failed energy policy on a daily basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the gas station, consumers see prices spike at OPEC's whim or with the threat of supply disruptions in countries like Venezuela or Nigeria. In their businesses, Americans feel the pain of soaring oil prices--fuel prices for farmers are so high that some do not know if they will be able to complete the harvest in the fall. And in their land, air, and natural surroundings, Americans are beginning to understand the impacts that global warming could have over the coming decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week we have already made significant progress in our quest to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Not only is the underlying bill an important step forward, but we have passed several amendments that strengthen the foundations of a new, clean energy economy for the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So far we have increased the oil savings targets in this bill by 50 percent, so that by 2016, we are saving as much oil as we are currently importing from the Middle East. We have passed provisions from the DRIVE Act that will bring high-efficiency vehicles, such as plug-in hybrids, to consumers. And we set a goal of producing 25 percent of our energy from renewable sources by 2025. These are important improvements that will accelerate the pace at which we are moving toward energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, though, I want to talk more specifically about a provision of this bill that has been a point of intense debate for some time. Vehicle efficiency standards in this country have been stagnant for too long. Although our vehicle manufacturers have made impressive improvements to the safety, strength, and power of our vehicles, the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks was actually lower in 2006 than it was 20 years ago. Passenger cars sold in the U.S. only get around 27.5 miles per  gallon on average.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The result? American consumers and businesses are suffering disproportionately from $3-a-gasoline. $50 and $80 visits to the gas station are now the norm, and transportation costs are taking a growing slice out of family budgets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People who live in rural areas are hit the hardest by low fuel-efficiency standards. They drive around 15 percent more miles than people who live in cities, they rarely have the choice of using public transit, and they use work vehicles, like pickups, that get fewer miles to the gallon. As a result, gas bills in rural households have risen almost $1,300 in the past 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question of how to improve vehicle efficiency standards is not an easy one, and is not to be taken lightly. But today the path forward is clearer than it has been in some time. Not only is the need for improved efficiency evident, but we have the technological know-how to make these changes to our vehicle-fleet in a safe and cost-effective manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us raises the CAFE standards for cars and light trucks to 35 mpg by 2020. This is a reasonable and appropriate goal for efficiency. The bill also gives manufacturers tremendous flexibility to meet the standards. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, will have the ability to set a national fleet-wide average fuel economy standard of 35 mpg by 2020 that will be tailored to the weight, size, type of use and towing capabilities of each car type. Under this flexible  system, the standards for light trucks will likely be significantly lower than the standards for passenger cars, and standards will vary for passenger cars: smaller cars will have higher standards than larger cars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also includes an important exemption for work-trucks between 8,500 and 10,000 pounds--these are the trucks that are essential to the daily operations of farmers, ranchers, and small business owners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CAFE standards in this bill are achievable by incorporating a group of modest, proven conventional technologies into vehicles. The technologies would add about $1,100 to the price of an average vehicle in 2019, an investment that would be recovered in less than 3 years of driving, assuming that gasoline costs $2.00 per gallon. Over the lifetime of the vehicle the owner would save a total of more than $3,600 in gasoline costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the technologies are only getting better. Our national labs and universities are making breakthroughs in research that will allow us to make even greater advances in fuel efficiency. At the Colorado School of Mines, for example, researchers are developing a way to cast metal alloy composite materials for high strength, lightweight vehicle parts. This technology will reduce the weight of vehicle components by as much as 60 percent without compromising vehicle performance, cost, or safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I am a champion for the responsible development of our domestic energy supplies and I firmly believe that we need to make smart investments in a renewable energy economy, improving efficiency is the cheapest, cleanest and quickest way for us to extend our energy supplies, get a handle on rising gas prices, and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of the responsible, bipartisan approach we have taken to improving vehicle standards. I want to again thank Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici for their leadership on this bill and I look forward to passing it as soon as possible.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have spoken to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and they are concerned about some ability to get in conference the cloture motion; that is, the tax aspects of the Energy bill that was defeated. It is not part of this matter we are working on now. As I told my friend, the distinguished Republican leader, if he could figure out a way to do it, he should let me know. I want everyone to cool their jets. The Republican leader and I have had a pretty good agreement  on matters that pass this body, as to what goes to conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we have preconferenced--we don't need to run through the things we have preconferenced, but I think the Republican leader will tell everyone here that I have been on the level with him, and I intend to be on this matter. So if anyone is concerned about some trick to put this energy tax package in the bill in conference, they need to tell me how to do it because I don't know how. It takes three cloture votes for me to get to conference. I have been through that. They are procedural votes.  Although I wish I had the magic wand to tell a lot of you how to vote on the procedural votes, I haven't been too successful so far.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So everyone just relax on that issue. I don't know what more I can say. I have told the Republican leader personally about that. That is how I feel.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Republican leader.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, what I assume my good friend, the majority leader, is talking about is that there are three filibusterable motions prior to going to conference. What he is suggesting here is, in fact, the case, which is that rather than simply going to conference without any discussion of what might come out of conference, the matter could be discussed in some detail before we go to conference. I know that is what my good friend, the majority leader, was talking about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our concern, of course, was that Senator Conrad said, right here on the floor of the Senate tonight--I won't read it word for word, but these are direct quotes from the floor of the Senate tonight--that was the game plan, to simply put the tax component, which was defeated earlier today, back in the measure. That created a considerable amount of angst on this side of the aisle for obvious reasons. There was substantial opposition to this massive tax increase which would have been added  to the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we will have a lengthy discussion before going to conference. Let me just say, as one of the States that does not find much to applaud in the bill in any event, there are ample reasons for voting against cloture. I certainly am going to vote against cloture and would hope that a number of our colleagues, sufficient to deny cloture, would have a similar vote.</paragraph>

  <chair> The majority leader.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to my friend the Republican leader, I hope we would proceed on the basis--I gave a little speech here earlier today, after cloture was invoked, talking about a new day having arrived. I hope people would vote the way they have in the past on this issue earlier today. It would be a real bad day for this Congress now, after the progress we have made, not to pass this bill.</paragraph>
