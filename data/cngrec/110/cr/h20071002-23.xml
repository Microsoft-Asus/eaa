  <narrative>MOURNING TAYLOR BRADFORD AND URGING CONGRESS TO PASS THE COPS BILL -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11076]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412236" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on Sunday night a football player, a young man named Taylor Bradford on the University of Memphis football team, was murdered on our campus. The football team, the City of Memphis, and the  university mourn the passing of this fine young man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We play a game tonight on ESPN2 against Marshall, and there will be a moment of silence, a moment of silence for that young man's memory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But while it is a national news event because he was a football player, he is an example of people who have senselessly been killed in this country, and there are crime problems everywhere. That is why we need to pass the COPS bill that this House has passed and the Senate should pass to provide community policing and aid for local governments to hire more policemen, to have feet on the streets to protect our citizenry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there are horror stories in Baghdad, there are horror stories in America; and we need to protect our own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will remember Taylor Bradford, and I will remember all victims of senseless crime tonight.</paragraph>
