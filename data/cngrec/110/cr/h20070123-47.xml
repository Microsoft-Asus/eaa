    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of SAM JOHNSON's resolution. I visited this fall with a Specialist William Barth at Walter Reed. I got this e-mail from his father, and I talked to his wife Rachel this morning. They encouraged me to proceed with this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is Specialist William Barth. His father said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to thank you for visiting my son, Specialist William Barth, at Walter Reed. William was injured by an IED in Iraq around September 8, 2006. He since has recovered from these injuries and he has been redeployed to Iraq. He is heading there now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>William is committed to his job and his fellow soldiers. He could have chosen to stay stateside; however, he felt the job, his job, was not finished. I have another son, Sergeant Aaron Barth, who is equally committed to the cause of freedom. Aaron has already served over a year in Iraq and is preparing to return as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Gohmert, my family is behind the President 100 percent. We are committed to the cause of freedom. Keep up the good work and do not allow anyone to defund the military. The next time you see the President, let him know that fellow Texans are praying for him, for you and for our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this is support for the troops. That is what we need to be about, not defunding these guys fighting for us.</paragraph>
