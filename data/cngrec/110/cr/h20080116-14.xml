    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, America is sliding into a full-fledged recession. Meanwhile, the President continues to pour hundreds of billions of dollars more into the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the first wars in America's history in which most Americans have never been asked to sacrifice anything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has offered no means to pay for this war spending. It is being financed solely through increased borrowing. Apparently, the idea is to borrow money, particularly from China, while driving up oil prices that benefit Iran in order to fight the war on terrorism. I am not sure that is such a wise strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We send an astounding $60 million a day to China. We now owe China $1.4 trillion. America has never been so deeply in debt to another country in our Nation's history. It is the equivalent of every American borrowing $4,000 from China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the Bush administration will announce that our trade deficit with China is $250 billion, a quarter of a trillion dollars, just this year. We have gotten ourselves into a financial vise, too dependent upon a totalitarian state. It can't continue and should not. We need better leadership, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
