  <speaking speaker="400405" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today's Wall Street Journal ran an editorial on the benefits of trade agreements. It is clear that additional trade agreements are an essential part of our economic future if we want high-quality, high-paying jobs for ourselves and our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several years ago, I formed the Economic Competitive Caucus to reveal the barriers, created by Congress, that keep us from bringing jobs back to America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lack of free trade agreements is one of those barriers, and it is clear that from the information from the U.S. Trade Representative's office that our trade has increased 26 percent with 10 of the countries that we signed trade agreements with since 2001, compared with the rest of the world, which has only grown by 13 percent. This success has meant more union jobs at U.S. manufacturers like Caterpillar, Boeing, and Cessna.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I believe America would have a stronger economy and more high-quality, high-paying jobs, including more union jobs, if Congress had approved 40 trade pacts like the Chilean Government has over the past 15 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let us tear down the trade barriers for American working families.</paragraph>
