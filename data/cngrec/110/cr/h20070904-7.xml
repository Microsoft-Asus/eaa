    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to salute the Appalachian State University Mountaineer football team on their upset of fifth-ranked Michigan this weekend in their season opener. This win was one of the greatest upsets in college football history. Before last Saturday's win, no Division I-AA team had beaten a team ranked in the AP poll from 1989 to 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mountaineers' win was no ordinary upset. It was a down-to-the-wire game for the history books. The game hinged on the heroic field goal blocked by Corey Lynch with 6 seconds left that secured ASU's 34-32 victory over one of the most storied college football programs in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this upset, it looks like Coach Jerry Moore is poised to lead the Mountaineers to their third straight national championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By beating Michigan, ASU extends their winning streak to 15 games, the longest among Division I teams. But this victory is about more than winning streaks or statistics. This is about the achievements of a hardworking championship team from a small town in rural North Carolina proving that tenacity counts.</paragraph>
