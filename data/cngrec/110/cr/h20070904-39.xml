  <narrative>NOW IS THE TIME TO DECLARE A MILITARY VICTORY IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10046]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hold in my hand the United States Government Accountability report, "Securing, Stabilizing and Rebuilding Iraq." The Iraqi Government has not met most legislative security and economic benchmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President and Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense made a surprise visit to Anbar Province in Iraq. Out of their visit, I might imagine they would hope to have a counteroffensive against a number of hearings that the majority will be holding on the question of are we safer today than we were before the Iraq war. This report is both striking and provoking, provoking Americans to realize that the policy in Iraq has failed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time now to declare a military success, a military victory. Our soldiers have done their job. They have created an opportunity for a democratic government in Iraq. But, unfortunately, the job that needs to be done by the Iraqi Government has not been done. There are no battalions that are ready to go on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I will say to the administration, a surge will not work. Staying the course will not work. I ask that the troops be redeployed and a new direction be taken in Iraq.</paragraph>
