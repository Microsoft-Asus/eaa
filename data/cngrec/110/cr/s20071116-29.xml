  <narrative>HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES -- (Senate - November 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14610">S14610</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, another month has passed, and more American troops lost their lives overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is only right that we take a few moments in the Senate to honor them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since last memorializing the names of our fallen troops on October 24, the Pentagon has announced the deaths of 72 troops. They lost their lives in Iraq and in Operation Enduring Freedom, which includes Afghanistan. One Defense Department civilian was also killed. They will not be forgotten. So today I will submit their names into the RECORD:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot forget these brave men and women. The Nation cannot afford to forget their sacrifice. We have to remember that these brave souls left behind parents and children, siblings, friends. Those left behind will feel their sorrow forever. We want them to know the country thinks about them, and we make a pledge to preserve their memory with the dignity that those who served and paid this price deserve.</paragraph>
