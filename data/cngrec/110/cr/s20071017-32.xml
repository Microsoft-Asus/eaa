    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize the city of Santa Fe and their award for one of 2007's Great Streets. Canyon Road was showcased by the American Planning Association as being one of the top 10 streets in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Canyon Road is unique in that it combines elements of commercial and residential living in a way that makes guests want to visit this street time and again. It is the heart of the residential arts and crafts district, and many artists sell their work on this street. Canyon Road is loaded with art galleries that draw crowds of art connoisseurs and simple lovers of art. Art is a huge part of the culture in Santa Fe, and Canyon Road epitomizes that culture. This street is enjoyed by locals and tourists  alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is great to see Santa Fe recognized along with cities like New York City and St. Louis. Canyon Road was listed alongside other famous roads, such as North Michigan Avenue in Chicago and Ocean Drive in Miami. It is great to see the character and distinctiveness of my State represented on lists such as these. The American Planning Association has only solidified what New Mexicans already know, that this street is a place all should enjoy. I invite all of you to visit New Mexico and go take a  leisurely stroll down the legendary Canyon Road.</paragraph>
