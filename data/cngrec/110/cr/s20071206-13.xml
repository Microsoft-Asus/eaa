  <narrative>NEW LEADERSHIP POSITION -- (Senate - December 06, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14815">S14815</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I was called off the floor just as the majority leader was saying some very nice things about me. I heard most of them, but I regret I didn't hear them all. I will ask him to repeat them privately. But in any event, it is true we are neighbors and as a result have had an opportunity to work together on a lot of items. It doesn't matter which side of the aisle we are on, we can certainly do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also appreciated the old story about the lawyers who fight for their clients' interest during the day, going at it tooth and nail, but when the day is over they get together. But as I heard the story it wasn't that they got together for a sandwich, I always thought they got together for a drink at the end of the day. But recognizing the majority leader's bent, I appreciate the story, and he certainly has my assurance that I will approach the position, which eventually I will take in a matter  of a few days, in that same spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I appreciate the comments he made.</paragraph>
