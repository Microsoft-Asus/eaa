  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>The economic disaster continues to unwind. Of course, there was reckless lending, bad investment, cheating and, yes, bad borrowing. But the major failure was of this administration and Congress over the last 7 years. I commend Chairman Frank for his understanding and resisting the rush to less regulation and oversight, while there was far more risk taken on in our economic system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a seriously flawed Senate package moving its way forward. We must remember the people who need help the most, by reforming bankruptcy laws so that we do not favor the speculator over the homeowner. Above all, we must not reward the people who got us into this mess and profited overwhelmingly along the way. American people deserve better; not just the almost 8,000 per day facing foreclosure, but the tens of millions whose neighborhoods will be harmed as a result.</paragraph>
