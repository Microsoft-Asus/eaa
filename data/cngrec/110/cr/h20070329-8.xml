  <speaking speaker="400276" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Democrats in the campaign last fall said they only wanted to raise taxes on the rich. But I think it is interesting how they define the rich. Take, for instance, the fact that they call for the lowest tax bracket of 10 percent to rise to 15 percent. Madam Speaker, the rich are not a part of the 10 percent bracket.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are going to resurrect the marriage penalty tax, costing the average married couple $466 a year more in taxes. They are going to cut the child tax credit in half, costing 31 million American families more in taxes. And if the Democrats are only raising taxes on the rich, it does seem that their definition of "rich" is anyone who is married or has children. In fact, anyone who gets a paycheck.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They said they only wanted to raise taxes as a last resort. But with the budget we will be voting on today, they have just made reservations for a long stay, with the American taxpayers footing the nearly $400 billion bill, the largest tax increase in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That didn't take long.</paragraph>
