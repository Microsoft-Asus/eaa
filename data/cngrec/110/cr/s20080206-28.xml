    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor 2LT Seth Pierce of Lincoln, NE.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lieutenant Pierce was a proud member of the U.S. Marine Corps, whose friends remember him as a dedicated and passionate person who "wore his heart on his sleeve." While attending Lincoln Southeast High School, he ran the first leg on his relay team and won the State championship in 2001. His coach described his team as "the most overachieving boys I've ever coached. They won because they were connected to each other."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A 2002 graduate of Lincoln Southeast High School and a 2006 graduate of Arizona State University, Lieutenant Pierce was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps in December 2006. Leutenant Pierce passed away due to a car accident on October 21, 2007, in Quantico, VA, where he was stationed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lieutenant Pierce is survived by his parents, Larry and Linda Pierce of Surprise, AZ; his brother and sister-in-law, Aaron and Crystal Pierce, of Omaha; and his grandparents, Edwin and Ruth Steffens and Luther and Esther Pierce, all of Lincoln. I offer my most sincere condolences to the family and friends of Lieutenant Pierce. His noble service to the United States of America is to be respected and appreciated. The loss  of this remarkable marine is felt  by all Nebraskans, and his courage to follow his dreams will remain as an inspiration.</paragraph>
