    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, what can brown do for you? You may be familiar with this phrase because it is the new UPS advertising slogan. During the past 100 years, UPS has done much for American workers and the American economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, UPS employs more than 427,000 people and is the world's largest package delivery company. It is incredible to know that this global behemoth began in Seattle, Washington, as a messenger service by a 19-year-old teenager who borrowed $100.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout 2007, UPS is celebrating its milestone 100th birthday by hosting employee events around the world. The celebration in more than 55 U.S. cities will revolve around the arrival of a mobile centennial exhibit. I was pleased South Carolina's Second Congressional District had the opportunity to participate in UPS's success when the birthday celebration came to the Midlands, and Rich McArdle was introduced as the new district manager.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
