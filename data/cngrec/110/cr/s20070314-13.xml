  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="U.S. ARMY SPECIALIST JUSTIN ALLAN ROLLINS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to U.S. Army SPC Justin Allan Rollins, of Newport, NH. Tragically, on March 5, 2007, this courageous 22-year-old soldier, along with five of his soldier comrades, gave their last full measure for our Nation when an improvised explosive device detonated near their unit during combat operations in Samarra, Iraq. At the time of this hostile action, Specialist Rollins, the gunner on his HMMWV, was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute  Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, NC, and was serving in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He had recently reenlisted in the Army for an additional 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Justin, the son of Mitchel "Skip" and Rhonda Rollins, was born on November 10, 1984, and had resided in Newport, NH, all of his life. He was a 2003 graduate of Newport High School  where he played center on the football team and threw shot put and discus for the track and field team. Those close to him describe him as a wonderful young man with a nice smile and a hearty laugh, a loyal friend, and a patriot with a strong desire to serve his country.  Family and friends say he had a zest for life and loved to hunt and drive fast cars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sensing a call to duty, and in response to the September 11 terrorist attack on our Nation, he joined the U.S. Army in 2004. Justin reported to Fort Benning, GA, where he completed basic training, infantry training, and Army Airborne School. Upon completion of his training in August 2004, he was assigned and reported to the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment at Fort Bragg. In August 2006, he deployed with his unit to Iraq. He said he went to Iraq so that the Iraqi children could  have the same opportunities as U.S. children and he was extremely proud of what he was doing. The awards and decorations that Specialist Rollins received over his years of service are a testament to his strong character. They include the Bronze Star with Valor, two Purple Heart medals, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Army Overseas Service Ribbon, Combat Infantry Badge, and Airborne Wings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Patriots from the State of New Hampshire have served our Nation with honor and distinction from the first conflict at Fort William and Mary, New Castle, NH, to the current conflict in Samarra, Iraq, and U.S. Army SPC Justin Allan Rollins served and fought in that same fine tradition. During our country's difficult Revolutionary War, Thomas Paine wrote, "These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their  country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman." In these turbulent times Justin stood with the country he loved, served it with distinction and honor, and earned and deserves our love and thanks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My sympathy, condolences, and prayers go out to Justin's parents Skip and Rhonda, older brother Jonathan, grandparents, longtime girlfriend Brittney Murray, and to his other family members and many friends who have suffered this most grievous loss. Family, friends, and fellow soldiers will no longer be able to enjoy his company. Strangers will never have the opportunity to know his friendship. Yet memories of this young patriot will last forever with those who were fortunate enough to have had  the opportunity to know him. Justin had said that there is no higher honor than to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery, and now he joins many of our country's heroes in that sacred place. Because of his devotion and sense of duty, the safety and liberty of each and every American is more secure. In the words of Daniel Webster, may his remembrance be as long lasting as the land he honored. God bless Justin Allan Rollins.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300006" topic="PRIVATE FIRST CLASS JASON D. JOHNS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I have a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Frankton. Jason Johns, 19 years old, died on February 21 while deployed in Afghanistan. With his entire life before him, Jason risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Jason moved to Florida when he was young, his valor over the course of his service in Afghanistan makes us proud to count him as a Hoosier, too. According to his father, Jason had known that he had wanted to be a soldier for as long as his friends and family could remember. He fulfilled that dream when he joined the Army in 2005, shortly after receiving his GED. Jason enjoyed the military, and he intended to make it his career, hoping to someday reach the rank of general. His father,  along with friends of the family, described him as serious about his career and a selfless man who wanted to serve his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jason died while serving his country in Operation Enduring Freedom. He was a member of the 3rd Battalion, 82nd General Support Aviation Battalion, 82nd Airborne Division out of Fort Bragg, NC. This brave young soldier leaves behind his mother and father, Kim and Jeffrey Johns, and two older brothers, Jack and Jeremiah.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I join Jason's family and friends in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will remember when they think of Jason, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of conflict and grief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jason was known for his dedication to his family and his love of country. Today and always, Jason will be remembered by family members, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I search for words to do justice in honoring Jason's sacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: "We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here." This statement is  just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain that the impact of Jason's actions will live on far longer than any record of these words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my sad duty to enter the name of Jason D. Johns in the official Record of the United States Senate for his service to this country and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like Jason's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, "He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe  away tears from off all faces."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be with all of you, as I know He is with Jason.</paragraph>
