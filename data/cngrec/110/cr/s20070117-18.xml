  <speaking speaker="300024" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to talk about a bipartisan effort to increase the minimum wage. Last week, the House overwhelmingly passed legislation to increase the current minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour. We will have a chance to deal with that in the Senate. We are going to get a better bill out of the Senate. We are going to have some small business protection which is important. But we do need to increase the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have long supported increasing the minimum wage. I strongly believe that Congress should ensure that the benefits of our strong economy go to everybody. My State of Minnesota is 1 of 29 that have sought to ease the burden for minimum wage workers by increasing the minimum wage above the Federal minimum wage. But it is well past time that Congress acted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has taken more than 9 years to finally reach the point where we will be increasing the minimum wage, and it is about time. As a result of congressional inaction, the Federal minimum wage is actually at a 50-year low, when we factor in inflation. That is simply not fair. It is not fair for our minimum wage workers who must deal with the ever-rising cost of day-to-day living.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some who argue that the vast majority of those receiving the minimum wage don't come from poor families. They claim that those receiving the minimum wage are middle income families, young, and work part time. I don't think the facts support that proposition. If Congress increases the minimum wage to $7.25, we are talking about helping about 50 percent of the workers who come from poor and low-income families. We are talking about helping out those Minnesotans who work in the nearly  230,000 low-wage jobs who would benefit from an increase. We are talking about 40 percent of hourly workers who are making $5.15 or less who are uninsured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress needs to find bipartisan solutions to reduce the ranks of the uninsured. We need to act to improve health care accessibility and affordability for all Americans, not the least of which are low-wage workers. It is important to make the point that these same uninsured Americans are also the ones who will benefit most from a hike in the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I support increasing the minimum wage, I, also, support targeted small business protection. I want to see the hit of an increase in the minimum wage lessened. It is no good to increase the minimum wage if you are going to take away somebody's job. You have to look at the impact on small business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a former mayor, a member of the Small Business Committee. I understand the importance of small business to our economy. I believe that America's future is tied to the growth of small business. Small businesses become big businesses, but they have to start small. They need the kind of protection we are talking about, bipartisan relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have introduced legislation--and apparently a bill will come out of committee--that will provide some protection. I want to make sure a couple other things are in there, such as increasing expensing for small business. My small business owners tell me this is important. Under this sort of expensing, businesses can take an immediate depreciation deduction of up to $112,000 on taxes for qualified business purchases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is important to do the right kind of protection and ensure that businesses can continue to hire workers and continue to grow and expand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the Finance Committee today for passing small business relief. I think it includes an extension of increased expensing and a 15-year straight-line cost recovery period for qualified leasehold and restaurant improvements. I am not going to get into the nitty-gritty, but we are making progress. That is good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to comment on one other aspect of the minimum wage debate that is not included in the bill out of the Finance Committee. It is called the tip credit. Although this is somewhat of a technical issue, at the end of the day this is about jobs, plain and simple.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what is tip credit? With tip credit, employers can count a certain part of their employees' tips toward meeting their employees' minimum wage. Tip credit has long been on the books. Labor laws recognize it. I know the State of New York has tip credit. I think there are 7 of the States that do not have a tip credit; 43 States have it. Again, labor laws recognize it, tax laws recognize it. It is an issue that impacts about 10,000 Minnesota businesses and their workers--mostly in the hospitality  industry, such as restaurant workers. Those are important businesses. They are gathering places in the community. They are the cornerstone of many of the communities.  They form an important part of the State's tax base. The restaurants and those folks employed there are active in the community. They sponsor the local youth teams and support schools and neighborhood projects. Restaurants are where Little Leaguers celebrate</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnesota has a minimum wage of $6.15 an hour. That is a good thing, but it is not the case in our neighboring States. I think if we look at the other chart, for instance, Wisconsin has an even higher minimum wage. Ours is $6.15 an hour, with a tip credit of $4.17. In Wisconsin, an employer pays a minimum hourly cash wage of $2.33 and can apply $4.17 of their employees' tips toward meeting the minimum wage of $6.50. The employers in Wisconsin, Iowa, South Dakota, and North Dakota in the hospitality  industry can pay employees less. There is a lower cost of doing business, which puts my employers at a competitive disadvantage. We are at risk of losing jobs in these areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have always said, the best welfare program is a job program and a housing program. Consider dining out in the border town of Moorhead, MN. Just across the river in Fargo, ND, there are more than 50 national chains, and there is only 1 in Moorhead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Operating on an unfair playing field with North Dakota and Wisconsin, hospitality establishments have to make tough decisions, such as raising prices, cutting the workforce, reducing employee hours or, worse, shutting down in the State. Peggy Rasmussen, the owner of Countryside Caf&amp;#233; in Hamel, is seriously considering closing down her business because of this tip credit issue. When businesses such as Peggy's shut down, their workers are left behind and so, too, are our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a fundamental question of fairness. Forty-three States have tip credit. All of Minnesota's neighbors have tip credit. Minnesota does not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to make it clear that any change in the tip credit law is not going to result in a lowering of this wage for Minnesotans. Anything we do needs to be prospective. I want to defend our restaurant employees. This is what they are making. Over time, we can equalize some of the disadvantage. We can do it in a way that doesn't support a tip credit that would lessen a worker's minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we increase the minimum wage, which I have consistently said is the right thing to do, let's also ensure that States such as Minnesota can operate on a more level playing field with the rest of the 43 States that have the tip credit. Without the tip credit, Minnesota's hospitality businesses and workers will continue to be hurt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout my time in the Senate, I have sought to improve the living standards of America's hard-working families. Increasing the minimum wage is one way to do so. I look forward to voting with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to increase the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that the minimum wage proposal will also allow for tip credit, which is critical to the future of Minnesota's businesses and workers, which is, in the end, about fairness and, most importantly, about keeping jobs in the States that need them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
