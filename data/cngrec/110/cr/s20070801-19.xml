  <narrative>COMMENDING WEYERHAEUSER CORPORATION -- (Senate - August 01, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10600">S10600</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300023" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize the Weyerhaeuser Corporation for its assistance in the relief efforts and the rebuilding of the gulf coast that was devastated by Hurricane Katrina in August of 2005. This outstanding company has gone well beyond the call of duty, truly exemplifying community service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Weyerhaeuser was incorporated in 1900 and is one of the world's largest integrated forest product companies. Headquartered in Federal Way, WA, Weyerhaeuser employs over 49,000 people in 18 countries. In 2005, Weyerhaeuser recorded sales of $22.6 billion and managed more than 6.5 million acres of timberland in nine States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On November 29, 2006, Weyerhaeuser received the Ron Brown Award, the only Presidential award to honor companies "for their exemplary quality of their relationships with employees and communities." The Ron Brown Award, originally established by President Bill Clinton, is named after the late Secretary of Commerce who believed that "businesses do well by doing good."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to have such a dedicated company operating in Mississippi in places such as Magnolia, Philadelphia, Richland, Columbus and Bruce. Weyerhaeuser has been operating in Mississippi since 1956 with approximately 1,700 employees at 14 locations, as well as 776,000 acres of timberland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To date, over 300 employees and retirees from across the United States have volunteered more than 42,000 hours of their time, helped rebuild more than 50 homes, and contributed more than $2.8 million for disaster relief. Weyerhaeuser has a generous policy of allowing employees 2 to 4 weeks of paid leave to help volunteer in the rebuilding efforts of the gulf coast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people touched by Weyerhaeuser's response say it best. As one family wrote in response to help from Weyerhaeuser volunteers, "Because of all your efforts, we are home! Words cannot truly express the outpouring of love we have received. We are eternally grateful to our Weyerhaeuser family."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The high caliber of Weyerhaeuser employees can be seen in their comments after volunteering on the gulf coast. One man noted, "The days were long and hot, the work was intense, but the rewards were immeasurable. This has been an experience I won't soon forget." Another volunteer employee commented, "This experience was such a blessing. I got so much more from it than I felt I gave." One Weyerhaeuser retiree said, "Having once more the opportunity to work side by side with other Weyerhaeuser  employees and retirees made me realize anew why I enjoyed working for Weyerhaeuser so much. It's all about the people and the values the company ascribes to. Thanks again." Testimonies such as these speak volumes about Weyerhaeuser's dedication to its employees and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot thank the company enough for the work they have done and continue to do. It is truly deserving of such a prestigious award, and I am delighted to see Weyerhaeuser's efforts have been recognized.</paragraph>
