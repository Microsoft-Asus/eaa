  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, some semblance of security in Baghdad, but chlorine bombs in Anbar province and other parts of Iraq, the fourth-year anniversary of this country's offensive on the nation state of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is interesting that as we continue to watch our young people fall in battle, heroes that they are, and veterans come home, that the executive in this body, this Congress, this House and the other body cannot come to grips with a forward path for solving and reconciling the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is interesting that our Commander in Chief desires to tell us that we must stay the course, a refrain that we have heard over and over again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My plea would be let us sit down at the table of reconciliation. Let us not suggest that people who stand for conscience are unpatriotic, and let us resolve to bring our troops home together in dignity and with success.</paragraph>
