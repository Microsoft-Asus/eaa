    <paragraph>Mr. President, I speak today to honor the public service of four great Ohioans--Dr. Woodrow Whitlow, Jr., Jo Ann Charleston, Dr. Rickey Shyne, and Dr. Yolanda Hicks. I am proud to honor these four NASA Glenn engineers for their achievements in the fields of science, engineering, and technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the Shores of Lake Erie, just outside the city of Cleveland, OH, world class scientists and engineers at the NASA Glenn Research Center are conducting world class research. Dr. Wilson, Ms. Charleston, Dr. Shyne, and Dr. Hicks, each of whom has contributed meaningfully to NASA Glenn's important work, are rightfully being honored at this year's Black Engineer of the Year Awards ceremony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the pragmatic, yet creative, approach taken by researchers like Dr. Whitlow, Ms. Charleston, Dr. Shyne, and Dr. Hicks that will allow this country to remain at the forefront of aerospace and space exploration technology. It is the work of the many dedicated scientists and engineers like them that drives our economy and ensures our country's future prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to honor these great Ohioans, the work of the NASA Glenn Research Center, and the many other award recipients at the Black Engineer of the Year Awards ceremony. In this new global economy, American innovation in the fields of math, science, and engineering is critical. The hard work and dedication of these four serve as an inspiration for the next generation of American innovators.</paragraph>
