  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to praise the service of a police officer from Colorado Springs: Officer Ken Jordan. Ken Jordan was killed in the line of duty early last month during a traffic stop. He was only 34.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As anyone in law enforcement can tell you, there is no such thing as a "routine" traffic stop. Every time you pull a driver over, there is the risk that something could go wrong, that this could be the one that proves too much for even your training and judgment. And yet, Ken Jordan, like countless other peace officers around this Nation do every day, set these fears aside and carried out his job with professionalism and courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Colorado Springs Police Department, Officer Jordan was a DUI specialist. His work removed unsafe drunk drivers from our roads, saving lives every time he was on duty. He was an outstanding example of his job, known to sometimes have three or four suspects lined up at Memorial Hospital in Colorado Springs, waiting to be tested for their blood alcohol level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ken Jordan was a native of Chicago, and graduated from Western Illinois University, where he studied law enforcement. In 2000, he joined the Colorado Springs Police Department and called Colorado his home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have every confidence that if Ken Jordan were here with us today, he would undoubtedly tell us of his love for the outdoors and adventure sports. He reveled in the joys of life, be it kayaking in Fiji or playing pranks on family members. His smile was as big as all the Rockies and just as ever-present.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One Denver police officer summed it up best: "He was the person you would want to have as a friend."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every time we lose a peace officer, our entire Nation grieves for them, and for their families, and loved ones. To Officer Jordan's parents and sister Sue, and to his beloved Heidi, I know that no words can ease the pain you feel at this difficult time. But through your sorrow, I hope that you can find solace in this police officers' prayer:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lord I ask for courage,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Courage to face and conquer my own fears, Courage to take me where others will not go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask for strength,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Strength of body to protect others and strength of spirit to lead others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask for dedication,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dedication to my job, to do it well, dedication to my community, to keep it safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Give me Lord, concern</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For others who trust me and compassion for those who need me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And please, Lord,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through it all, be at my side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Officer Ken Jordan's service to his community will always be honored and never forgotten. Our entire Nation stands humbled by his sacrifice, in awe of his courage, honor, and character.</paragraph>
