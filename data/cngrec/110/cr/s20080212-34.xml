  <narrative>Whereas President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stated on October 26, 2005, that "The establishment of the Zionist regime was a move by the world oppressor against the Islamic world";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas President Ahmadinejad stated on October 26, 2005, that "Anybody who recognizes Israel will burn in the fire of the Islamic nation's fury";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas President Ahmadinejad stated on October 26, 2005, that "There is no doubt that the new wave in Palestine will soon wipe off this disgraceful blot from the face of the Islamic world";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas President Ahmadinejad stated on October 26, 2005, "Is it possible for us to witness a world without America and Zionism? But you should know that this slogan, this goal, can certainly be achieved"; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas President Ahmadinejad stated on October 26, 2005, that "The skirmishes in the occupied land are part of a war of destiny. The outcome of hundreds of years of war will be defined in Palestinian land. As the Imam said, Israel must be wiped off the map";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas President Ahmadinejad stated on December 14, 2005, that "They have invented a myth that Jews were massacred and place this above God, religions and the prophets";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas President Ahmadinejad stated on December 14, 2005, that "If you have burned the Jews, why don't you give a piece of Europe, the United States, Canada or Alaska to Israel. Our question is, if you have committed this huge crime, why should the innocent nation of Palestine pay for this crime?";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas President Ahmadinejad stated on February 11, 2006, that "The real Holocaust is what is happening in Palestine where the Zionists avail themselves of the fairy tale of Holocaust as blackmail and justification for killing children and women and making innocent people homeless";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas President Ahmadinejad stated on February 11, 2006, that "We ask the West to remove what they created sixty years ago and if they do not listen to our recommendations, then the Palestinian nation and other nations will eventually do this for them";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas President Ahmadinejad stated on February 11, 2006, "Remove Israel before it is too late and save yourself from the fury of regional nations";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas President Ahmadinejad stated on April 15, 2006, that "Whether you like it or not, the Zionist regime is heading toward annihilation.

If it is true that the Jews were killed in Europe, why should Israel be established in the East, in Palestine?";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas President Ahmadinejad stated on December 12, 2006, that "Thanks to people's wishes and God's will the trend for the existence of the Zionist regime is downwards and this is what God has promised and what all nations want . . . Just as the Soviet Union was wiped out and today does not exist, so will the Zionist regime soon be wiped out";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas President Ahmadinejad stated on June 3, 2007, that "With God's help, the countdown button for the destruction of the Zionist regime has been pushed by the hands of the children of Lebanon and Palestine .....

They are occupiers and illegitimate"; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas President Ahmadinejad stated on January 30, 2008, "I advise you to abandon the filthy Zionist entity which has reached the end of the line. It has lost its reason to be and will sooner or later fall": Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the Senate--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) condemns in the strongest possible terms President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's hateful and anti-Semitic statements regarding the State of Israel and the Holocaust; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (2) calls on all member States of the United Nations to publicly condemn President Ahmadinejad's statements as a violation of the principles of both the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator LAUTENBERG of New Jersey to introduce a resolution condemning the comments made by Iranian President Ahmadinejad on Israel and the Holocaust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long, the civilized world has remained silent while the leader of Iran has threatened Israel's survival and denied the existence of the Holocaust. Since the inception of his term in office in 2005, President Ahmadinejad has continually been the mouthpiece for the vilest, most base examples of anti-Semitism and hate. Standing against this ceaselessly hostile rhetoric and threats, the State of Israel should be afforded the full support of the United States and the international community.  President Ahmadinejad's denial of the Holocaust--one of the most appalling crimes against humanity the world has ever known--is likewise unacceptable and outrageous. My colleagues and I condemn these comments in the strongest possible terms, and call for all the civilized nations of the world to do likewise.</paragraph>
