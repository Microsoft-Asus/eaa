    <paragraph>Mr. President, my colleague from Louisiana would like to enter into a discussion. Before we make any additional motions, I yield the floor to my colleague.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member for their cooperation and help on this bill. As they know, this issue and this bill is an enormous concern for all of us in coastal regions. In particular, my colleague from Louisiana and myself and the two distinguished Senators from Mississippi have been very focused on this bill and on several amendments, also, that we believe are absolutely critical to improve it as we reauthorize this necessary program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have told the chairman and the ranking member in discussions over many weeks, we have no intention to obstruct and filibuster and stand in the way of reauthorizing this important program. But we do have to have  the ability to have a fair debate and a set of votes on crucial issues, amendments that are important to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that spirit, in that vein, we took all of our amendment ideas and narrowed them down dramatically to a universe of about six or seven amendments between the four Senators from Louisiana and Mississippi. We have had productive discussions in that regard with the chairman and the ranking member. I wanted to engage in this discussion to receive assurances that the chairman and ranking member will do everything possible to ensure that our narrowed-down universe of crucial amendments gets quick,  efficient but fair consideration on the Senate floor and a vote.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleague from Louisiana and the Senators from Mississippi for their willingness to sit down and try to consolidate this so we will have a finite number of amendments that we can work through that are their particular concern. I pledge to him, as I have to his colleagues from the gulf States area as well as other coastal State Senators representing coastal areas of the country, I am determined, as I know Senator Shelby is, to move through  this bill, to give each of these amendments fair consideration, to make sure there is a full opportunity to debate them. There will be a full hearing on them. I cannot pick outcomes, but certainly the right to offer amendments, to be heard and debate them and vote on them, I am determined to make sure that happens. From my conversations with Senator Reid,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>On behalf of my colleague from Louisiana, my two colleagues from Mississippi, and myself, I thank the Senator and the ranking member again for their cooperation. We look forward to that very efficient but full and fair debate and vote on those amendments that are important to us. I will very quickly confer with the rest of them and make sure they do not have any outstanding issues, so we can move forward and get going.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. Before I make a motion, I will wait for the Senator to let me know.</paragraph>

  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, it has been a half an hour since we had the colloquy about moving forward on the flood insurance bill. My commitment to the Senators from Louisiana and Mississippi was that we would move these amendments along. In fairness, I have to say, if it takes a half an hour to obtain approval on a unanimous consent to vitiate or at least to deem the 30 hours that remain on the motion to proceed to expire so we can move to the body of the bill and amendments--I know the majority  leader wants to consider this bill. He would like to do it in the normal, routine way. Amendments are offered, debated, voted on, and move on to the next amendment. But here it is, a half an hour since we entered into that colloquy. We are here on Wednesday to complete the bill. There are about 20 amendments I am aware of--6 or 7 on the Republican side and easily that number on the Democratic side--that Members want to be considered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this bill is not done, the program expires. I can't, obviously, predict the schedule. The majority leader has that responsibility. But knowing what work we have to do in the remaining weeks, it may be difficult to get time. The majority leader has been extremely generous in providing this time so we could reconstitute the flood insurance program. In the absence of doing so, the flood insurance program will expire, as we move into hurricane season. This is the opportunity to deal with it. I  have made a good-faith commitment that I will allow for these amendments to come up, be debated, and voted on up or down. But it will be hard to fulfill that obligation if I can't even move to have the time on the motion to proceed considered expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those listening, I appreciate if we could get an answer quickly and then bring up the amendments. Then let's move on them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
