    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish a happy 70th birthday to Mr. Dennis Swanson, a kind and generous man who has been one of the leading innovators in television broadcasting over the last 30 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Swanson, who currently serves as president of stations operations at FOX Television Stations, Inc., has been called a "mastermind" of the broadcast industry. It is high praise, and very well deserved. With keen foresight, tremendous business acumen, and a willingness to take chances, Swanson has improved the fortunes of every station he has worked for. Most importantly, he did this not by offering viewers programs that appealed to the lowest common denominator, but instead he developed  creative, high-quality programming that appealed to the needs of the stations' communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1976, Swanson was hired as executive producer of KABC, Los Angeles' ABC affiliate. At that time, the station had never finished higher than third in local news ratings, and Swanson saw that the station needed to do something to offers its viewers a new perspective. In 1977, with the debate over Proposition 13 raging throughout California, Swanson invited the measure's author, Howard Jarvis, to come on the 5 p.m. newscast and debate the measure's opponents every day for a month. In addition,  Swanson worked hard to improve the quality of the station's reporting. These efforts paid off when in 1978 he was awarded the George Foster Peabody Award, the most prestigious award in broadcasting, for KABC's reporting on the Los Angeles Police Department. KABC became the No. 1 station in the region, and Swanson was promoted to station manager in 1981.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1983, Swanson was asked to take over WLS-TV, an ABC owned and operated station in Chicago with low ratings. It is here that Swanson made perhaps the best broadcasting decision of his career and one that reveals his strong character. Impressed by her audition, Swanson offered a morning show to a woman from Baltimore with a unique name. As Swanson recalled years later, Oprah Winfrey wasn't sure she was ready for such a job. She was concerned that her color and appearance would prevent her from  winning over viewers. Swanson would have none of that, "I'm not in the color business," he told her. He assured her that he didn't want her to change her appearance, but to simply "be the person I saw audition."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, the decision to hire Oprah was an unqualified success, rocketing WLS to the top of the Chicago market and eventually reaping billions in revenues for ABC. It also launched the career of one of the most influential and inspirational figures in America today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1986, Swanson moved to New York to take the helm at ABC Sports. During his tenure, ABC's top sports program, "Monday Night Football," became one of America's top-rated primetime programs, consistently ranking in the top-10 highest rated shows. He also pulled one of the most remarkable developments in sports programming history when he convinced the International Olympic Committee to stagger its winter and summer games so the Olympics would occur every other year. This decision has been credited  with keeping the public interested in the games and promoting the Olympics' message of sportsmanship and friendly competition. Additionally, Swanson was integral in the development of the Bowl Championship Series, an agreement between the four major college football bowl games that allows for the top two teams to play for the national championship at the end of each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1996, Swanson went to work as general manager for WNBC, NBC's flagship station in New York. The station was running second to longtime market leader WABC-TV, but needed a creative spark to put it over the top. As he had done in L.A. and Chicago, Swanson focused on providing viewers with high-quality community programming. He convinced network executives to broadcast the Christmas tree lighting at Rockefeller Center live during prime time. It was a huge hit. True to form, the station under  Swanson broadcast other community events, such as the St. Patrick's Day Parade and the Puerto Rican Pride day parade, ensuring that many New Yorkers who were unable to attend the parades could still feel like part of the festivities. When Swanson left WNBC in 2002, the station, like those he left in Chicago and Los Angeles, was the ratings leader for its market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After leaving WNBC, Swanson served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of Viacom Television Stations, Inc., where he oversaw 39 television stations throughout the country. While his tenure there was brief, having left for FOX in 2005, at the time of his departure Viacom's stations in New York and L.A. were increasing in market share, as were several stations in smaller markets. He now is in charge of FOX's 35 local television stations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all the success he has had, focusing solely on Mr. Swanson's professional success doesn't even allow one to scratch the surface of his rich life. Far from the apocryphal career-obsessed television executive of popular lore, for him serving the community was not just a strategy for increasing television ratings but a way of life. He has served on the boards and advisory committees of various organizations, including the Broadway Association, Inc., the National Academy of Television Arts and  Sciences, the Committee for Hispanic Children and Families, Inc, and the Ireland-United States Council for Commerce and Industry. He has also been active in efforts to promote minority voices in the media, serving as chairman of the Emma L. Bowen Foundation for Minority Interests in the Media since its founding in 1991.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who know him best say Mr. Swanson has two passions: his family and the U.S. Marine Corps. Having served in the Marines as an officer in the early 1960s, he often credits the corps with helping make him the man he is today. He has given back, raising millions for the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation and the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But first and foremost for Mr. Swanson is his family. Despite his busy schedule, he strives to spend as much time as possible with Kathy, his wife of 46 years, their three children and nine grandchildren. He makes it a point to be with them for every holiday and special event. All of his grandchildren have their grandfather attend their events, whether they are hockey games in Connecticut at 6 a.m. or theatrical plays and lacrosse games in northern Virginia or ballets and soccer games in southern  California; Dennis is always there for them</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When looking upon all that Mr. Swanson has accomplished both professionally and personally, it is difficult to imagine that there is more that he can do. Yet his dedication and creativity have proven resilient over the years, so one can only expect bigger and better things from him. I look forward to seeing what kind of new and innovative ideas he develops in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Happy birthday, Dennis Swanson. May your 70th year be your best one yet.</paragraph>
