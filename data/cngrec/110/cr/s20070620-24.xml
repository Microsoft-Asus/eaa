    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to honor and give special attention to the 100th anniversary of the establishment of Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument in my home State of New Mexico. On November 16, 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt signed the proclamation that recognized the Gila Cliff Dwellings and 533 surrounding acres as a national monument being what he called, "of exceptional scientific and educational interest ..... as the best representative of the cliff-dwellers' remains  of that region." This unique monument, nestled among the spectacular scenery of the Gila National Forest, was once the home to the people of the Mogollon, who lived along the East fork of the Gila River during the late 13th and early 14th century. It is at that place where these impressive builders</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year-long centennial celebration is more than just an appreciation for the unique beauty that is defined by the many special places like this in New Mexico. In commemoration of this special centennial event, an unexcavated surface site referred to as the TJ Ruin will be open for a limited number of guided tours. Over the next few weeks other exciting events such as Stories in the Stars, Stories in the Shards, Rock Art and Storytelling will be taking place. There will be a number of other  events, including an exhibit opening at the Silver City Museum, cowboy poetry, music, Dutch oven cooking, and Chiricahua Apache Culture Days that will be held throughout the remainder of the year to entertain those visiting the area and to celebrate the 100th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The attractive weather and abundance of forest and desert flora and fauna in the Gila region of southwest New Mexico attracts over 60,000 visitors every year who contribute to the economies of southwestern New Mexico cities and towns such as Silver City, Cliff, Deming, Bayard, and Lordsburg. With over 1,500 miles of trails, the opportunities for mountain biking, hiking, and horseback riding are endless. There is also a great abundance of wildlife that roam the Gila region. For the fisherman,  there is over 360 miles of mountain streams, creeks, rivers, and lakes that are a precious resource in the Southwest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The outdoors reminds us all of the things we hold so dear. Public lands make up over one-third of the United States, most of which is in the West. Those of us from the State of New Mexico cherish the open spaces afforded by the West. Like the Mogollon, we are reminded daily of our dependence on the land and therefore take a devout interest in its health and management. The Gila Cliff Dwellings and the Gila National Forest remain much the same as so many years ago, and I am glad this will be the  case for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next time you happen to be in New Mexico, I encourage you to come visit and take some time to enjoy all New Mexico has to offer. From the many beautiful mountains, to the rivers, the canyons, the wildlife, the culture and the history--the marvelous place we call the Gila has it all. New Mexico is a great place, and the Gila Cliff Dwellings help make it so. To all, past and present, who have worked hard to preserve the Gila Cliff Dwellings, I extend a heartfelt thank you and honor you this  centennial year.</paragraph>
