    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Food Lion, a North Carolina business success story, for 50 years of doing business the right way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Food Lion, founded in Salisbury, North Carolina, in 1957, today boasts a chain of 1,300 supermarkets spread throughout the Southeast and mid-Atlantic States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Food Lion's 73,000 employees serve more than 10 million customers every week and embody the ethic that great service in local communities is a formula for a successful and profitable business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This company has shown a true commitment to its employees by offering employees a working environment that focuses not just on good wages, but also integrates working conditions and profit-sharing arrangements that are some of the best in the retail business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And Food Lion's business model doesn't stop at the bottom line or with treating employees right. Food Lion gives back every year to many community organizations and charitable causes, including the Children's Miracle Network, America's Second Harvest Food Banks, Easter Seals, the United Way, the American Red Cross, and local schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Food Lion represents the type of company that helps make North Carolina and America great. I applaud their 50 years of service to hundreds of communities and wish them many more years of success.</paragraph>
