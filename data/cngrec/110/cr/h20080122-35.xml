  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I was here on the floor last week reminding my colleagues as my intention is to continue to emphasize those who have been hurt by the economic recession, the downtrend in our financial markets, that they are, in fact, real people. So, in the course of visiting my district and around the country, we have met individuals who are suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I met an Iraqi veteran whose parents have built their home brick by brick, and now they find that their homestead, these senior citizens, their son in Iraq, is having their house foreclosed on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met an elderly woman, a widow, whose husband was deceased 7 years ago. She's trying to pay the costliness of the heating oil and now is being called by her bank that her home, because of her delinquent payments, will be foreclosed on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is imperative I believe that an economic stimulus package include a moratorium on foreclosures in order to ensure that those individuals can reconstruct their loans. Mr. Speaker, it is imperative it is a stimulus to help people keep their homes.</paragraph>
