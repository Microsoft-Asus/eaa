  <narrative>AUTO INDUSTRY MOVING TOWARD A BRIGHTER FUTURE -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11076]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400276" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the recent contract negotiated by General Motors and the United Auto Workers was really a historic watershed for the domestic auto industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By tackling the very tough issues of pension reform and job security and, most importantly, health care reform, the industry is now poised to compete and win against foreign competitors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The domestic auto industry has momentum in moving toward a brighter future, a future that will include high-tech alternative fuel vehicles that will help us reduce our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the opportunity actually last week to check out one of these vehicles. This was the Ford Edge powered by a lithium ion battery. This is a vehicle that uses no gas and its only emission is actually water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the future if we join the cause. This Congress needs to partner with the domestic auto industry and the UAW to ensure that we produce those automobiles right here in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we should not do is enact draconian fuel economy standards that will stifle innovation, assist our foreign competitors and kill American jobs. Both management and labor are doing their jobs to strengthen the industry. Now is the time for Congress to step up and do ours. Focus on the future, focus on technology, and focus on American jobs.</paragraph>
