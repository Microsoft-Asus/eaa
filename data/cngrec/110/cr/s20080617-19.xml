    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have a vote that will occur momentarily. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate Committee on the Judiciary be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate in order to conduct a hearing entitled "Responding to the Growing Need for Federal Judgeships: The Federal Judgeship Act of 2008." It is scheduled for 2:30 this afternoon in the Dirksen Building. The witness list is remarkably good. We have the chairman of the Judiciary Resources Committee, Judicial Conference  of the United States; the Director of Homeland Security and Justice from the United States Government Accountability Office, William O. Jenkins. That would be an important hearing to go forward. As of now, we have not had consent from the minority to go forward with this.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I object. I will use a few moments of leader time to explain why.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, we need to get back to first principles around here. The Democratic majority scheduled the hearing my good friend references in a way that would violate the standing rules of the Senate. Rule 26.5 provides:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Notwithstanding any other provision of the rules, when the Senate is in session, no committee of the Senate or any subcommittee thereof may meet, without special leave, after the conclusion of the first two hours after the meeting of the Senate commenced and in no case after two o'clock ..... unless consent therefor has been obtained from the majority leader and the minority leader .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Typically, as we all know, the minority provides consent for committees to violate rule 26.5. The minority routinely provides this consent, frankly, in the interest of comity. But comity also requires the majority to treat the minority fairly which means, at a minimum, that the majority needs to keep its commitments to the minority. If commitments in this body are not kept, then comity breaks down. If that occurs, the minority will not routinely grant consent to those matters that we usually  do. In this case, we have unfulfilled commitments with respect to treating circuit court judges fairly. It is the middle of June. The Senate has only confirmed eight circuit court nominees. This is less than half the number the majority leader and I agreed to at the beginning</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican conference does not consider this lack of progress and thinly veiled threat to be, frankly, in good faith. Not surprisingly, it is, therefore, not inclined to freely give its consent to matters that are important to the majority. That is the way things work around here. As I have said before, the Senate works best when there is a spirit of cooperation. Absent that spirit, the minority will be compelled to protect its rights using all protections afforded it under Senate rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is an easy solution to the problem. We have been talking about it both privately and publicly over the last few months. The majority needs to start confirming circuit court nominees, at least those who meet the chairman's own criteria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it seems to me that before the committee spends its time creating new vacancies, which is what the hearing today was about, it needs to work  on filling the vacancies that already exist. Unfortunately, the Judiciary Committee is moving at a glacial pace toward that end. It has only held two circuit court hearings this year. Before that, it hadn't held a single one since last September. We have no indication that it is going to pick up the pace. There  are several outstanding nominees who have been sitting in committee who meet the chairman's criteria. Until they are treated fairly, the majority will find our cooperation increasingly hard to come by.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I understand that my distinguished counterpart has a right to do this, an absolute right. I don't question that right. We will just have to schedule the hearing at a different time, if they don't want to have the hearing. I will, though, briefly comment, quoting Majority Leader Lott from years past. When we go home to our respective States, there are a lot of issues. Every State has the same issues: housing problems, high gas prices, doing something about global warming.  When is the last time anyone went home and somebody said to you: Boy, are you guys going to do something about those judges? As Senator Lott said: The question never comes up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Leahy, chairman of this committee, and I have said before, this Judiciary Committee has wide-ranging jurisdiction over a lot of issues, most of which are extremely difficult to deal with. He does a remarkably good job. I am very proud that he is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. But he and I said we would do our utmost by the Memorial Day break to confirm three more circuit court judges. I think it was three; I don't remember the number. We did our utmost. Senator Leahy  did his utmost. But it was slow walked by the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee. So we are at a point now where finally we had two circuit court judges reported out of the committee last week. We are going to vote on those as soon as we can. We have fulfilled our commitment, so no one needs to talk about commitments not being fulfilled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I didn't invent the Thurmond rule. It was invented by long-time Senator Strom Thurmond, at one time chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He said  that after June 1, he felt it was appropriate not to rush into appointing more Federal judges. We have not said that the Thurmond rule is in place. But some said we should have it in place. It is well after June 1, and Senator Leahy and I are still committed to taking care of more circuit court judges. We are going to do that. I am sure there will be opportunities to take a look at some trial court judges. But we are doing our very best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I admire and appreciate the work of Senator Leahy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Will the Senator yield for a question?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Yes, I will.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask through the Chair, did the majority leader not hear the distinguished Republican leader say they don't want to give consent to these hearings that the majority may want? I was wondering if the distinguished majority leader was aware of this discussion on May 15 of this year about this judgeship act. First, I quote Senator Sessions, a noted Republican:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My comments on the judges' bill, as a member and Ranking on the Courts Subcommittee, we did have hearings several years ago but not recently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we heard from Senator Kyl, the distinguished deputy minority leader:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what I would like to do, Mr. Chairman, is just recommend that you take our colleagues up on the suggestion that we have a hearing to validate the requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At which point Senator Coburn, another Republican, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we're going to fix it, let's fix it right. Let's have a great hearing. Let's bring the GAO in, let's bring the Conference in, and let's find out [how] to do it right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then Senator Grassley, another noted Republican said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the purpose of a hearing, and that's why it is very important that we give this adequate study. I ask the distinguished leader, was he aware of the fact that this hearing was being held after four senior members of the Republican caucus asked me to have the hearing?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I say to my friend, in response to his question, yes. And the Senator from Vermont followed the advice of his colleagues and had someone from the General Accounting Office testify. I appreciate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask that we have the vote now. Members have been waiting.</paragraph>
