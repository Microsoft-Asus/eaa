    <paragraph>Mr. President, as a son of West Virginia's southern coalfields who grew up in a coal miner's home and married a coal miner's daughter, I note that today is the 100th anniversary of the Monongah, WV, mine disaster, a particularly momentous and solemn observance for the coal miners of West Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Monongah, WV, mine disaster remains today the worst industrial accident in American history. At least 362 coal miners lost their lives in that explosion on that cold December day, December 6, 1907. The truth is, some of the miners inside Fairmont Coal Company's No. 6 and No. 8 mines were boys--mere children, in fact--whose names did not appear on the company's official ledgers. So we may never know exactly how many lives were lost inside that mine on that dark day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, many more miners across West Virginia and the Nation would perish, including another 78 miners in an explosion in that same West Virginia community a little over 60 years later, before Congress would respond with the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coal miners are a different breed. Coal miners are bound together in ways perhaps not unlike the bonds that develop between soldiers or others whose occupations are inherently dangerous. Coal miners share a vocabulary foreign to most outsiders. Coal miners must place great trust in the persons next to them for their safety. Although mortal danger stalks them daily, in every minute of every day, this mutual trust and mutual dependence creates unusually strong bonds. Coal miners enjoy an unusually  deep camaraderie.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Montana, Virginia, Utah, Alabama, Wyoming, and West Virginia, coal miners are marking the 100th anniversary--that is today--of the Monongah, WV, mine disaster. They do it with reverence, and they honor their survivors. In West Virginia, we also mark December 6 as Miner Day and celebrate all coal miners--past, present, and future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coal remains today, this very moment, the backbone of America's energy supply. Over half of all the electricity we consume every day--and some of it is burning here tonight in the ceiling of this Hall--over half of all the electricity we consume every day is provided by coal miners. We must protect those coal miners. The names Alma, Darby, Crandall Canyon, and Sago remind us that mine disasters are not simply a part of the coal industry's past; they are part of our present.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we remember the miners who lost their lives at Monongah on that cold December day in 1907, let us also recommit ourselves to protecting the health and the safety of all those men and women who so bravely toil in our coal mines today. May we also take a moment to consider that the current political debate regarding the future of coal--black diamonds--in our national energy policy is taking place under lights--right here, for example--under lights illuminated by the work of coal miners, in the  warmth of furnaces fueled by coal miners and completely independent of any foreign sheik or imam, thanks to coal miners--coal miners such as my dad, coal miners such as my wife's father, coal miners such as my brother-in-law. Coal miners, coal miners, coal miners--may God bless them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
