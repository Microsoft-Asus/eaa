  <narrative>HONORING ESTHER G. KEE -- (Senate - January 30, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="490">S490</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300084" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate the work of Mrs. Esther G. Kee as she retires from the presidency of the US-Asia Institute. Mrs. Kee came to Washington, DC, in 1977 to raise awareness of the unique role Asian Pacific Americans could play in facilitating communication and interaction between the United States and the countries and people of East Asia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following the first national gathering at the White House in 1978 of Asian American leaders throughout the United States, Mrs. Kee and her colleague, the late Joji Konoshima, were encouraged by then-President Jimmy Carter to work closely with the Honorable Richard C. Holbrooke, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. An advisory council on East Asia was formed to provide insight to the State Department on issues impacting the region. From this, the U.S.-Asia Institute  was established as a nongovernmental organization in 1979 to serve as an independent voice for the U.S.-Asia relationship. Mrs. Kee and Mr. Konoshima played a key role in the historic visit of Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping to the United States, traveling with him to New York, Houston, and San Francisco, and represented the U.S. overseas on numerous delegations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Kee has worked steadily and effectively through the years to build awareness and foster mutual understanding between the United States and countries of East Asia. This quiet diplomacy has earned her the respect of many on Capitol Hill, in various administrations and in East Asia diplomatic, business, and academic circles. She has asked for no public recognition, but as she retires from the organization she cofounded, we feel it is time to say thank you for her commitment to the U.S.-Asia  relationship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From small interpersonal exchanges to facilitating contacts through international conferences at the U.S. Department of State and on Capitol Hill, the Institute has strived to strengthen ties by promoting two-way dialogue between the United States and countries of East Asia. One cornerstone of the institute's engagement was the establishment of congressional staff delegations to Asia. Since 1985, these official visits have greatly increased the awareness, knowledge and understanding of Asian  and U.S. views, providing invaluable opportunities for U.S. congressional advisers to gain a firsthand view of the region, its culture, its governments, and its people. More than 800 staff members have traveled to China alone since 1985 on 70 delegations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Kee leaves an important legacy of mutual communication and understanding, and even in her retirement, she remains determined the work she began almost 30 years ago will continue. The U.S.-Asia Institute will carry on Mrs. Kee's work, promoting dialog on international issues of common interest to the United States and participating Asian nations, whenever and however possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As she retires, we say thank you to Mrs. Kee for her sage counsel, her vision, her quiet behind-the-scenes diplomacy, and her unwavering commitment to the U.S.-Asia relationship.</paragraph>
