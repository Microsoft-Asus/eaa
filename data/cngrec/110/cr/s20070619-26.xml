    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the 2006-2007 National Hockey League champions, the Anaheim Ducks. The Anaheim Ducks demonstrated remarkable skill, teamwork, and determination in becoming the first California hockey team to win the prestigious Stanley Cup.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2006 to 2007 season will be remembered as a truly landmark season for the Anaheim Ducks. During the course of the season, the Ducks played in the franchise's 1000th regular season game and recorded their 1000th point after a much-deserved 4 to 2 victory on March 11, 2007. The Ducks began their season in fine form as they set an NHL record by remaining undefeated in regulation play for the first 16 games of the season. The Ducks used a high-octane offense and a stout defense to achieve the  first 100-point season and the first Pacific Division title in the franchise's history. Throughout the season, the Ducks were a model of hard work, dedication and consistency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the leadership of a dedicated management and coaching staff and with contributions from an outstanding roster of seasoned veterans and promising young players, the Ducks defeated the Minnesota Wild, the Vancouver Canucks, and the Detroit Red Wings in their usual spirited fashion en route to winning the Western Conference title. In the finals, the Ducks triumphed over the Ottawa Senators in a fiercely contested series that ensured the oldest and most famous trophy in all of North American  professional sports, the Stanley Cup, will finally make its way to California for the first time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my pleasure to congratulate all the hard working members of the Ducks organization who worked tirelessly to bring so much joy and pride to the people of Orange County and to the State of California. Their successes are considerable, and I salute their accomplishments. As the Anaheim Ducks and their fans celebrate their first Stanley Cup victory, I congratulate them on a truly remarkable and memorable season and wish them more success in future seasons.</paragraph>
