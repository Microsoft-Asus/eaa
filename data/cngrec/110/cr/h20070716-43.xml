    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of increasing funding for the SCHIP program and also to address health care disparities in my State of Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, the number of poor children living in Louisiana was 343,256, or 30 percent of all children in our State. Forty-seven percent of all African American children were listed as poor children, 26 percent of American Indian children, 23 percent of Asian children and 24 percent Latinos were listed as poor in my State. Of those 343,256 poor children, only 91,000 are covered by SCHIP, or as we call it in our State, LASCHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the storm, coverage for those originally enrolled in the Louisiana SCHIP program was not transferred across State lives, leaving many of the 251,000 children and adults who evacuated to other places without access to the health care they desperately need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As former President Nelson Mandela said, "There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope this House will remember that as we deal with the SCHIP funding program this time around.</paragraph>
