    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, on May 8, 2008, I missed rollcall vote No. 295. Had I been present, I would have voted in the following manner: Rollcall No. 295, "yea."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, parliamentary inquiry.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman may state his inquiry.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="NOT VOTING--29">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, in light of the conversation that the majority leader and the minority leader had last night as far as leaving votes open, and I believe the majority leader said the vote would be for 15 minutes, and then a 2-minute courtesy period, could you tell me the tally of  the vote at the end of the 15 minutes and the 2-minute courtesy period?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman has not stated a parliamentary inquiry.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order under clause 2(a) of rule XX that the vote just ended was held open for the sole purpose of reversing the outcome.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair has considered whether the new sentence in clause 2(a) of rule XX should be enforceable in real time.</chair>
  <chair>The black letter of the rule is not dispositive. It uses the mandatory "shall." It might just as well say "should," inasmuch as it is setting a standard of behavior for presiding officers. For this reason the Chair thinks it more sensible to enforce the rule on collateral bases, as by a question of the privileges of the House.</chair>
  <chair>A set of "whereas" clauses in the preamble of a resolution could allege the facts and circumstances tending to indicate a violation more coherently than they could be articulated in argument on a point of order or in debate on an appeal. The resolving clause of a resolution could propose a fitting remedy, rather than requiring the instant selection of a remedy in the face of competing demands for vitiation of the putative result, reversal of the putative result, or admonishment of the presiding  officer.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair finds that the new sentence in clause 2(a) of rule XX does not establish a point of order having an immediate procedural remedy. Rather than contemplating a ruling from the Chair in real time, the language should be understood to establish a standard of behavior for presiding officers that might be enforced on collateral bases.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, with that I appeal the ruling of the Chair.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to lay the appeal on the table.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The motion to lay on the table is not in order in the Committee of the Whole.</chair>
  <chair>The question is, Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the Committee?</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>A recorded vote was ordered.</narrative>
  <chair> This 15-minute vote on sustaining the ruling of the Chair will be followed by a 5-minute vote.</chair>
  <chair>Mr. LINDER (during the vote). Mr. Chairman, I was standing right by the gentleman who made the motion. The motion was to appeal the ruling of the Chair.</chair>
  <chair>Who changed the motion to sustaining it?</chair>
  <chair> The Chair would advise the gentleman from Georgia that the Chair put the question correctly, that it is whether the ruling of the Chair shall stand.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400242" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>That wasn't the motion. The motion was to appeal the ruling of the Chair.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question that the Chair properly put was whether the ruling of the Chair shall be sustained.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400242" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Would you tell me who changed the ruling from "appeal" to "sustain"?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair would advise the gentleman from Georgia the question on appeal is, as always in the Committee of the Whole, "Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the Committee?"</chair>
  <chair>The Chair understands that the display board initially said "appealing the ruling of the Chair," which was incorrect. So for the information of all Members of the House, in case of any misapprehension, the question is on sustaining the ruling of the Chair, not on whether an appeal shall take place.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400242" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the vote be restarted.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that we vacate this vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400242" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>So moved.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Such a motion is not in order.</chair>
  <chair>Voting will resume. All Members are advised that the question is on sustaining the ruling of the Chair. Adequate time will remain for any Member who wishes to verify his or her vote.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400242" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent again that we vacate the vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection? The Chair hears none.</chair>
  <chair>As soon as the Clerk is prepared, the pending vote will be vacated and the Chair will put the question anew.</chair>
  <chair>The question before the House is, Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the Committee?</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, earlier today I was questioning witnesses on the arts and humanities as Chairwoman of the Healthy Families and Communities Subcommittee of the Education and Labor Committee.

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I was unavoidable detained in a meeting earlier today, May 8, 2008, in the other body regarding legislation I have sponsored, and, therefore, was absent from the Chamber when rollcall votes 296 and 297 were taken. Had I been present for these two votes taken in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union,  I would have voted as follows: "aye" to sustain the ruling of the Chair (rollcall vote 296) and "aye"  on the amendment offered by Mr. ALTMIRE of Pennsylvania to <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill> (rollcall vote 297).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIRMAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this legislation represents a fair, commonsense solution that will give assistance to communities struggling to deal with the problem of vacant homes, help stabilize the housing market, and help low income families obtain a home they can afford and be proud of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Neighborhood Stabilization Act will make available to communities throughout the Nation $15 billion in new zero interest loans and grants for the purchase and rehabilitation of foreclosed properties. State and local governments have been hit hard by the foreclosure crisis not only because they have been stuck with the bill for maintaining and securing vacant homes, but also because they face decreased property tax revenues. Not only are these properties off the tax rolls, but empty houses  drive down the value of other homes in the neighborhood which further decreases tax revenues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as important, this bill will get these homes occupied by families who truly need them. A priority will be given to low income families, families who have lost a home through foreclosure, as well as first responders, veterans, public school teachers, and homeless persons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure will bring almost $600 million in assistance to the State of Michigan at a time when it is badly needed. Michigan has been particularly hard hit by the President's misguided economic policies, most especially his failure to address the foreclosure crisis. I sincerely hope that the President, who approved a $30 billion bailout for the investment bank Bear Steams, will see to it to sign and implement this bill which will provide much needed assistance to State and local governments.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIRMAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this housing package because it is imperative that Congress take action to assist homeowners struggling today. The epidemic of home losses in this country is severe, with the impact not only causing harm to the families who lose their homes, but also affecting nearby homeowners who suffer drops in their property values and communities who suffer the impact of lower tax revenues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nationally, the number of seriously delinquent loans and new foreclosures in January and February of this year was over 2.1 million, an increase of 8 percent over the previous quarter and a 55 percent increase from a year earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The housing crisis has severely impacted my congressional district, particularly the city of Cleveland, Ohio. Cleveland's weak housing market coupled with a housing over-supply has created a large number of foreclosures and abandoned properties. As of December 2007, the number of properties in Cleveland identified as abandoned, nuisance properties was 8,588. According to the Cleveland Department of Community Development, the estimated number of homes entering the tax foreclosure pool in 2008  was 1,000--with 900 homes within this pool requiring public demolition. These abandoned and foreclosed properties exist in every neighborhood in Cleveland, but there are concentrations in communities in my district where the real estate market has completely collapsed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support this housing package because it will greatly assist my constituents in Cleveland as well as thousands of Americans across the country by helping families stay in their homes while they repay their mortgage debt. This legislation will also help avoid the decreased property values and increased crime rates that often come with concentrations of foreclosed and abandoned properties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to thank Chairman RANGEL and Ranking Member MCCRERY as well as Chairman FRANK and Subcommittee Chair WATERS for their work on these important pieces of legislation. I am extremely pleased that sections of <bill type="h" number="1043">H.R. 1043</bill>, the Community Restoration and Revitalization Act, a piece of legislation I have introduced for the past two Congresses, was incorporated into the housing legislation before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill simplifies the Federal Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit, "Rehab Credit" thereby making it easier to utilize the credit for revitalizing our nation's older neighborhoods, harnessing greater housing potential in underutilized historic and older buildings, and focusing more private sector investment in smaller, "main street" oriented commercial structures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language in the bill that explicitly refers to the "historic nature" of development projects is important because, for the first time, it directs state housing agencies to create a priority within their qualified allocation plans for historic properties that can be converted to affordable housing through the use of both the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and the Federal historic tax credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the bill simplifies the rules for nonprofit and government agencies who sponsor or rent space in historic tax credit projects and significantly lowers the cost of these transactions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to simplifying the Rehab Tax Credit, the bill would also facilitate coordination of the credit with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit by exempting both credits from the restrictions of the AMT rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its inception, the rehab credit has been responsible for 133 residential and commercial projects in the city of Cleveland, leveraging about $760 million of private investment. Because of the credit, downtown Cleveland and neighborhoods like the Warehouse District, the Gateway District, and East Fourth Street are being revitalized--pumping more investment into the region and revenue to the city and State. This legislation is crucial to furthering the economic development of Cleveland and  the State of Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hope is that as we move forward we shall have the other important parts of <bill type="h" number="1043">H.R. 1043</bill> enacted, as well as further simplification and clarification of the regulations regarding nonprofit and government use of historic buildings rehabilitated with the help of the Federal historic tax credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this housing package.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400412" topic="ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIRMAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008. This bill would provide $15 billion in loans and grants, administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, for States to buy and, rehabilitate foreclosed and vacated housing properties in order to resell or rent them out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I have some reservations about the balance in this bill between loans and grants, I think the potential threat to the value of American homes and the safety of our communities justifies the overall cost. Studies have shown that home foreclosures adversely affect the value of other homes in the same neighborhood, and the rate of home foreclosures in a neighborhood directly corresponds to a spike in crime in that neighborhood. In many cases, foreclosed and vacated homes have become the dens  of vagrants, drug addicts and drug dealers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill> attempts to reduce the likelihood of these problems by helping States buy and refurbish foreclosed and vacated housing properties to make them an appealing choice for qualified families to buy or rent. In addition, this legislation includes provisions to protect against housing speculator abuse by requiring that homes purchased and refurbished by a State be resold to families whose income does not exceed 140 percent of the area median income. This bill offers further targeted assistance  for those Americans who need it most by requiring that half of the bill's grant money be dedicated to housing families at or below 50 percent area median income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill> will direct funds to the States with the greatest need. Under this bill, each State's loan and grant authority would be based on the State's percentage of nationwide foreclosures reported during the previous four calendar quarters. This is a significant point for my home State of Colorado, which has consistently ranked among the top 10 States in percentage of foreclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this bill is a good measure that deserves our support. As I previously stated, the benefits of this legislation outweigh my concerns over its cost, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400368" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation is flawed in many respects. It provides $7.5 billion in loans to cities, States, and nonprofits to buy foreclosed homes from mortgage lenders who made bad loans. That will not help people avoid foreclosures. In addition, it provides $7.5 billion in grants to rehabilitate those homes. As such, it is a giveaway to the mortgage industry that made bad loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nonetheless, Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit is a genuine attempt to improve this bill. If the majority insists on going down this path, the least we can do is to give those who have served our Nation the highest priority in receiving housing assistance under this legislation, and to make sure that those who have preyed upon our society as criminals are not helped by the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In its present form, the bill allows homes acquired and rehabilitated with taxpayer money to be purchased by convicted drug dealers, convicted sex offenders, and people who have been convicted of mortgage fraud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night our colleague, Mr. Altmire, offered an amendment that prohibits homes made available for sale under this bill, acquired and rehabilitated with taxpayer dollars, from being sold to illegal immigrants. That was a good amendment and I am glad to see that the House just now overwhelmingly adopted it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In advocating for his amendment, Mr. Altmire said that homes made available through this bill should be available only to law abiding U.S. citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues, Mr. Altmire is right. This motion to recommit brings the same commonsense to this bill that Mr. Altmire's amendment did. It simply says that homes made available under the bill cannot be sold to drug dealers, sex offenders, or people convicted of mortgage fraud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues, imagine how you would feel if your taxes were taken under this legislation and used by the government to purchase foreclosed homes, then to rehabilitate a foreclosed home in your neighborhood, and then if that house was put on the market and sold by the government to a convicted drug dealer, a convicted sex offender, or person guilty of fraud in the mortgage industry who contributed to the very housing turmoil we are now faced with. You would be outraged, and you should be.  We cannot let that happen under this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second provision of the motion to recommit corrects another defect in the bill. Yesterday an amendment was offered to provide veterans and public safety officers such as firemen and police with a preference in purchasing homes made available under this bill. The chairman of the committee quite appropriately accepted that amendment. But we can do better than that. This motion to recommit takes that concept one step further. It provides that disabled American veterans are to be accorded an  even higher preference in acquiring homes under this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, every Member in this body is aware tragically that American soldiers are returning with horrific wounds. Like many of you, I have been to Landstuhl Hospital in Germany and visited our fighting men and women. I have been to Walter Reed Army Hospital and visited them. It is wonderful that we can save their lives, but this motion to recommit recognizes and rewards their sacrifices. It provides that disabled veterans, seeking to purchase a home made available under this legislation,  must be given first preference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, these are commonsense changes to this bill that will improve it, and I urge my colleagues to adopt them by passing this motion to recommit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to the motion to recommit.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hope we are here seriously to legislate. The effect of adopting this will be to make it much less likely that veterans will get the preference. Now I understand the frustration of Members on the other side. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. McCotter) offered an amendment yesterday, notwithstanding any other preferences, first priority to veterans, members of the Armed Forces on active duty, members of the National Guard or Armed Forces reserves,  school teachers and emergency responders. That is now in the bill. That is part of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman phrased his motion as "promptly." Now we have already seen the kind of delay tactics that the minority has been prone to use. Send this back to committee, and you are very unlikely to get it back on the floor in a way in which we can pass it. So last night we adopted preference for veterans. Today, in the guise of redoing what we have already done, a motion is offered that will keep veterans from benefiting from that preference because the bill won't go anywhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman was honest. He began by saying he doesn't like this bill. And since a head-on assault will not pass--no, I will not yield. I will explain why I won't yield. I won't yield because I have consistently, when I was chairing the committee, been open to amendments. I have yielded. But when at the last minute with zero notice something is drafted with no chance to discuss it, and they use their full 5 minutes, of course I won't give up the small amount of time we have. It is already inadequate  to discuss this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this will prevent the veterans from getting the preferences they already have. You have seen what can happen with these delays. We have preference for veterans in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now let me say procedurally, if this had said "forthwith," I would have been less concerned about it. But there is also this: during the markup of this bill, we accepted nine Republican amendments. Yesterday we accepted several Republican amendments. If I was seriously interested in helping the people who are to be the beneficiaries,  I would have offered an amendment at the Rules Committee, and we would have accepted it. I would not have waited to  say "promptly" so that I would have used the disabled veterans as a way to kill the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, with regard to mortgage fraud--and by the way, this is through the cities. If you think that the cities are going to give out money to rapists, worry about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would be prepared, if this would have been put forward in an orderly way so we could vet it and not have unintended consequences as we did with the last recommit on a bill from our committee, we could have accepted it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we go forward, and let me say further in conference with the Senate, yes, I think we ought to make it explicit that people with mortgage fraud don't get it, as well as certain kinds of sex offenders. Yes, I think we can do these things, and we will do them going forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But to take it now with a "promptly," designed to kill the bill, and it will in fact undo, take back the veterans' preferences we gave yesterday, and to use disabled veterans and to use concern for the law as a cover to kill a bill for which the votes do not exist to kill it is the wrong way to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have amended this bill. Nine amendments were accepted in committee. None of these were offered. Had they been, they would have substantially been accepted, and they can be accepted going forward. But you have seen, my colleagues, what has gone on here. Send this back to committee, we have to go back to committee. We have rules to deal with. You have a crowded agenda in the committee. You will not see this bill again probably for weeks, and we will again have these tactics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from Georgia is going to raise the point that it can come out the next day. It cannot. The rules of the House do not allow it. And anyone who thinks you are going to get unanimous consent from this group to waive four and five rules is not paying attention. After we just had two votes on an appeal of a ruling, a frivolous appeal, and we get an appeal of the appeal because people didn't like the wording on the board, you tell me if you think we are going to get serious legislative  efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So, yeah, I want veterans preferences in the bill. Going forward, we can address this. But Members who are worried about some kind of ad long before your election, the sensible parts of this will be embodied in the bill. You will have a chance to vote to protect against mortgage fraud, et cetera. But vote for this today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as the gentleman from Arizona made clear, he doesn't like the bill. And I understand the problem the President has. The administration can't decide whether it wants to sign or veto. There are internal debates, so it falls to our Republican colleagues to save this President from having to make the decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues not to fall for that partisan ploy. Vote down this effort to delay, and perhaps delay indefinitely this bill. We will, going forward, take the good parts of it and incorporate it. Had they been substantially offered seriously before, they would have been adopted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please, let's not fall for a partisan ploy and kill a good bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400415" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Speaker, I rise in support of the second amendment to the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, one quarter of subprime adjustable-rate mortgages are delinquent by 90 days or more. As a consequence, during 2007, foreclosure proceedings were initiated on about 1.5 million U.S. homes. The Federal Reserve has projected that the rate of foreclosures will grow even higher in 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that many of these foreclosures are unavoidable. There are cases where investors choose foreclosure because a property's value has depreciated significantly, or a borrower's personal circumstances have changed. And, many times, as has recently become alarmingly prevalent, a borrower was put into a loan inappropriate for their circumstances. But, if a foreclosure is preventable, and the borrower wants to stay in the home, the economic argument for trying to avolid foreclosure is strong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Foreclosures impose high legal and administrative costs. Foreclosures can destabilize communities, reduce area property values and lower municipal tax revenues. And, at the national level, foreclosures add to the stock of homes for sale, increasing downward pressure on home prices, which affects the broader economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past, mortgage defaults were usually triggered by a borrower's life event, such as the loss of a job, serious illness or injury, or divorce. But the widespread decline in home prices we are witnessing today is a relatively new phenomenon and lenders, servicers and policymakers will have to develop new strategies to meet this new challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To be effective, our approach must closely target the borrowers at the highest risk of foreclosure while avoiding programs that give borrowers, who can make their payments, an incentive to default.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Th American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act will address these problems. The bill's second amendment contains several housing-related tax provisions recently reported by the Ways and Means Committee as part of the Housing Assistance Tax Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment creates a refundable tax credit of up to $7,500 for first-time homebuyers that would serve as an interest-free loan, and provides an additional standard deduction in 2008 of up to $350 for individuals and $700 for couples for state and local property taxes. It authorizes an additional $10 billion in taxexempt bonds that would be used to refinance subprime loans, finance the construction of low-income rental housing, and support loans to first-time homebuyers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To assist our men and women in uniform, many of whom have put themselves in harms way in service to their country, the amendment adds provisions from a measure approved by the Veterans Affairs Committee that extends to one year, from 90 days, the period following active duty service during which service members are protected from foreclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment will fully offset the cost of its tax provisions in two ways. First, by raising $8 billion through FY 2018 by requiring brokers to report their customer's basis in securities transactions, and second, by raising $3.2 billion through FY 2018 by delaying, until 2010, new rules allocating interest expenses between foreign and domestic sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand today in support of the second amendment to The American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008 and I urge my colleagues to join me.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation represents a fair, common sense solution that will allow homeowners to stay in their homes and help stabilize the housing market. I would like to extend my gratitude to Chairman Frank for his hard work on this legislation, which will be of critical importance in Michigan, where there are thousands of homeowners in danger of foreclosure. I am especially pleased that this bill includes legislation which I cosponsored that would provide up to $300  billion in new loan guarantees to help refinance at-risk borrowers into viable mortgages. In addition, this legislation includes important provisions that expand homeownership opportunities for veterans, seniors, and first-time homebuyers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will help both homeowners and lenders, but this is no bailout. Lenders who participate will have to take a loss, but their losses under this program will be far less than if these properties go into foreclosure. Borrowers who realize a profit when they sell their home must return some of that profit to the government. The United States provided similar leadership during the New Deal using a program run by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, HOLC. Much like the HOLC, this program  stands to save millions of homes from foreclosure at a minimum cost to the taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would especially like to thank Chairman Frank for his assistance in securing passage of a provision important to the residents of Parkview Apartments in Ypsilanti, Michigan. I have been working for four years now to try to facilitate the transfer of this property to Ypsilanti Housing Authority. Chairman FRANK and the staff of the Financial Services Committee have been instrumental in these efforts, which are designed to clarify Congressional intent regarding certain properties  that entered the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, property disposition process prior to the enactment of the Deficit Reduction Act, DRA, but where the initial proposed disposition was delayed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I believe that Parkview is already subject to the grandfathering provision of the DRA, this provision clarifies that such properties should be considered "pre-DRA" properties, and that HUD should proceed with its prior disposition contracts as to those properties. This provision is one of many that was included in legislation that passed the House last year, and is now being included in this bill as part of a comprehensive housing package. This legislation is of the utmost importance  to the Congress, and it is my hope and expectation that it will soon be enacted into law.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, The Foreclosure  Prevention Act of 2008 and the package on the floor today that will provide much-needed relief to homeowners at risk of foreclosure across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The collapse of the mortgage market that has unraveled over the last year has not only impacted homebuyers who entered into non-traditional mortgage products that they now find they are unable to repay, but has also reverberated throughout the economy. We must act with necessary urgency and pass the package before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home State of Indiana has been significantly impacted by this foreclosure crisis, which is contributing to an ongoing economic downturn. Our State has lost 27,000 jobs in the manufacturing industry since 2000. Additionally, in 2007, 53,000 Indiana homes received foreclosure notices. This number is up 74 percent from the number of notices in 2005. That means that 53,000 families in my State+ may be forced to move out of their homes, pull their children out of school and find another place to  live. Mr. Speaker, many of these people are not reckless speculators, but rather hard-working families struggling to make ends meet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This package allows lenders, investors and homeowners to voluntarily sit down at a table and work out a plan to rescue mortgages that may be on the verge of foreclosure. It takes a responsible approach to provide rescue assistance to those who most need it without encouraging irresponsible behavior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am also glad to see that this legislation includes a bill I introduced to raise loan limits on FHA Title I-insured manufactured home loans which have not been adjusted since 1992, allowing more people to enter into a mortgage that they can afford on a high-quality affordable home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, this comprehensive package includes a number of tax incentives to help prospective and current homeowners. It provides a $7,500 tax credit to eligible families to put towards their downpayment on their first home. Existing homeowners who do not itemize their tax returns for 2008 would be eligible to deduct up to $700 for property tax relief at a time they need it most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman FRANK for his continued leadership in responding to the housing and economic crisis and I urge all my colleagues to pass the Housing Rescue Package today.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400125" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, and amendments to the bill. This bill is a critical step towards stabilizing our housing market, and providing assistance to thousands of Americans facing foreclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are grave problems facing our current housing market and economy. Decreasing home values and lack of available credit are damaging the market, and skyrocketing mortgages have led thousands of families to face the frightening prospect of foreclosure. In my state of North Carolina alone, PEW Charity Trusts and the Center for Responsible Lending estimate there will be 53,254 foreclosures in 2008 and 2009. Not only does foreclosure strike at the heart of these families' financial stability,  but unfortunately the damage spreads across all of our communities. The same study shows that over 330,000 homes in North Carolina will be devalued by the spillover impact of the foreclosures, and North Carolina stands to lose over $860 million in property values.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill> is a comprehensive package that can provide relief to these families and our communities in a variety of ways. Provisions in this bill reform and modernize the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) as well as government sponsored entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These programs allow for stability in the housing market and by strengthening their loan limits and regulations, they can serve as a safer alternative to the riskier subprime loans we have recently seen. The American  Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008 also includes a tax benefit for first-time homebuyers as well as an additional credit on property taxes for existing homeowners who claim the standard deduction. These measures will help revive the housing market and get our sluggish economy moving in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also creates a voluntary FHA initiative that provides mortgage refinancing assistance to allow families to stay in their homes while also strengthening the housing market. This voluntary plan would require lenders to write-down some of the existing mortgage in order to qualify for FHA backing, and would require borrowers to return portions of any future profits on the house to the government in order to prevent foreclosure. It is important to note that under <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, only owner-occupied  homes facing foreclosure can qualify for this mortgage assistance, and speculators, investors, and second-homeowners are not eligible. This provision represents a compromise by all participating parties and can keep people in their homes and improve surrounding communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the passage of <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, and I urge my colleagues to join me.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400412" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In most circumstances, I consider it counterproductive and not in the best interest of the American people for the Federal Government to intervene in the free market process. However, in certain exceptional times, I believe it is the duty of the Federal Government to act for the greater good of our Nation. And I think we are experiencing such an exceptional moment in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provisions of this legislative package will help stabilize the downward trend in the housing industry and overall economy, and prevent that trend from spiraling out of control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The danger is real. Just last month, the Pew Charitable Trusts released a study that forecast one in 25 homeowners in my home state of Colorado will be in foreclosure within the next two years if Congress does not act now to curb this impending disaster. The national forecast of homeowners in foreclosure within the next two years--one in 33--is only slightly less discouraging. If we stand by and do nothing, as some have suggested, the damage to the overall American economy could be devastating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First and foremost, this bill will help American families at risk of foreclosure to stay in their homes by allowing the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to guarantee qualified refinanced loans. To do so, however, homeowners and their lenders must agree to sacrifice. Lenders could recover no more than 85 percent of a property's current value, but could avoid the potentially greater losses associated with unloading a foreclosed property. Meanwhile, participating homeowners could remain in their  home, but must repay the Federal Government a percentage of the value of the home if they sell or refinance again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill provides much needed measures to modernize the FHA, allowing expanded opportunities for families to secure affordable loans without having to turn to subprime lenders. The legislation also increases the Veterans Administration home loan guarantee limit, allowing our veterans to receive the dignified homeownership opportunities they deserve for honoring us with their service; reforms Government Sponsored Enterprises through strengthened regulation, while raising GSE loan limits for homes  in high-cost areas; and encourages mortgage servicers to readjust at-risk mortgages by removing the threat of lawsuit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would help remove some of the excess housing inventory by offering a refundable tax credit for first-time homebuyers. It would also provide additional mortgage revenue bonds for states to refinance subprime loans, and help prevent soldiers from being unfairly penalized for their service by providing more time to get their finances in order when they return from service before a lender could start foreclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A final important piece of this legislation would simply protect the right of States and cities to regulate their own foreclosure process. Some have argued that national banks and financial institutions should be exempt from these rules. I, however, believe it is the right of States and cities to have their own requirements and enforce their own rules throughout the foreclosure process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I was very disappointed to learn of the Bush Administration's threat to veto this legislation, because I believe that it is important for us to act now to provide relief to America's stressed homeowners. It is my understanding that Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Paulson, as well as other Administration officials, had worked with Chairman Frank to shape provisions of this legislation, so this change of heart is doubly regrettable. I hope that the  President will change his mind and sign this needed legislation when it reaches his desk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation has been carefully crafted to safeguard against fraud, corporate giveaways and speculator abuse. And as concerned as I was that the Federal Reserve had to devote $29 billion to prevent the collapse of investment bank Bear Stearns, I am equally concerned about the Federal Government taking action to rescue the housing market. However, without the stability that the Fed provided the investment banking industry, experts tell us that the bottom may well have fallen out of our economy.  And it appears the same is true for our housing market--without the stability this legislation will help provide, it may not have the chance to correct itself and, eventually, rebound. Main Street deserves the same attention as Wall Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting all three components of this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400230" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act, which will help cities and towns, but most importantly, individuals and families that have been adversely impacted by the foreclosure crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home state of Rhode Island, this problem is particularly acute. Foreclosures have increased by 20 percent in the last few months, and it is our most vulnerable communities that have been disproportionately affected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last weekend I teamed with Rhode Island Housing--a nonprofit organization dedicated to keeping housing affordable--to hold a workshop for those facing foreclosure. While we helped many local families, it is time for the Federal Government to do its part on a national scale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Chairman Frank and Chairman Rangel for their leadership in bringing this critical measure to the floor. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. This package is a comprehensive response to the current housing crisis that has left many honest, hardworking Americans in financial distress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill> is especially important to Hoosiers who have struggled as our state consistently ranks among the top ten for foreclosures nationally. The district I represent, which includes most of the City of Indianapolis, currently has around 17,000 foreclosed properties and around 7,200 in the preforeclosure phase. My constituents need the assistance available in this bill urgently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This package includes key legislation such as Government Sponsored Enterprise reform, Federal Housing Administration modernization, the Housing Assistance Tax Act and <bill type="h" number="5830">H.R. 5830</bill>, a critical bill reported out of the Financial Services Committee last week that will help borrowers at risk of foreclosure refinance into more stable loans. These bills will not only help borrowers now, but strengthen the mortgage lending market moving forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to ensure borrowers would be aware of the important FHA refinancing opportunity under Chairman Frank's bill, <bill type="h" number="5830">H.R. 5830</bill>, I introduced an amendment in the Financial Services Committee which stated that no less than 2 percent of funds available for counseling in the bill would be targeted towards notification to individuals who are eligible to refinance their mortgage under the bill's provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, we know that African American mortgage consumers were 3.7 times more likely than white borrowers to receive subprime loans and Latinos were 2.3 times more likely. In order to help those disproportionately affected by these high-cost loans, my amendment further instructed the Secretary to give preference to organizations that have a proven track record for outreach within minority communities in allocating these notification resources. I am pleased the amendment received bipartisan support  and was incorporated into this crucial piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill> is the right approach to this complex housing crisis. I thank Chairman Frank and Chairman Rangel for their hard and thoughtful work on this bill and I look forward to seeing this legislation move forward.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this bipartisan housing stimulus package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The foreclosure crisis is hurting communities all across the Nation, and my district has been especially impacted: 4,523 families in my district have already lost their homes this year. Over 11,000 families in San Bernardino County are currently in default. And the San Bernardino-Riverside area in the Inland Empire, ranked #2 nationwide in foreclosure filings this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone pays when there are foreclosures! Crime increases, home values decline, schools are affected, and cities run deficits which impacts revenues for local police, fire, and social services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act which passed today, will help stabilize communities harmed by empty homes closed by foreclosure. It will provide loans and grants to States to buy and rehabilitate these properties and restore home values in neighborhoods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The broader housing package is also important for many reasons: FHA Stabilization will allow lenders to refinance mortgages with FHA-insured loans to keep families in their homes. FHA Modernization increases FHA loan limits permanently to help high cost housing areas like the Inland Empire. The $7,500 Tax Credit for Homebuyers will help first-time homebuyers purchasing their first home. Low-income Housing Credit Reform modernizes the credit to increase affordable housing in underserved neighborhoods.  The increase in Mortgage Revenue Bonds will allow states to issue more bonds for housing and use the proceeds to refinance subprime mortgages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, my amendment to the financial services committee bill, <bill type="h" number="5830">H.R. 5830</bill>, will promote in-person housing counseling to reach homeowners in default. This is more effective than sending a letter in the mail and will help prevent many foreclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this housing stimulus package. This is the right thing to do and will keep people in their homes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation to help homeowners and families affected by the housing crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past year has been one of the most difficult ever for middle class and low-income homeowners because of the collapse of the credit markets, the weak economy, and high energy prices. It is clear to all that what began as a housing crisis has become a crisis for the entire economy and the entire country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The housing crisis put a strain on our banking system, and that has sent shock waves throughout the credit markets, for cars, for student loans, and for all consumers. American families in all walks of life are feeling the economic strain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Millions of families across the Nation have lost or are at risk of losing their homes. Foreclosures in my congressional district, Solano County and Contra Costa County, are among the highest in the country. People are looking to Congress for help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is critical that we stabilize the housing market and reduce the number of homes going into foreclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we are considering today is urgently needed. It is designed to responsibly rescue those who are facing foreclosure. It responds directly to the current crisis, but it also establishes a system to try to prevent a similar crisis in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will provide mortgage refinancing assistance to keep families from losing their homes, protect neighboring home values, and help stabilize the housing market. The federal government will step in to insure $300 billion in new mortgages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will allow FHA to insure more affordable fixed rate loans for borrowers who are facing financial troubles. It will modernize the FHA and reform the GSEs while providing crucial liquidity to our mortgage markets now, and will also strengthen regulation and oversight for the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mortgage collapse has sent shockwaves through our entire economy and it is clear that stabilizing the housing market is a critical step in strengthening our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am appalled that President Bush refuses to help American homeowners despite being perfectly willing to rescue Bear Stearns just a few months ago. It is reckless for the White House to threaten to veto this housing package that will make it easier for those in trouble to keep their homes and will help stabilize our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the President to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this legislation, we can begin to repair the economy, restore confidence in the markets, limit the damage to families and neighborhoods, and help build new affordable housing. This bill is good for hard working American families. We owe it to them to get it done.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>For the first time in a long time we have legislation that recognizes and addresses the unique housing needs and circumstances of the working poor, and other vulnerable Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We provide States and cities with incentives to ensure that low-income housing options remain available to those who need it most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We increase the allocation of Federal low-income housing tax credits and expand the authority of States to issue tax-exempt bonds to help finance affordable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 103 includes language to ensure that Federal assistance that helps vulnerable populations, like the elderly, the sick, and veterans, does not reduce the value of the Federal low-income housing tax credits used to finance affordable rental housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 104 allows for consideration of whether an affordable housing development employs technology and practices to improve its energy efficiency, when Federal low-income housing tax credits are allocated to affordable housing developments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 104 also clarifies that students who were formerly in foster care are not precluded from renting affordable housing financed by Federal low-income housing tax credits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation touches the lives of real Americans who have been left behind or outright forgotten for too long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we fail to meet the needs of vulnerable Americans, then we will fail to live up to our responsibility of governing on behalf of all people.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act, and <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These bills come at a critical time for America--and especially for my constituents on the Central and South Coasts of California. That is why I am extremely disappointed that the President has threatened to veto them both.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They include much-needed reforms of the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, and usher these agencies into the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But they also accomplish three tasks that are vital to the housing market and economy of the Central and South Coasts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act makes permanent the temporary loan limit increases contained in the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I cannot stress enough how vital this provision is for my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Median home prices in Ventura, Santa Barbara, and San Luis Obispo Counties are well above the national average, and our families are truly struggling to obtain affordable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, this bill will stem foreclosures by creating a voluntary mortgage refinancing program that allows families to stay in their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this program, the Federal Housing Administration has the authority to refinance up to $300 billion in imperiled mortgages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With median home prices in Santa Barbara County alone declining almost 30 percent in the past year alone, it is undoubtedly in the best interests of lenders to participate in this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act establishes a loan and grant program for the purchase and rehabilitation of foreclosed homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just this week one of my hometown newspapers, the Ventura County Star, reported on the negative impact that foreclosed homes have on communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lower home values, increased crime, and safety hazards are just a few of the consequences that can result from foreclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill prevents neighborhood decline by providing targeted assistance to state and local governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, American families need help, and that is exactly what is provided by the housing bills on the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support these bills, and I urge the President to work together with Congress in addressing the needs of the hard-working families in America who want to keep their homes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400253" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This vital legislation comes at a time of record-breaking gas prices, double digit increases in food prices and a weakening economy. On top of all these struggles, Americans now face a crisis at home and in their communities in the form of rising property foreclosures. In some parts of the country, neighborhoods are littered with "for sale" signs, and many families are struggling to keep up with their mortgage payments. The legislation we are debating on this floor today will empower communities  to respond to the current home mortgage crisis, prevent further lending abuses and increase federal oversight of the mortgage industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill> expands the Federal Housing Administration's role in preventing foreclosures by expanding refinancing loan guarantees for at-risk homeowners. Today, families are facing variable interest rates, hidden fees, early payment penalties, but with enactment of the Foreclosure Prevent Act, the government will be there to provide relief and counseling. It also increases oversight to ensure regulators have the tools to prevent the next crisis. It expands housing counseling and consumer protections.  The bill also establishes an affordable housing trust fund to provide assistance for low income households. The bill even makes it harder to foreclose on the homes of our returning troops from Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also contains important language to my district and my hometown of Malden, Massachusetts. The tenants of the Heritage Apartments face an uncertain future, with an HUD affordability contract expiring soon. The tenants are facing possible displacement once an outstanding HUD mortgage is fully paid in a few years. The development is also in need of major renovations and upgrades that simply cannot be delayed. Unfortunately HUD is failing to ensure that the development remains affordable  and livable by placing burdensome restrictions on prepayment of the outstanding mortgage and subsequent transfer to a new owner who is willing to finance the renovations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Language in this bill would allow income-eligible residents to qualify for enhanced housing vouchers following the prepayment of the HUD mortgage and the property transfer and directs HUD to approve such actions. I want to thank the Chairman of the Financial Services Committee (Mr. FRANK) for his assistance in ensuring that this important provision is included in this housing bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, with this legislation, we are taking steps to revitalize our communities for a better tomorrow. I strongly urge this House to vote to approve this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400377" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, over the past months, economic conditions in our country have soured. Particularly troublesome to our Nation's economic engine are skyrocketing home foreclosures and loan delinquency rates, which have risen over 85 percent in the past year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Foreclosures and delinquencies are harmful to borrowers and lenders, but they also stifle economic growth, shake consumer confidence, and lower home values for those who live near foreclosed properties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While borrowers in our country must certainly bear a great deal of responsibility when it comes to financial planning, the government can and must carefully examine the impact of soaring mortgage foreclosures on the whole U.S. economy and also thoroughly review regulatory oversight with respect to the mortgage business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been pleased that the House has been active in addressing the mortgage crisis, voting last year to strengthen consumer protections against risky loans and to overhaul the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Freddie Mac, and Fannie Mae, among other things. Under the leadership of Financial Services Committee Chairman BARNEY FRANK, the House is again poised to pass critical, market-driven housing legislation designed to reduce foreclosures, to help families avoid foreclosure in  the future, and to alleviate the negative impacts of foreclosures on property values and the national economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to support this legislation, which would create a new voluntary program within FHA that would offer lenders an alternative to foreclosure. This approach, which is driven by the lenders' desire to save costs associated with foreclosing on property, forces the lender, the borrower, and the government to all make sacrifices to ensure families have the ability to stay in their homes. While some have criticized this initiative as a government bailout of those who have made poor financial  choices, in my view, it represents an innovative, market-driven way to shore up the housing market and the overall economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure would also create a $7,500 tax incentive for first time home buyers and other important tax incentives while simultaneously modernizing the FHA, Freddie Mac, and Fannie Mae and increasing the loan limit for FHA and Veterans' Administration loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am hopeful that the Senate will act quickly on this well written bill and that it will be signed into law by the President.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, the Foreclosure Prevention Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of last year, home foreclosure rates rose to the highest level in 20 years. Every day more than 7,000 people file for foreclosure, and it is predicted that predatory lending practices and sub prime mortgages will cause one in every thirty-three homeowners to foreclose on their mortgages in the next 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not an issue that is merely affecting those who have defaulted on their mortgages and their lenders; it is having a ripple effect throughout the economy. It has resulted in a nationwide decrease in housing prices of 12.4 percent, and 10 percent of Americans now owe more money on their mortgages than their homes are worth. It has caused a decrease in consumer confidence and corresponding decrease in consumer spending. It has contributed to a steep increase in job losses in housing related  industries such as manufacturing, construction and related industries. These job losses combined with the loss of consumer confidence could reduce economic activity by over 150 billion dollars in 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a crisis, and it is time, it is past time, that the Federal Government step in and help those that are suffering. <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill> would provide mortgage refinancing assistance to keep families in their homes, protect neighboring home values, and help stabilize the housing market. It would expand the Federal Housing Administration to help borrowers who are at risk of losing their homes to refinance into lower-cost government-insured mortgages that they can afford to repay. <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill> ensures  that this will be done responsibly, by requiring lenders and mortgage investors to take significant losses in order to participate in this program and by requiring borrowers to share a portion of any resale of a refinanced home with the government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill> also provides 11 billion dollars in tax incentives to help Americans purchase a first home or hold onto the ones that they already have. This includes tax credits to first-time homebuyers, an additional 10 billion dollars in mortgage revenue bonds for states,  and improves access to low-income housing. It also includes a provision that I wrote to allow homeowners who currently do not itemize their Federal tax returns to take an additional standard  deduction for the state and local property taxes that they pay. The Temporary Tax Relief Act creates an additional standard deduction of $350 for single filers and $700 for joint filers for state and local real property taxes paid or accrued. This legislation will complement efforts that have already been implemented on the state and federal level to help address the housing crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that several organizations in my home state of New Jersey have stepped in to provide services and assistance to New Jerseyans who are at risk of losing their homes. One of the shining examples of this is Legal Services of New Jersey. LSNJ created the Anti-Predatory Lending Project 5 years ago to provide legal services to borrowers victimized by predatory lenders. LSNJ's hardworking lawyers have helped almost 500 families who were facing foreclosure receive legal assistance. I would  like to commend LSNJ for the work that they have done on behalf of the residents of my central New Jersey district and for all New Jerseyans who have been at risk of losing their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill> and the companion bill that the House of Representatives will be considering, <bill type="h" number="5818">H.R. 5818</bill>, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act are a bold step towards addressing the mortgage crisis and the resulting economic downturn, and I urge my colleagues to support them.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400210" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the amendments to <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, which the House is considering today. This urgently needed legislation makes a number of surgical reforms to help address the problems we are currently facing in our Nation's housing markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, I am pleased that one of the amendments that we will consider today contains <bill type="h" number="5579">H.R. 5579</bill>, the Emergency Mortgage Loan Modification Act of 2008. I have worked with the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. CASTLE) to refine his original proposal and introduce a new bill. We also held a productive hearing on <bill type="h" number="5579">H.R. 5579</bill> before the House Financial Services Capital Markets Subcommittee and made a number of revisions to the bill before bringing it to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the hearings on <bill type="h" number="5579">H.R. 5579</bill> and throughout its legislative development, I have been clear about the intended goals of this legislation: to provide servicers a safe harbor from investor lawsuits. Servicers, in turn, would have to meet prescribed duties and enter into a "qualified loan modification" or "workout plan" which the legislation defines. It is my firm belief that with such an arrangement in place, servicers will more readily assist troubled homeowners and will have more tools  at their disposal to prevent defaults and foreclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, I would like to be clear about what the bill does not intend. <bill type="h" number="5579">H.R. 5579</bill> does not intend to create a statutory preference for loss mitigation activities generally, nor does it limit the ability of servicers to pursue the full scope of available options. In drafting this legislation we sought to create a bill that honors the terms of existing contracts while at the same time recognizing that foreclosure is not in the best interests of the investor or borrower.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, Mr. Speaker, Americans have been hit hard both by the current housing crisis and by the broader credit crunch. We can delay action no longer. I therefore urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, and especially the incorporated language from <bill type="h" number="5579">H.R. 5579</bill>.</paragraph>
