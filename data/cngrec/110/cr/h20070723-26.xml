    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arizona?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400162" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Congressman Jim Saxton, for introducing <bill type="h" number="465">H.R. 465</bill>, the Asian Elephant Conservation Reauthorization Act of 2007. <bill type="h" number="465">H.R. 465</bill> would authorize the Asian Elephant Conservation Act through fiscal year 2012. This law authorizes grants to be issued for the survival of the Asian elephant in the wild.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the status of the Asian elephant remains tenuous. Fewer than 4,000 Asian elephants are found throughout the forests and savannas of South Asia. Approximately 16,000 of these animals are held in captivity. The captive elephants are used to assist people in timber harvest, forest clearing and agriculture. In the wild, populations remain under heavy stress from several factors, especially habitat loss and deforestation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the first grant was awarded in 1997, more than $10.3 million in matching contributions or in-kind support have been generated by leveraging the $7.8 million contribution made available by the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Funding supports cooperative conservation projects that protects Asian elephants and their habitat by providing scientific research, law enforcement and education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support this noncontroversial bill, and again commend the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton), the author of the original Asian Elephant Conservation Act, for his unwavering commitment to international wildlife conservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="465">H.R. 465</bill>, the Asian Elephant Conservation Rauthorization Act. This legislation will extend the Asian Elephant Conservation Fund at the existing authorization levels until September 30, 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the early 1900s, there were less than 40,000 wild Asian elephants living throughout the world. In response to this international wildlife crisis, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton) introduced the Asian Elephant Conservation Act. Since 1997, the Secretary of the Interior has reviewed over 300 proposals to assist Asian elephants, and 183 grants have been awarded to various entities. These projects have received $7.8 million in Federal funds and $11.3 million in private matching  funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This conservation fund has had a profound impact on protecting Asian elephants, and there is no question that these projects have stopped this specie's slide into extinction. This is a sound investment of a small amount of Federal tax dollars. I urge an "aye" vote on <bill type="h" number="465">H.R. 465</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr Speaker, as the author of this legislation, I am pleased the House is now considering <bill type="h" number="465">H.R. 465</bill>. This simple non-controversial legislation will extend the Asian Elephant Conservation Fund at existing authorization levels of up to $5 million each year until September 30, 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During our public hearing on <bill type="h" number="465">H.R. 465</bill>, the Fish and Wildlife Service, which administers this Fund, testified that: "The Asian Elephant Conservation Act has greatly enhanced the conservation status of the Asian elephant".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are currently only about 40,000 wild Asian elephants living in south and southeastern Asia. As a result, this species is listed on our Endangered Species Act, on Appendix I of CITES and on the World Conservation Union's Red List.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response to the ongoing slaughter of this keystone species, Congress adopted the Asian Elephant Conservation Act which I was pleased to sponsor in 1997. In the decade since its enactment, the Secretary of the Interior has carefully reviewed over 300 conservation projects designed to save Asian elephants for future generations. The Secretary has approved 183 of these grant proposals which  have received $9 million in Federal funds and $11.3 million  in private matching funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As every witness testified, there is an overwhelming need to extend this important conservation program and there is no question that these conservation funds have had a profound impact on protecting this irreplaceable species. While everyone enjoys seeing elephants at the National Zoo, it is far more important that they continue to exist in the wild in Burma, India and Thailand. The road to extinction is a one-way street and we must work to ensure that the Asian elephant does not make that journey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to urge my colleagues to vote "aye" on <bill type="h" number="465">H.R. 465</bill>, the Asian Elephant Conservation Reauthorization Act. It is an appropriate and sound investment of U.S. tax dollars.</paragraph>
