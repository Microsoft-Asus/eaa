    <paragraph>Madam President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business for an hour, the time equally divided and controlled between the two leaders. Republicans will control the first half and the majority controls the final 30 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason we did not go immediately to the bill at this time is there is a very important markup taking place in the Finance Committee dealing with the Energy bill, particularly the tax portions of the Energy bill. It is my understanding that Senators Boxer and Grassley, with other members of the committee, have worked out a bipartisan measure they will bring to the floor as an amendment in the immediate future and it will be done today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once morning business closes, the Senate will then immediately resume consideration of the Energy bill about which I referred. Under our order of yesterday, the Senate will debate the Bunning and Tester amendments for a total of 2 1/2  hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the time for debate for these two amendments this morning be equally divided and controlled as previously ordered until 1 p.m., and that the Senate then recess until 2:15; that at 2:15, the remaining debate time also be equally divided and controlled, with the other provisions of the previous order remaining in effect.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="ORDER OF PROCEDURE">
    <paragraph>The agreement just entered now delays the conference recess period until 1 p.m. Following disposition of those two amendments this afternoon, the Senate will then debate three more amendments with the total debate time up to 90 minutes. Votes on these amendments will occur upon the use or yielding back of that time, so Members should expect two votes around 3 to 3:15, and then three more votes around 5:30.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have conferred in detail with the distinguished Republican leader going over the schedule. I have told Democratic Senators, and I will repeat this at the caucus, we have a lot to accomplish before this work period ends. We have to complete the energy legislation, we have to complete work on the immigration bill, and we have to start defense authorization in some manner, recognizing that we will not have a lot of time on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is up to the individual Senators as to how much time we take. If all time is used--as I said, I have gone over this in detail with the Republican leader and our staffs--we will not be able to finish until Saturday, a week from this Saturday, sometime in the evening. That would mean we would have to be in session this weekend. Maybe we have some people who may not object to one or two things. That being the case, we may not have to be in on Sunday this week. But everyone should understand,  we have a lot of important votes. We have people running for President on both sides of the aisle. They should plan on being here, because their votes could make the difference. The energy legislation is extremely important. There are three issues that are the main focus of this  legislation, by the business community, the environmental community, and the press. That is coal to liquids--that matter is going to be resolved this afternoon, hopefully; CAFE, which hopefully will be resolved</paragraph>
