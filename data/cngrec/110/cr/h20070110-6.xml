    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the President's proposal that he will announce tonight to increase rather than decrease the number of troops in Iraq defies the reality on the ground and the advice of our wisest military commanders. This decision will only serve to put more forces in the crossfire of a growing civil war. If there ever was a justifiable mission to depose a ruthless dictator, that mission has been accomplished. The Congress never authorized this military occupation. It is irresponsible  and, in fact, immoral to allow more innocent American lives to be lost in vain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iraq is an artificial nation that was created by Winston Churchill and Gertrude Bell in 1922 to promote their concept of British imperialism. The reality is that this was never a winnable war for the United States of America nor in my view is it a sustainable civil society, and adding more troops is not going to change that reality.</paragraph>
