    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have come to the floor to pay tribute to a good friend, Janez Drnovs 0ek, who passed away on Saturday. Dr. Drnovs 0ek served as the second Prime Minister of Slovenia from 1992 to 2002, and as President from 2002 to 2007. In these and other capacities, he played a truly historic role in giving birth to a free and independent Slovenia, while avoiding the bloodshed and warfare that engulfed other nations as they seceded from the former Yugoslavia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Drnovs 0ek was born on May 17, 1950, in Celje. He graduated from the University of Ljubljana's Faculty of Economics. In 1986, he finished his doctoral studies in economic science at the University of Maribor. In 1994, he received an honorary doctorate from Boston University. In 2004 he was named Protector and Honorary Senator of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts in Salzburg.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Dr. Drnovs 0ek will be best remembered as a statesman of enormous ability, vision, and courage. A brilliant economist, he unleashed the entrepreneurial spirit of the Slovenian people and played a historic role in establishing his new nation as a robust democracy with one of the most successful economies in Central and Eastern Europe. Today, thanks in large measure to Dr. Drnovs 0ek's leadership, Slovenia is a full member of the European Union and NATO, and a force for stability and democratic  reform across the Balkans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The world looks at Slovenia's success in the nearly 17 years since she declared independence, and it wonders: How could a nation of just 2 million people accomplish so much in so short period of time? As an American, I know the answer. Bear in mind that, when Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, America was also a nation of just 2 million people. Like Slovenians in 1991, Americans in 1776 dared to break away from a much larger and more powerful mother country. Like Slovenians, Americans  demanded a democratic course for their new country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the most important parallel between our two countries is this: Historians of the American Revolution have marveled that a tiny nation of just 2 million people was blessed with such an extraordinary collection of thinkers and leaders, including Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin. At this crucial crossroads in Slovenia's history, it, too, has been blessed with extraordinary leaders. And Dr. Drnovs 0ek will be remembered as one of the most talented of these Founding Fathers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal note, I was very fortunate to spend time with President Drnovs 0ek during my trip to Slovenia in August 2005. Clearly, he was an independent thinker and a free spirit. One obituary in the Washington Post on Sunday noted that in his youth and early adulthood, he was a member of the Communist Party, which was the only political force in the former Yugoslavia. But he was never a Communist at heart, and he made a point of going off to ski whenever the party held a congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, with the passing of Dr. Janez Drnovs 0ek, the world has lost an important leader and a wonderfully decent human being. He was instrumental in founding and nurturing a free, democratic, successful Slovenia. History will not forget him, nor will the citizens of his grateful nation.</paragraph>
