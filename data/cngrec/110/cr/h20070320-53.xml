  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we are here today to announce a new series of weekly topics for the Congressional Constitution Caucus. I found that many Americans, including some of my fellow Members, are not as familiar with the Constitution as they might want to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Thursday this was demonstrated to us when three local schoolchildren, ages 8 to 12, came into the office. They were wearing these little "Liberty Day Kids" T-shirts and buttons, and they announced that they were going to door to door in the buildings asking congressional offices questions in honor of James Madison's birthday, questions such as what is necessary to override a Presidential veto, or where do all of the appropriations bills originate from.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Out of curiosity we asked them if most people had been answering the questions correctly, and the children emphatically shook their heads no. So tonight and each Tuesday after votes, we hope to help correct that problem by taking a walk through the Constitution, and I encourage other Members to join us as we educate each other and the Nation about our preeminent founding document.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we begin by looking at the Preamble of the Constitution. It is perhaps one of most well-known sections, the Constitution's introductory sentence, which reads, "We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this passage sums up in a condensed version what the Founders were intending in this document. So let's look at some of the phrases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first phrase, "We the People of the United States." Now, these words by themselves almost sound trite today, but they were groundbreaking pronouncements when they were written. You see, the previous document, the Articles of Confederation, was an agreement solely between the States, and other earlier documents, including the 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France and the 1783 Treaty of Paris did not even include the word "people."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In convincing Virginia to ratify the Constitution, the Governor explained to them why the word was appropriate. He said, "The government is for the people; and the misfortune was, that the people had no agency in the government before. If the government is to be binding on the people, are not the people the proper persons to examine its merits or defects?" The Constitution therefore binds America together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next phrase is "In order to form a more perfect Union." The Founders simply believed that the new government would be stronger than the one under the Articles of Confederation. You see, the loose confederation of States had led to bickering and ineffective government. But this new arrangement of States has allowed the States to retain their power, but also work together for the common good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thomas Jefferson wrote therefore, The union is the last anchor of our hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third phrase is "to establish Justice."</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This refers to a problem that had arisen in the State court systems. And so by creating a Supreme Court of the land, the Framers hoped to prevent egregious examples of trampled rights. But the Framers had a higher purpose in mind, too. In Federalist No. 51, James Madison wrote: "Justice is the end of government. It is the end of civil society. It ever has been and ever will be pursued until it be obtained, or until liberty be lost in the pursuit."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next section is to provide for the common defense. This phrase is perhaps the most evident today. See, the War for Independence had been fought for that very reason; and in the years following the war, our fledgling Nation had been unable to defend itself against the Barbary pirates and also from Spain and England threats. So the States realized they needed to unite to preserve the Union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next one is very important for today. The phrase "to promote the general welfare," this has been commonly interpreted to mean that the Federal Government can do almost anything as long as it accomplishes something beneficial. But you see, this definition ignores the Founders' real intent. See, they deliberately used qualifying words such as "general" because they meant to limit the powers rather than expand it. Think about it. Would it be proper and fair for the Federal Government to  recognize certain groups over other ones, certain States over others? If the Founding Fathers didn't intend to create these special rights or special privileges or socioeconomic programs, there would not have been any reason to list the specific powers that are listed in the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>James Madison even stated that the "general welfare" clause was not intended to give Congress an open hand "to exercise every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common defense or general welfare."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final section reads "to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity." These words come from the previous phrase, for without law, it is impossible to achieve liberty for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will close by saying we look forward each week to come to the floor on Tuesdays as we walk through the Constitution week after week to better understand this important document for this House and for this country.</paragraph>
