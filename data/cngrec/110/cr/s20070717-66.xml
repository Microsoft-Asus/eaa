  <speaking speaker="400629" topic="Introducing S. 1811. A bill to amend the Toxic Substances Control Act to assess and reduce the levels of lead found in child-occupied facilities in the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environmental and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1811">S. 1811</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Lead Poisoning Reduction Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two weeks ago, the Washington Post featured an article on lead research by the economist Rick Nevin. Mr. Nevin's work demonstrates a strong link between lead exposure and criminal activity in our country. Specifically, he found that national spikes in rates of children with lead poisoning were significantly correlated with spikes in criminal activity two decades later. Notably, this finding was not unique to the U.S., he found a similar association in 9 other countries, despite differences in  economics, demographics, and values. Although many readers, myself included, were surprised by Nevin's findings, the scientific community was not, having known for many years that lead poisoning leads to irrevocable, toxic effects on brain development of young children. These effects lead to changes such as impulsivity and impaired cognition, which appear to contribute to criminal behavior in later years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Nevin's work underscores the critical importance of eliminating lead poisoning in children, which is completely preventable and has tragic consequences. In the U.S., over 300,000 children have blood lead levels of 10  micrograms or higher, the level traditionally considered to indicate "lead poisoning". Yet, even this level is now considered unsafe as newer research has indicated that lead-related damage starts at much lower levels. We must remain  vigilant in tackling all sources of lead exposure, to save future generations of children from harm, and the Lead Poisoning Reduction Act will help to do just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The major source of lead exposure among U.S. children is lead-based paint and lead-contaminated dust found in deteriorating buildings. The Lead Poisoning Reduction Act will provide $42.6 million in grants to communities that wish to develop and implement lead amelioration programs for their childcare facilities. It directs EPA to promulgate regulations within 18 months that require new child-occupied facilities to be certified lead-safe before opening for business. Additionally, EPA would also  promulgate regulations within 5 years of enactment to require that all non-home-based childcare facilities be lead-safe. Further, my bill requires EPA to conduct a study of State, tribal and local programs designed to protect children from lead exposure in child-occupied</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reducing lead hazards in our communities, especially in child-occupied facilities, is critical, with impact reaching beyond individual children in preschools in any given city, to our society as a whole. It is the right thing to do, and the smart thing to do, and it should have been done years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I call on my colleagues to support the Lead Protection Reduction Act, which will help to ensure that every child has access to safe, lead-free childcare facilities in this Nation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300022" topic="Introducing S. 1812. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to strengthen mentoring programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1812">S. 1812</bill>] Mr. President, research indicates a caring adult can make a difference in a child's future. Today, I am pleased to introduce legislation that will expand the mentoring programs found in the No Child Left Behind Act. If adopted, the Mentoring America's Children Act of 2007 would help close America's "mentoring gap" and match more at-risk students with high-quality mentors. I thank my colleagues, Senators KERRY, AKAKA, and BAYH, for joining me on this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mentoring programs are a cost-effective way to expand a young person's ability for success. Studies have shown young people with mentors perform better in school and are more likely to graduate and go on to higher education. Mentors also play a role in improving the social and emotional well-being and reducing the negative behaviors of the children they mentor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the positive effects of having a mentor, nearly 15 million young adults are still in need of mentoring. These young people encompass America's "mentoring gap." That is why I have joined with my colleagues to introduce the Mentoring America's Children Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation broadens the reach of mentoring to include specific populations of young people who could particularly benefit from a mentor's involvement, including children in foster care and kids in communities with a high rate of youth suicides. It also provides much needed training and technical assistance to grantees, tracks youth outcomes, strengthens research on the effects of mentoring, and improves the sustainability of grant recipients. Finally, this bill allows students to gain professional  skills while working with mentors by establishing internship programs during the school year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mentoring plays a key role in improving the learning environment for a young person, as mentored youth have better attendance and are more connected to their school, schoolwork, and teachers. Mentors serve as role models, advisors, and advocates for the children they mentor. We must work together to match even more high-quality mentors with our neediest children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is supported by MENTOR/National Mentoring Partnership, Big Brothers Big Sisters of America and the National Collaboration for Youth. I ask my colleagues to join me in approving this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, our Nation's children are our greatest resource. They represent the future of this country and we should do everything we can to foster their growth and ensure they lead happy and productive lives. That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Mentoring America's Children Act of 2007 which was introduced today by Senator CLINTON. This important legislation highlights the significant impact mentoring can have on a child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Research has shown time and time again that mentoring is an important component to a child's development. Often these children come from broken homes or communities affected by violence. The relationship formed between a mentor and a child helps support their studies in school, their relationships with their families at home, and gives them the confidence they need to withstand the pressures they are faced with. Our children are confronted with much more than some of us even realize. By providing  a mentor, parents and teachers have another line of defense in allowing our children to grow up in a safe nurturing environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The consequences of letting young people grow up without a support system are dire. In 2006 America's law enforcement officers arrested approximately 250 teens an hour, and it's estimated that 900,000 of our children are victims of abuse and neglect. Studies show that most teens that use alcohol, cigarettes and marijuana do so before they are 14. This is unacceptable. We must do more to foster these children so they stay in school, keep clean and out of trouble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mentoring can help improve the social and mental well being of a child so they can deal with the myriad of challenges they face. Massachusetts has many notable mentoring programs that have affected thousands of children's lives. Strong Women, Strong Girls is a program started by a Harvard graduate that matches local university women with girls in targeted communities to help create another generation of strong women through mentoring. The Boys and Girls Club has a long and storied history in  my State as does the Big Brother Big Sister program. A study of Brother Big Sister showed that children that benefited from their program were 46 percent less likely to use drugs, 52 percent less likely to skip school and have fewer conflicts with their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mentoring America's Children Act would help these programs and others like them across the country. It builds on the mentoring programs already put in place in the No Child Left Behind Act by ensuring that they are as effective as possible. The bill provides for additional training and technical resources as well as studies the efficacy of these various programs. More importantly, it widens the net of children that can be helped by mentors by focusing on children in the foster care system  and those that live in communities with high suicide rates. We should be focusing our energies on helping the children most in need and providing them with mentors that can enrich their lives and help them succeed.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="Introducing S. 1814. A bill to provide individuals with access to health information of which they are a subject, ensure personal privacy with respect to health related information, promote the use of non-identifiable information for health research, impose criminal and civil penalties for unauthorized use of protected health information, to provide for the strong enforcement of these rights, and to protect States' rights; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1814">S. 1814</bill>] Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator KENNEDY, the distinguished Chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor Pensions, in introducing the Health Information Privacy and Security Act of 2007, HIPSA. This comprehensive health privacy bill will ensure the right to privacy with respect  to health information for millions of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In America today, if you have a health record, you have a health privacy problem. The explosion of electronic health records, digital databases and the Internet is fueling a growing supply and demand for Americans' health information. The ability to easily access this information electronically, often by the click of a mouse, or a few key strokes on a computer, can be very useful in providing more cost-effective health care. But, the use of advancing technologies to access and share health information  can also lead to a loss of personal privacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Information Age, the traditional right and expectation of confidentiality between patient and doctor is at great risk. Without adequate safeguards to protect health privacy, many Americans will simply not seek the medical treatment that they need, nor agree to participate in health research, because they fear that their sensitive health information will be disclosed without then consent or knowledge. And those who do seek medical treatment must assume the risk of the unauthorized disclosure  of their health information due to a data security breach or other privacy violation. The loss of health privacy is a growing threat to our national health care system that the Congress must address.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator KENNEDY and I both firmly believe that a fear of a loss of privacy cannot be allowed to deter Americans from seeking medical treatment. We are introducing this legislation today to close the privacy gap with respect to Americans' electronic health information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A guiding principle in drafting our health privacy bill has been that the American people will only support efforts to move toward health information technology if they are assured that their sensitive health information will be protected from unauthorized disclosure and from the growing dangers of identity crimes posed by data security breaches. The bill that we are introducing today takes several important steps to honor this principle and to protect the health privacy of all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, our bill guarantees the right of every American to privacy and security with respect to the use and disclosure of their health information. Under this legislation, every individual has the right to inspect and copy his or her own health records and to receive  notice of the privacy rights and practices of data brokers and others who store this information in electronic databases. Our bill also ensures the security of electronic health information by requiring that data brokers establish safeguards to secure health information from data security breaches and other unauthorized disclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, our bill places meaningful restrictions on the disclosure of sensitive health information. The bill expressly prohibits the disclosure or use of health information without a patient's authorization and requires that any health information intended to be used for medical research first be stripped of personally identifying information to protect an individual's privacy. There are exceptions to these restrictions for law enforcement, public safety and national security purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill also requires that patients be notified of a data security breach involving their health information within 15 days of discovery of the breach. The bill provides for important exceptions to this notice requirement for law enforcement and national security reasons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirdly, our bill addresses the growing fear of many Americans that they will not be able to obtain important health information about a parent or child in situations involving a medical emergency, because of confusion about the requirements of current health privacy laws. The New York Times recently reported that many health care providers are overzealously applying health privacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, HIPAA, thwarting the legitimate efforts of  family members, caretakers and even law enforcement to obtain critical health information about patients in their care. Our bill expressly allows health care providers to disclose health information to law enforcement for legitimate purposes and to a patient's next of kin, provided</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, our bill contains meaningful civil and criminal enforcement provisions to discourage and punish the wrongful disclosure of Americans' sensitive health information. The bill makes it a Federal crime to knowingly and intentionally disclose or use sensitive health information without an individual's consent. Violators of this provision are subject to a criminal penalty of up to $500,000 and up to 10 years in prison, if the violation is committed with the intent to sell or use sensitive health  information for economic gain. In addition, the bill authorizes the Attorney General to file a civil action in Federal district court to obtain civil penalties from entities that fail to adequately safeguard electronic health records, or to provide consumers with information about their health privacy rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator KENNEDY and I have worked on this legislation for more than a decade and we both understand the need to carefully balance the right to health privacy with the legitimate needs of health care providers, medical researchers and public health and law enforcement officials. Our bill strikes the right balance between protecting privacy and ensuring public safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have also conferred extensively with the many stakeholders in the health care community in crafting this legislation and our bill is supported by a wide range of public policy, consumer and health care organizations from across the political spectrum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator KENNEDY and I believe that the right to health privacy is of vital interest to all Americans. For this reason, and on behalf of the millions of Americans who are currently at risk of either foregoing medical treatment or losing their right to health privacy, I urge all Senators to join us in supporting this important privacy legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a copy of the July 3, 2007, the New York Times article entitled "Keeping Patients' Details Private, Even From Kin," be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <narrative>Keeping Patients' Details Private, Even From Kin</narrative>
  <narrative>(By Jane Gross)</narrative>
  <narrative>An emergency room nurse in Palos Heights, Ill., told Gerard Nussbaum he could not stay with his father-in-law while the elderly man was being treated after a stroke. Another nurse threatened Mr. Nussbaum with arrest for scanning his relative's medical chart to prove to her that she was about to administer a dangerous second round of sedatives.</narrative>
  <narrative>The nurses who threatened him with eviction and arrest both made the same claim, Mr. Nussbaum said: that access to his father-in-law and his medical information were prohibited under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or Hipaa, as the federal law is known.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Nussbaum, a health care and Hipaa consultant, knew better and stood his ground. Nothing in the law prevented his involvement. But the confrontation drove home the way Hipaa is misunderstood by medical professionals, as well as the frustration--and even peril--that comes in its wake.</narrative>
  <narrative>Government studies released in the last few months show the frustration is widespread, an unintended consequence of the 1996 law.</narrative>
  <narrative>Hipaa was designed to allow Americans to take their health insurance coverage with them when they changed jobs, with provisions to keep medical information confidential. But new studies have found that some health care providers apply Hipaa regulations overzealously, leaving family members, caretakers, public health and law enforcement authorities stymied in their efforts to get information.</narrative>
  <narrative>Experts say many providers do not understand the law, have not trained their staff members to apply it judiciously, or are fearful of the threat of fines and jail terms--although no penalty has been levied in four years.</narrative>
  <narrative>Some reports blame the language of the law itself, which says health care providers may share information with others unless the patient objects, but does not require them to do so. Thus, disclosures are voluntary and health care providers are left with broad discretion.</narrative>
  <narrative>The unnecessary secrecy is a "significant problem," said Mark Rothstein, chairman of a privacy subcommittee that advises the Department of Health and Human Services, which administers Hipaa. "It's drummed into them that there are rules they have to follow without any perspective," he said about health care providers. "So, surprise, surprise, they approach it in a defensive, somewhat arbitrary and unreasonable way."</narrative>
  <narrative>Susan McAndrew, deputy director of health information privacy at the Department of Health and Human Services, said that problems were less frequent than they once had been but that health care providers continued to hide behind the law. "Either innocently or  purposefully, entities often use this as an excuse," she said. "They say `Hipaa made me do it' when, in fact, they chose for other reasons not to make the permitted disclosures."</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Rothstein, one of Hipaa's harshest critics, has led years of hearings across the country. Transcripts of those hearings, and accounts from hospital administrators, patient advocates, lawyers, family members, and law enforcement officials offer an anthology of Hipaa misinterpretations, some alarming, some annoying:</narrative>
  <narrative>Birthday parties in nursing homes in New York and Arizona have been canceled for fear that revealing a resident's date of birth could be a violation.</narrative>
  <narrative>Patients were assigned code names in doctor's waiting rooms--say, "Zebra" for a child in Newton, Mass., or "Elvis" for an adult in Kansas City, Mo.--so they could be summoned without identification.</narrative>
  <narrative>Nurses in an emergency room at St. Elizabeth Health Center in Youngstown, Ohio, refused to telephone parents of ailing students themselves, insisting a friend do it, for fear of passing out confidential information, the hospital's patient advocate said.</narrative>
  <narrative>State health departments throughout the country have been slowed in their efforts to create immunization registries for children, according to Dr. James J. Gibson, the director of disease control in South Carolina, because information from doctors no longer flows freely.</narrative>
  <narrative>Teaching staff to protect records is easier than teaching them to share them, said Robert N. Swidler, general counsel for Northeast Health, a nonprofit network in Troy, N.Y., that includes several hospitals.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Over time, the staff has become a little more flexible and humane," Mr. Swidler said. "But nurses aren't lawyers. This is a hyper-technical law and it tells them they may disclose but doesn't say they have to."</narrative>
  <narrative>Many experts, including critics like Mr. Rothstein and proponents like Ms. McAndrew, distinguish different categories of secrecy.</narrative>
  <narrative>There are "good faith nondisclosures," as when a floor nurse takes a phone call from someone claiming to be a family member but cannot verify that person's identity. Then there are "bad faith nondisclosures," like using Hipaa as an excuse for not taking the time to gather records that public health officials need to help child abuse investigators trying to build a case.</narrative>
  <narrative>Most common are seat-of-the-pants decisions made by employees who feel safer saying "no" than "yes" in the face of ambiguity.</narrative>
  <narrative>That seemed to be what happened to his own mother, Mr. Rothstein said, when she called her doctor's office to discuss a problem. She was told by the receptionist that the doctor  was not available, Mr. Rothstein said, and then inquired if the doctor was with a patient or out of the office. "I can't tell you because of Hipaa," came the reply. In fact the doctor was home sick, which would have been helpful information in deciding whether to wait for a call back or head for the emergency room.</narrative>
  <narrative>The law, medical professionals and privacy experts said, has had the positive effect of making confidentiality a priority as the nation moves toward fully computerized, cradle-to-grave medical records.</narrative>
  <narrative>But safeguarding electronic privacy required a tangle of regulations issued in 2003, followed last year by 101 pages of "administrative simplification."</narrative>
  <narrative>Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, a sponsor of the original insurance portability law, was dismayed by the "bizarre hodgepodge" of regulations layered onto it, several staff members said, and by the department's failure to provide "adequate guidance on what is and is not barred by the law." To that end, Mr. Kennedy, along with Senator Patrick M. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, plans to introduce legislation creating an office within the Department of Health and Human Services  dedicated to interpreting and enforcing medical privacy.</narrative>
  <narrative>"In this electronic era it is essential to safeguard the privacy of medical records while insuring our privacy laws do not stifle the flow of information fundamental to effective health care," Mr. Kennedy said.</narrative>
  <narrative>This spring, the department revised its Web site, www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa, in the interest of clarity. But Hipaa continues to baffle even the experts.</narrative>
  <narrative>Ms. McAndrew explained some of the do's and don'ts of sharing information in a telephone interview:</narrative>
  <narrative>Medical professionals can talk freely to family and friends, unless the patient objects. No signed authorization is necessary and the person receiving the information need not have the legal standing of, say, a health care proxy or power of attorney. As for public health authorities or those investigating crimes like child abuse, Hipaa defers to state laws, which often, though not always, require such disclosure. Medical workers may not reveal confidential information about a patient or case  to reporters, but they can discuss general health issues.</narrative>
  <narrative>Ms. McAndrew said there was no way to know how often information was withheld. Of the 27,778 privacy complaints filed since 2003, the only cases investigated, she said, were complaints filed by patients who were denied access to their own information, the one unambiguous violation of the law.</narrative>
  <narrative>Complaints not investigated include the plights of adult children looking after their parents from afar. Experts say family members frequently hear, "I can't tell you that because of Hipaa," when they call to check on the patient's condition.</narrative>
  <narrative>That is what happened to Nancy Banks, who drove from Bartlesville, Okla., to her mother's bedside at Town and Country Hospital in Tampa, Fla., last week because Ms. Banks could not find out what she needed to know over the telephone.</narrative>
  <narrative>Her 82-year-old mother had had a stroke. When Ms. Banks called her room she heard her mother "screaming and yelling and crying," but conversation was impossible. So Ms. Banks tried the nursing station.</narrative>
  <narrative>Whoever answered the phone was not helpful, so Ms. Banks hit the road. Twenty-two hours later, she arrived at the hospital.</narrative>
  <narrative>But more of the same awaited her. She said her mother's nurse told her that "because of the Hipaa laws I can get in trouble if I tell you anything."</narrative>
  <narrative>In the morning, she could speak to the doctor, she was told.</narrative>
  <narrative>The next day, Ms. Banks was finally informed that her mother had had heart failure and that her kidneys were shutting down.</narrative>
  <narrative>"I understand privacy laws, but this has gone too far," Ms. Banks said. "I'm her daughter. This isn't right."</narrative>
  <narrative>A hospital spokeswoman, Elena Mesa, was asked if nurses were following Hipaa protocol when they denied adult children information about their parents.</narrative>
  <narrative>She could not answer the question, Ms. Mesa said, because Hipaa prevented her from such discussions with the press.</narrative>

    <paragraph>In 1996, the Senate enacted HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which I introduced with Senator Kassebaum. That law gave Americans the ability to continue their health insurance when they changed jobs. It has become clear, however, that the privacy rules under the act have not succeeded in protecting patients adequately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since HIPAA became law, numerous privacy bills to protect personal health information have been introduced in Congress, but none of them has been enacted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, the HIPAA law required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop privacy regulations if Congress failed to enact privacy rules by August 1999. When Congress did not act, the Department of Health and Human Services prescribed privacy rules, but its authority to do so under HIPAA was limited to regulating only the privacy-related activities of three specific "covered entities," health care providers, payers, and clearinghouses. Other entities, such as schools, employers,  and health agencies, can be regulated only indirectly, as business associates of covered entities, even though many of them also possess confidential health data.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This indirect oversight has made it very difficult to enforce implementation of the Department's safeguards for entities other than the three specifically listed in the HIPAA privacy rule. The result is that Americans continue to be at risk of having their personal medical records and other confidential health information wrongly distributed and exposed without their authorization, and often even without their knowledge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One common problem involves domestic and offshore outsourcing. HIPAA-covered entities and business associates can hire outside companies, either in the U.S. or in other countries, to do work for them. The tasks of those outside companies may require them to obtain personal health information. There is widespread concern, however, that once this private information leaves the original holder, the legitimacy of any subsequent disclosure of it becomes much more difficult to enforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obviously, we need to revise our approach to health information privacy in order to protect the rights of those who rely on their doctors and their Government to safeguard their private information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The pending health information technology bill, <bill type="s" number="1693">S. 1693</bill>, was the subject of much discussion on this issue. Some feel that the bill should include more extensive privacy regulations than it does. But that measure is not the best vehicle to restructure health-information privacy. Attempting to rewrite privacy rules through health IT legislation would be a piecemeal approach to correcting the shortcomings of privacy protections. The Health Information Privacy and Security Act presents an opportunity  to make comprehensive improvements to health privacy protections. Addressing health information privacy through this legislation will ensure the security of patients' information, in any form, electronic or otherwise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that Senator Leahy and I are introducing today corrects the longstanding errors in the ways in which confidential patient information is handled and distributed. We live in a time when Americans are increasingly aware of breaches of their privacy. It is essential for us to enact effective reforms to protect all Americans from further infringements on their health privacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The system now in place allows much of importance to fall through the cracks. Enforcement has been inadequate. The Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for the enforcement of HIPAA, has received more than 20,000 complaints, but it has not imposed any civil penalties in response. The Department of Justice has effectively prosecuted only four criminal violations of HIPAA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few examples illustrate the problem. In June 2006, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid reported that the health information of 17,000 Americans whose insurance plans are provided by Humana, Inc. was at risk because of unsecured computer data. Last September, the Government Accountability Office urged Medicare to implement stronger oversight over the transmission of private health records. A GAO survey had found that almost half of all responding Medicare Advantage contractors admitted to  recent breaches of privacy of health records. In addition, the number of health plan providers that identified themselves as "mostly compliant" with HIPAA's privacy regulations decreased from 91 percent in 2005 to 85 percent in 2006. These findings demonstrate that patients' right to know and authorize who views their medical information is being neglected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans live in a democracy where they believe, rightly, that they themselves should have the power to decide when, and to whom, their health information is disclosed. The bill we are introducing today will better enable Federal privacy rules to fulfill that expectation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill complements and strengthens Federal privacy regulations by adding more effective oversight and individuals' access to their own personal information. It requires the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to revise the HIPAA Privacy Rule to make it consistent with this act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill gives each American the full ability to obtain and modify any of their health records, whether the records are carried by one of the HIPAA Privacy Rule's three "covered entities" or by any other entity. Except in rare cases, authorization by an individual is required before any other person or entity can disclose, obtain, or use that individual's protected health information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also addresses the existing outsourcing problem by improving transparency. Any entity that entrusts outside agents or overseas providers with personal health information must publish their names and ensure that they abide by the required privacy and security measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The act requires all entities that deal with protected health information in any way to implement safeguards to protect that information. Such entities must also maintain safeguards that are up-to-date with current technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Any entity that possesses or obtains an individual's protected health information is required to give that individual a notice of privacy rights and practices, including the individual's right to be alerted if a security breach concerning the information occurs. Individuals are also promised a clear description of who will have access to their personal health information and how the information will be used. In this way, people will always be aware of what is going on with their private information.  They will feel more secure about it, and be more secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also establishes a demonstration grant program to help those who have low health literacy or limited english-language proficiency to exercise their privacy rights and avoid cultural or linguistic barriers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Act also creates a new office in the Department of Health and Human Services, the Office of Health Information Privacy, which will oversee investigations of alleged violations and verify compliance with the act. This office will also be responsible for establishing and implementing standards and product certifications for systems and networks that handle protected health information. Until now, many entities have been confused about how to implement health privacy regulations. This new office  will help them understand Federal privacy rules, so that they can conduct their business accordingly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Federal privacy regulations now in place also make it difficult to prosecute illegal activities. The Office of Health Information Privacy will be charged with resolving this problem. It will do so in part by instituting penalties for wrongful sharing or use of private health information by any entity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Overall, a delicate balance must be struck. On one hand, we must allow the sharing of information necessary for effective health care. At the same time, however, we must protect Americans' right to have their health records and individual health information kept private. For too long, the balance has been tilted too far against patient privacy, and our bill is a needed effort to correct that imbalance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans deserve stronger guarantees of patient privacy, more helpful guidelines for security implementation, and more dependable enforcement and penalties for the misuse of protected health information. I look forward to the early enactment of this legislation to achieve these important goals.</paragraph>
