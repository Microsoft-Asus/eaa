  <speaking speaker="400383" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, people in Arkansas who knew of Judge Richard Arnold admired and respected his great legal mind, his integrity, and his remarkable attributes as a human being. Everyone who personally knew him liked him. Not even those who disagreed with him found fault with his judicial demeanor nor his legal analysis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we have an opportunity to honor this great man. Tomorrow in Little Rock will be the formal dedication of the Richard Sheppard Arnold United States Courthouse, a wonderful new facility. Not only will this building be a great site for justice in central Arkansas, but it will be a lasting tribute to Judge Arnold. And on this day also we honor his wonderful wife, Kay Kelley Arnold, who will be in attendance at tomorrow's dedication.</paragraph>
