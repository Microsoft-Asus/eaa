  <speaking speaker="400644" topic="">
    <paragraph>After months of campaigning against "Stay the Course," the Democrats are proposing just that, a stay-the-course resolution here on the House floor. Their Iraq resolution does not have the force of law, and in fact, this nonbinding resolution is simply a mealy-mouth attempt to appease their Democrat leftist base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats have held 52 hearings on Iraq since taking control of Congress. So let me get this right. The Democrats have held 52 hearings so they can show one resolution on the House floor that has no bearing on the President's policy, does not have the force of law, does not advocate the withdrawal of troops, and does nothing except have a tantrum here on the House floor. So please explain this new direction, Madam Speaker. This is not a new direction, it is political posturing of the worst kind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, where is your plan? Where is your plan for victory in Iraq? Where is your plan for success and national security?</paragraph>
