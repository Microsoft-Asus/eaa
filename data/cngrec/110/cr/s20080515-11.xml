    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on May 15, 2008, at 3 p.m., in executive session, to conduct a markup of the following: an original bill entitled "The Federal Housing Finance Regulatory Reform Act of 2008"; <bill type="h" number="634">H.R. 634</bill>, "American Veterans Disabled For Life Commemorative Coin Act" and an original bill to make technical corrections to title II of the SAFETEA-LU bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, the bill the chairman of the Banking Committee, the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, is speaking about is over 400 pages long. It has been amended verbally numerous times over the past week. We are going to have a meeting at 3 o'clock today. None of us has seen the bill. None of us has seen the amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have tremendous respect for the chairman of this committee. He is, to me, one of the best Senators in this body to work with. I respect the ranking committee member. I know time is of the essence, if you will, as to addressing some of the issues that are in this bill. I am very disappointed that today at 3 we are going to be going through a very technical bill many Senators in this body, candidly, may not ever take the time to look at because of the technicalities that exist and the specialties  that will be addressed, if you will, by this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very tempted to object to this, not because it is taking place today at 3, but because of the fact that we do not have any of the documentation regarding the agreements that have been made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Out of my respect for this chairman and out of my respect for the ranking member, I will not object at this time. But I will say, in the future I hope for a technical bill such as this that is more than a few lines--something that is over 400 pages long--there will be time to actually go through the bill prior to a very strenuous markup. I in no way assert any negativity toward the Senator. I know he is doing the best he can to hold this bill together. I know there are a lot of competing interests.  It is actually out of respect for him trying to do the job he is doing today, in order to move something forward in this body, that I will not object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I appreciate the Senator not objecting, but let me, for the purpose of the record, inform him that the committee print has not been changed. There were no verbal agreements. The bill was available a week ago for anyone to read. It was in the Congressional Record. It has been on a Web page as well so the public at large could read it here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a long involved process, an involved process. The only reason we are meeting at 3 today is because of the request of the ranking member to delay the markup this morning. I am here to work out some additional provisions. I want to let my colleague know that. I appreciate my colleague very much. He is a very active and constructive member of the Banking Committee, but this is a product that has been available for people to review almost for a week now, before the markup actually was to occur  this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate his not objecting. We will see how things progress. Nonetheless, we will keep working at it, but his involvement will be critical.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412248" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to say that portions--while no doubt we have the original text, it is my understanding negotiations were taking place throughout the night. I was getting e-mails at 1:30 in the morning regarding the negotiations, and yet I have seen no written copies of any of the agreements that have been made. I would say that would be nice to see prior to a markup of this type, but again out of respect I will not object, and thank you very much for this colloquy.</paragraph>

  <chair> The majority leader is recognized.</chair>
