  <narrative>DOCTOR'S PAYMENT FIX -- (Senate - December 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="15895">S15895</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400621" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to address the issue of what is commonly referred to as the Medicare "doctor fix." Unless Congress acts, there will be a 10-percent reduction to Medicare reimbursement rates in the coming year; putting good doctors further at odds with Medicare payments for their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a problem that not only affects patients with Medicare but also our military veterans, many of whom rely on Medicare as their primary health care provider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Delaying the issue will put our veterans relying--on Tricare until the age of 65 and Medicare after retirement--at increased risk of additional health problems if their ability to see a doctor remains in question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If not addressed, millions of Americans could be denied immediate access to treatment when they need it most. It would also put an even greater strain on doctors, who are already forced to be selective in determining which Medicare patients they can treat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a choice no doctor should have to make, and our seniors and doctors deserve better. We have the opportunity to act before we leave in the coming days, and I urge my colleagues to consider the consequences that would result from an additional cut to the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of Florida, the dilemma has reached a critical mass, with an increasing number of doctors leaving the program--refusing to continue treating a very vulnerable population. All because the bureaucracy is too much and reimbursement is too low.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are doctors that play important roles in treating seniors in their communities. These are doctors like Dr. Troy Tippett, a neurosurgeon in Pensacola, who is often faced with the choice of continuing to treat Medicare patients at a loss or refuse them because of declining reimbursements from Medicare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Tippett was so worried about the threat of further cuts to the Medicare reimbursements he receives, he recently called to let me know the detrimental impact the declining reimbursement rate would have on his ability to continue treating Medicare patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope for the sake of good doctors like Dr. Tippett we can develop a comprehensive, long-term solution that fixes this problem once and for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a problem, I believe, that we must fix soon, rather than kicking the can down the road and hoping the next Congress will provide an answer to the more than 40-million Medicare patients. But today, we can do our part by opposing a cut to the broken payment system that penalizes our doctors for treating Medicare patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We owe it to the people who have worked so hard in life and need quality care now more than ever. We also owe it to the doctors who treat them on a regular basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support fixing the reimbursement rate that so many doctors in my State--and around the country--depend on, especially in the face of rising medical costs and skyrocketing medical malpractice insurance premiums.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding that we are very close to coming to agreement on a doctor fix and that floor action could occur very soon. I am hopeful we will have the opportunity to approve that fix. We must act because our physicians and their patients are counting on us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while I am pleased we are about to address the problem--let's not make the mistake of leaving it as a short-term fix. The American people deserve a long-term solution. I look forward to coming back next year and working on a permanent "doctor fix."</paragraph>
