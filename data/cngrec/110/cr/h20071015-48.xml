  <narrative>OVERRIDING THE VETO ON SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11533]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in a little less than 72 hours, this House will have the opportunity to make one of the most definitive and powerful stands for the Nation's children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me go on record by indicating that this Nation has over a period of time mistreated her children. Now we have the opportunity to insure millions of children with health coverage through the SCHIP program, a program now that has seen itself last for a decade of success in preventing devastating health conditions for young children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know this because just last week I visited St. Joseph's Hospital, the neonatal unit. We heard stories from young mothers talk about children who have been saved and, yes, talk about those who have not been saved because they could not enroll in the SCHIP program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why in the world would we suffer a veto to deny our children a mere $35 billion to cover them for preventative health care?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to overturn this veto, and I join the Congressional Black Caucus to ensure that that happens. The fight is for our children. We cannot yield.</paragraph>
