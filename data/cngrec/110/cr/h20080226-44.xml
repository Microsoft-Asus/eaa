  <narrative>REINVESTING TAXPAYER SUBSIDIES -- (House of Representatives - February 26, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1056]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Israel) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400195" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this week the House will vote to reinvest taxpayer subsidies from the most profitable oil companies in the world to the American people in the form of lower gas prices, lower home heating oil costs, and new jobs in clean, renewab le technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 6 years under Republican management, we attempted a strategy to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and to lower gas prices. The strategy was to provide $14 billion in industry subsidies to the largest oil companies in the world, the most profitable oil companies in the world. So $14 billion to them, and at the same time the Bush administration submitted budgets to this Congress that actually reduced funding for renewable energies, for energy efficiency, for weatherization, for sol ar, for</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so what was the result? The result was this: Gas prices doubled; home heating oil prices tripled; oil company profits quadrupled, but the average American was now faced with an additional $1,500 in gas prices. And at the same time as oil company profits went up and as pocketbooks got lower and lower, the wallets of the American people lost more and more value, we actually increased our dependence on foreign oil. This year we are actually imp orting 1.6 million barrels of oil a day more than</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So we're actually more dependent on foreign oil, and the American people are less well off. Oil companies did very, very well. But we did nothing to reduce our dependence on fo reign oil, and the American people lost $1,500 in the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, we're going to change that. We have the opportunity to change that this week. We're going to pass, I hope on a bipartisan basis, a new approach, a new strategy, a fundamental change in energy policy. And we're going to redirect those subsidies from oil companies to the pocketbooks of the American people. We're going to create as many as 3 million jobs in renewable technologies. We're going to invest those subsidies in the creation of n ew green jobs in solar and hydrogen and wind and geothermal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it troubles me that here we are, the country that defeated the most monumental threat of the 20th century in Nazi Germany and Japan, and we're now behind Germany and Japan in solar technologies. Of the top 10 wind companies on Earth, only one is American. Iceland, Denmark, now making great strides in geothermal and wind. We're not. Seven o ut of every 10 cars in Brazil are fuel flexible. We're not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can regain our capacities. We can regain our skills, we can regain our competitive edge in the world. We can regain our manufacturing strength in the world by leapfrogging ahead of them in renewable technologies. To do that, we've got to make investments in the American people, not the bottom line profits of oil companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we gave those oil companies the opportunity to make those investments in the American people, what did they do?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe that it's time to make those investments in the American people, in American jobs, in renewable energy. And by doing so, we can reduce our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have created a paradigm, Mr. Speaker, where, with a $9 trillion debt, we are borrowing money from China to fund our defense budgets to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to fuel our military to protect us from China and the Persian G ulf. It makes no sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, we have the opportunity to take a giant leap for common sense: reinvest in the American people, reinvest in American jobs, reinvest in our defense, reinvest in our competitive edge, reinvest in our human capital, reduce our dependence on foreign oil. And that's precisely what we will do by passing this bill.</paragraph>
