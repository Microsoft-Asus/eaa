  <narrative>IMPORTANT ENERGY POLICIES -- (House of Representatives - June 09, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5047]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412256" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as another week passes and gas prices continue to hit all-time record highs each day, our constituents want answers from Congress. Because there is no one single fix to stabilize the energy prices, we must have a comprehensive, realistic plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month I introduced House Resolution 1206 which promotes five important energy policies that I believe will assist Congress as we develop our comprehensive energy plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The five points within House Resolution 1206 include promotion and expansion of renewable alternative energy sources, increasing domestic refining capacity, promotion of conservation, increasing energy efficiency, expansion of research and development for domestic exploration, and enhancement of consumer education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Resolution 1206 is one piece of our energy puzzle, but an important one as Congress seeks to improve our Nation's comprehensive energy policy.</paragraph>
