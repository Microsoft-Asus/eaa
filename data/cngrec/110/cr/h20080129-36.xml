    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I announce to the House that Margaret Truman Daniel, the daughter of our 33rd President, Harry S. Truman, passed away today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the daughter of a Jackson County judge, a United States Senator from Missouri, a Vice President and President, Margaret Truman grew up in politics. She was a good friend, and I know others in this House who knew her considered her a friend as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Margaret was an accomplished woman in her own right, but she also revered her father's memory. In this very Chamber in 1984 a Joint Session of Congress was convened to honor the 100th anniversary of President Truman's birth. As chairman of that event, I worked with Margaret closely and was grateful for her participation as a speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also had the honor of being with Margaret on the first day that the Truman Home in Independence, Missouri, was opened to the public as a museum in the National Park Service system. I will never forget watching her sign the guest book in her own home that day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Margaret Truman Daniel was a great American and, as an independent-minded woman, was truly her father's daughter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know my colleagues join me in expressing this body's deepest condolences to the family of Margaret Truman Daniel, including her three surviving sons, Clifton, Harrison, and Thomas.</paragraph>
