    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this year National Save for Retirement Week is going to take place October 21st through the 27th. National Save for Retirement Week is the first congressionally endorsed, formal event publicly urging employers to promote the benefits of saving for retirement, and encourage their employees to take full advantage of employer-sponsored retirement and savings plans. Hopefully this week will make employees more aware of how critical it is to save now for their  financial future and learn how to take advantage of free money when saving for retirement by contributing enough to the retirement plan to receive the company match.</paragraph>
