  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="TRIBUTE TO ROY E. JUNE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize a distinguished and decorated World War II U.S. Army Air Corps veteran from my home State of Montana. Born in the small, humble town of Forsyth, 1LT Roy E. June comes as an inspiration to those who wish to lead a life of service to their country and their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the tragedy of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, came America's greatest generation responding to the certain urgency of that era. Like many young men of that generation, Roy and his buddies enlisted in the Armed Forces to defend their country and to advance the just cause of freedom. In the U.S. Army Air Corps, Roy's bravery and skills as a fighter pilot set him above the rest. As a P-51 Mustang fighter pilot, Roy escorted B-29 bombers to Japan, strafed and dive-bombed strategic military  installations on Chi Chi Jima. For his heroism in the Pacific Theater, Roy earned an Air Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster and the Distinguished Flying Cross. His 15th Fighter Group, the 47th Fighter Squadron was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A fellow returning from Hawaii brought news about the end of the war. "Atomic Bomb Dropped On Japan" read the headline of the Honolulu Daily Advertiser. After 11 missions over Japan and more than 500 combat hours in the P-51s, Roy returned home to Missoula in January 1946.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having grown up in the great State of Montana, Roy could recall many fond memories from his youth in his hometown of Forsyth. Roy was a Boy Scout and played center on the high school football team. Summers meant Huck Finn adventures and odd jobs; winters, though harsh, saw skating parties on the Yellowstone and ice hockey using sticks and tin cans. Before he joined the Air Corps, Roy studied engineering at the Montana State College in Bozeman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And like all Montanans who believe a good education is a lifelong process, Roy went back to school after his return from war. With degrees in journalism and business administration from the University of Montana in Missoula, Roy entered law school in 1949. There he met his wife Laura Jane Brautigam, also a native of Montana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Receiving his law degree in 1952, Roy went on to practice law in Helena where he helped to draft bills for State senators during the 1953 session. In Billings, he became an associate in the law firm of Sanders, Cresap and Koch representing groups such as the National Beef Council and the National Livestock Auction Markets. A few years later, Roy moved to California to serve as the city attorney for Costa Mesa. He took with him the spirit of Montana generosity and incorporated several nonprofit  companies pro bono as his contribution to his community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even after his retirement in December 1996, Roy continues to give back to his community by volunteering at the Palm Springs Air Museum. Armed with firsthand knowledge of World War II aviation and the conflicts in the Pacific Theater, Roy shares his vivid  experience with all, much to the delight of visitors, young and old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, 1LT Roy June is a testament to the Montana spirit. We believe in courage, sacrifice, and service. From Montana to the Japanese Islands of Iwo Jima and Chi Chi Jima, wherever Roy was, he put up his best for his community and more importantly, his country. My fellow Montanans and I are extremely proud of Roy and his contributions to our State and Nation. A son of Montana from America's greatest generation, Roy reminds all of us that commitment and service to this country never end.</paragraph>
