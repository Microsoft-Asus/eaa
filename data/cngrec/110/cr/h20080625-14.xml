  <narrative>BIG OIL DOESN'T NEED MORE LAND TO DRILL; THEY SHOULD USE IT OR LOSE IT -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6012]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, every day, American consumers are being squeezed at the pump. They can no longer afford for Congress to be divided on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge every Member of Congress to support legislation on the floor that would compel the oil industry to drill on the public lands it already controls. Big Oil would either have to produce from these lands, would have to show they are being diligent in their development or would have to give up the right to control even more Federal energy resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, we are telling Big Oil to either use it or lose it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Experts estimate that 68 million acres of leased land could produce 4.8 million barrels of oil, which would nearly double the Nation's total oil production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressional Republicans and President Bush are calling for domestic  drilling, saying it is the only solution to control high prices. Republicans should then be demanding that Big Oil drill on the 68 million acres where they already have leases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Americans have been deeply hurt by the prices at the pump. Republicans should join with the Democrats and should tell Big Oil companies to get to work now.</paragraph>
