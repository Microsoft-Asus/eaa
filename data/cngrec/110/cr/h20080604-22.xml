    <paragraph>As you see, the theme this morning is to talk about gasoline prices, and as we look at the various solutions that are available to our country, it's interesting to note how votes happen in this House. It's rare that a particular position is supported or opposed 100 percent by either party. But let me walk you through a couple of solutions that have been voted on in this House over the last 14 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Drilling in ANWR; 91 percent of Republicans supported it, 86 percent of Democrats opposed it. Coal-to-liquids; 97 percent of Republicans supported it, 78 percent of Democrats opposed it. Oil shale exploration; 90 percent Republican support, 86 percent Democrat opposition. Drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf, 81 percent of Republicans support it, 83 percent of Democrats oppose it. Increased refinery capacity; Republicans support that by 97 percent, Democrats oppose it by 96 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to begin to look rationally at the solutions that will help address America's need for energy, gasoline and electricity as we move forward.</paragraph>
