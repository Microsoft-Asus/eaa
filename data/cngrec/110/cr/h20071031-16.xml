  <narrative>DEMOCRATS EXERCISE FISCAL DISCIPLINE -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12243]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412198" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this summer the Democrat-led House completed work on all 12 appropriations bills that fund the Federal Government for the upcoming year. Each bill restores fiscal responsibility, ensures that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely, and was passed with bipartisan support. Our bills will not add money to the Federal deficit because we kept our promise to adhere to pay-as-you-go rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, financial watchdogs, including the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, the Concord Coalition and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget praised the new Congress for our strict adherence to the PAYGO rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Contrast that praise with the Bush administration's record of turning record surpluses into record deficits. President Bush has borrowed more money from foreign nations than all 42 of his predecessors combined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet the President threatens to veto our appropriations bills because he says they are excessive. Does he really oppose important investments in veterans health care, pay raises for active duty soldiers, funding for more cops on our streets, and funding for life-saving medical research?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans need to send a message to President Bush to get his priorities right.</paragraph>
