    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last Saturday I had the honor of attending a memorial service celebrating the life of Sergeant First Class George Walter Koon. Sergeant Koon was a soldier of the United States Army Infantry during the Korean War. He was a POW murdered while in captivity in 1951, but his body remained unrecovered for over half a century. It was not until recently that the hard work of his family and the Department of Defense helped positively identify Sergeant Koon and  return him from North Korea to his family in Leesville, South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The life and story of Sergeant Koon is an example of tremendous courage and commitment. His brother Reverend Carl Koon correctly stated that "freedom isn't cheap and it isn't free." His sacrifice and that of his fellow American soldiers will never be forgotten to liberate dozens of countries so that more people today live in free market democracy than ever in the history of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The memorial service was conducted by Reverend John McKeown and Reverend George A. Koon, nephew namesake of the deceased hero, at the Old Lexington Baptist Church of Leesville. He received full military honors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
