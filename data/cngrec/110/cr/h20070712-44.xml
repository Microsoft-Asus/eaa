    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great solemnity to mark the 1-year anniversary of the killing of three Israeli soldiers and the kidnapping of two others, Eldad Regev and Udi Goldwasser. On July 12, 2006, Hezbollah terrorists crossed into Israel and attacked two IDF armored jeeps as they were patrolling Israel's northern border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eldad is 26, born in Kiryat Motzkin. I met Eldad's brother, Benny, in Israel last summer, just weeks after his brother's kidnapping. He begged us to spread the message back to the United States that we must do everything possible to bring the missing soldiers home. Eldad's family and friends pray every day for Eldad's safety and his swift return. They wrote of him:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"One of the qualities that makes Eldad so special is the kindness of his heart, never hesitating to donate and offer aid to anyone in need. He always likes to stay informed and is constantly involved in everything that is happening around him."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Udi is 31 from Nahariya. I met Udi's mother just a few months ago when she visited Members of Congress on Capitol Hill. She came to raise awareness about the plight of her son and others who were kidnapped. Udi had just married Karnit when he was captured, and his wife had to spend their 1-year anniversary alone, wondering where her husband was and what condition he was in. His family and friends wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"He's a loving, caring person, always ready to offer a helping hand in any situation. He is a man of principles and values, knowledgeable in many varied subjects."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, Eldad and Udi are not alone among Israel's missing soldiers. Three weeks before their capture, Hamas kidnapped IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. The Shalit family has also met with many communities across the United States, urging people to remember their son and speak out on his behalf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise tonight to make sure that the plight of these soldiers is not forgotten. I rise to honor the sacrifices of these soldiers and their families who wait every day for news of their circumstances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here in my hand I have a copy of their dogtags. The United Jewish Communities around the country delivered a copy of the dogtags to every Member of Congress to help raise awareness that it has been 1 year since the families have heard from their loved ones. It has been 1 whole year since they have seen their husband, son, and brother. These families have heard not one word from the captors about whether they are alive or okay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join the families of these soldiers and all freedom-loving Americans in calling for the immediate and unconditional release of Eldad, Udi, and Gilad. America stands with Israel in its refusal to let these soldiers be forgotten. Let their dogtags on the floor of the United States House of Representatives serve as a symbol of unwavering vigilance and support. American families and Israeli families are united in the hope that these families should suffer no longer.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, one year ago today, Hezbollah militants executed a brazen cross-border attack on an Israeli patrol that killed three and kidnapped Israeli reservists Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. Weeks before, on June 25, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel from Gaza, killing two and abducting Corporal Gilad Shalit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to travel to the region with Speaker NANCY PELOSI. With each Arab leader our delegation pressed the plight of these soldiers. The Speaker personally handed their dog tags to Syrian President Assad and urged him to act on a humanitarian basis to achieve their swift and unconditional return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, these three brave soldiers join a longer list of MIAs that includes Zachary Baumel, Yehuda Katz, Zvi Feldman, taken hostage in 1982, and Ron Arad, an Israeli military pilot taken captive in 1986. As long as they are missing, their families, the people of Israel, and supporters of Israel around the world hold a constant vigil praying for their return. I want to recognize the dedicated work of the United Jewish Communities, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, and a multitude of synagogues,  camps and schools around the  country for their efforts to make sure these soldiers are not forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Leave no soldier behind," is the mantra of many armies. In a nation as small as Israel, where military service is mandatory, the commitment to rescue POWs and MIAs is a national imperative. It is our responsibility as a fellow democracy and steadfast ally to do all we can to help win their freedom.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to call the House's attention to a very sad anniversary. One year ago today, Hezbollah terrorists crossed into Israel to attack Israeli troops patrolling the Israeli side of the border with Lebanon. They killed three Israeli soldiers, wounded two others and kidnaped Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. Only a few days earlier, on June 25, 2006, Hamas terrorists likewise crossed into Israel and attacked an IDF position, killing two soldiers, wounding a third and kidnapping  Gildad Shalit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both of these vicious terrorist organizations, which constantly proclaim their adherence to religion and morality, have denied these three Israeli soldiers contact with the Red Cross or Red Crescent, or direct contact with their families. Despite the recent release of an audio tape, it is not in fact known if these three men are currently alive, if they are injured or if they are well. Not content merely to hold these men as hostages, Hamas and Hezbollah insist on torturing their families with  the agony of not knowing about the true condition of their loved ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is true measure of the faith and morality of these terrorists. In the name of religion they inflict agony. In the name of the sacred they perpetrate barbarism. In the name of their faith they degrade other human beings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus they show the true content of their beliefs. Thus they show the world what their vainglorious proclamations amount to: cynical cruelty and cold calculation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These terrorist groups have sought to transform Gilad, Ehud and Eldad into something they are not: bargaining chips or pawns, a kind of political chattel. Things that can be swapped for favors or sacrificed on a whim. These three men are not things. They are human beings. They have names and they have families. They have rights as captured soldiers and they have rights as human beings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House has expressed itself clearly on this matter on March 13th, when it passed <bill type="hr" number="107">H. Res. 107</bill>, the bipartisan resolution I introduced demanding the release of these three captives and condemning both the terrorists and their Syrian and Iranian sponsors for their criminal and indecent behavior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can not compel Hamas and Hezbollah to release Gilad, Ehud and Eldad any more than we can force them to understand the difference between right and wrong. You can not disgrace someone incapable of shame. But we can stand by our ally, the State of Israel. We can express our sympathy and our concern for the captives and for their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can let the perpetrators of this barbarism know that we have not forgotten what they have done, and what they are continuing to do. We can bear witness. And we can add our voices to all those saying "Enough. Enough. Let these men go home."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I call for the unconditional release of Israeli soldiers still held hostage by terrorists. Exactly one year ago today, Hezbollah terrorists entered territory that unambiguously belongs to Israel under international law, launching an assault into Israel's north that killed three soldiers on patrol, wounded two, and took two others hostage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The two hostages, Ehud "Udi" Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, were injured in the attack, and yet Hezbollah refuses to allow representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit them, a flagrant breach of international law and practice. They have also refused to give the hostages' families any indication that their loved ones are alive. This is particularly worrisome, because reports have surfaced suggesting Goldwasser and Regev could have been critically injured in the attack  in which they were taken captive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only seventeen days earlier, fundamentalist thugs launched a similar raid out of the Gaza Strip to take hostage another young Israeli soldier on patrol in Israel's south, Corporal Gilad Shalit. He has now been held hostage in Gaza for more than a year. Just two weeks ago a recording of him pleading for help was released on a Hamas website. In this recording, Shalit says that his health is deteriorating and he is in pressing need of long-term hospitalization. It should come as no surprise that  his terrorist captors have failed to allow him adequate medical treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Hezbollah and Hamas are clearly to blame for the outbreak of violence in the Middle East last summer. They committed acts of war by kidnapping Israeli soldiers who were conducting regular patrol missions on their own side of the border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while last summer's war has receded somewhat into the past, the initial causes for the violence have not yet been addressed. Chief among these is the fact that these three Israeli hostages remain in captivity and that Hezbollah and Hamas remain committed to Israel's violent destruction. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which imposed a ceasefire on Israel's Lebanon front, emphasized, and I quote, "the need to address the causes that have given rise to the current crisis, including  the unconditional release of the abducted Israeli soldiers." Unfortunately, that condition remains totally unfulfilled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this House has not been silent on the plight of these victims of terrorism. Shortly after Udi Goldwasser's young wife visited Congress at the start of this year and pleaded for our help, we swiftly passed <bill type="hr" number="107">H. Res. 107</bill>, which was sponsored by my good friend Congressman GARY ACKERMAN, the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia. This bill called for the unconditional release of the three kidnapped soldiers and condemned the  culpable terrorist groups for their despicable actions. The Senate passed a similar bill, which was introduced by Senator HILLARY CLINTON.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Speaker PELOSI has played a particularly admirable role in the global effort to free these three men. When she met with Syrian President Assad in Damascus just this past April, she presented him with a replica of the three hostages' "dog tags" as a means of urging him to secure their release from these terrorist groups that Damascus has long hosted and supported. She also made crystal-clear to President Assad that under no circumstances could bilateral relations with the United States  improve until Damascus showed its willingness to cease sponsoring terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To commemorate the one year anniversary of the kidnapping of Goldwasser and Regev by Hezbollah, the United Jewish Communities recently organized a campaign to send copies of these dog tags to every member of Congress. I commend them for their admirable and thoughtful activism drawing attention to the ongoing plight of the three captives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Israel is a steadfast ally of the United States, and it is on the frontline of the war against terrorism. Israeli soldiers face such threats every day, much like our own inspiring and steadfast soldiers who are currently serving in harm's way in places like Afghanistan and Iraq. It is incumbent upon us to give our ally in this fight our steadfast support in the face of such terrorist predations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, many of us have been active in efforts over the years to convince our friends in the EU to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist group. A very few EU states do so on a national basis, but the EU collectively continues to view Hezbollah strictly as a political party. This is an absurd anomaly, and I urge our EU friends and allies to reconsider this policy on this sad one-year anniversary. I know of no other "political party" in the world that kidnaps and holds hostages--a fairly remarkable  innovation in democratic politics. (In contrast to its policy regarding Hezbollah, the EU does designate Hamas as a terrorist group. I am pleased by that, but the distinction between Hamas killers and Hezbollah killers is frankly lost on me.)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have the following message for the terrorists who are holding the three Israeli soldiers: Release these innocent hostages, and do so without delay. Should you not, the civilized world--and certainly this body--will not remain silent.</paragraph>
