  <narrative>REMARKS OF CONGRESSMAN STEVE KING REGARDING SENATOR BARACK OBAMA -- (House of Representatives - March 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1433]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to strongly condemn the remarks made about U.S. Senator and Democratic Presidential Candidate BARACK OBAMA by Congressman Steve King of Iowa, who said that if Barack Obama became President, al Qaeda terrorists would, and I quote, "be dancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on September 11." Why? Because, he said, "of his middle name and because of who his father was."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Obama, like all of us in this House, swore on the Bible to defend our country from all enemies, foreign and domestic. He has done nothing to warrant this attack. He has served his country honorably in the U.S. Senate. This attack on his patriotism, religion, heritage, and middle name amount to nothing more than a smear campaign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would fully expect these comments to come from people like Rush Limbaugh or Ann Coulter, not from one of my House colleagues. There is simply no room in this country for remarks like these, remarks that Mr. King declares he stands by.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in condemning these hateful remarks.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
