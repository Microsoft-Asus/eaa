  <speaking speaker="400285" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it has been a few short weeks since the tragedies of Virginia Tech, which we cannot forget. Nor should we forget the fact that there are three suicides each day on college campuses and each year hundreds of thousands of acts of violence, many committed by those who have serious mental illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, passed into law in 1974, school personnel, administrators, and teachers who have little or no training in mental health are burdened with the task of defining and determining if a student is at risk. These educational personnel are also reluctant to release information for fear of legal action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I have introduced <bill type="h" number="2220">H.R. 2220</bill>, the Mental Health Security for America's Families in Education Act, to break down these barriers to allow our schools to communicate with parents after consultation with a licensed mental health professional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join the Association of American Universities, the American Council on Education, and the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges to help support this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
