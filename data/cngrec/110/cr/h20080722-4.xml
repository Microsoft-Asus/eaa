  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is my honor today to extend my congratulations to a dear constituent of my congressional district, Luis Diaz, upon his upcoming retirement as deputy director of Youth Co-Op.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has dedicated his life to the betterment of the youth of South Florida by ensuring that they learn the necessary skills to be able to compete and to be productive members of today's society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than three decades, Youth Co-Op has been a pioneer in assisting refugee children and young people in making the transition, sometimes difficult, into their new communities. Mr. Diaz' leadership and his dedication have been instrumental in helping maintain the vision of Youth Co-Op.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is also a distinguished journalist, producer and talk show host.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has been involved with the Miami-Dade Cultural Affairs Council as well as with the Spanish American League against Discrimination, among many other civic organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Luis Diaz' proudest role, however, Madam Speaker, is that of a husband and that of a father. His love and devotion to his wife, Xiomara, and to his three children mirror his commitment to our community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to not only call Luis Diaz a South Floridian but also my friend, all of South Florida's friend. Happy retirement, Mr. Diaz.</paragraph>
