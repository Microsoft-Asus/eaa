    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is my privilege to congratulate the High Rollers team of Cimarron-Memorial High School in Las Vegas. This team recently won a championship victory at the FIRST Robotics Competition at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FIRST Robotics Competition, otherwise known as the "Superbowl of Smarts," is designed to inspire young people to pursue opportunities in science and technology careers. The competition challenges teams of high school students and their mentors to construct robots over the course of 6 weeks while adhering to competition guidelines and design specifications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded in 1989 through the vision of inventor Dean Kamen, FIRST is a not-for-profit whose acronym means "For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology." As a result of Mr. Kamen's leadership, FIRST has grown into one of the leading robotics competitions in the entire country. Students from more than 1,300 high schools and 23 countries participated in this year's event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The High Rollers team from Cimarron paired with a coalition of two high school teams from South Windsor, CT, and Worcester, MA, to win the national championship title with a thrilling 59 to 54 victory in the final round. In honor of their victory, the students will meet with President Bush and attend a congressional reception where they will demonstrate their robots and share their achievements with Members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Cimarron team has a long tradition of success that is reflective of their hard work, dedication, and creativity as well as Cimarron-Memorial High School's strong commitment to academic excellence. They were among the top participants at the FIRST Las Vegas Regional held in March on the campus of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and were named the Las Vegas regional champions in 2005 and 2006. I know that every Member of the Senate joins me in honoring the extraordinary accomplishments  of Cimarron-Memorial High School and its FIRST Robotics National Championship team.</paragraph>
