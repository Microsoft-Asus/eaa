    <paragraph>Madam President, today I would like to recognize the Appalachian State University Mountaineers football team for pulling off one of the biggest upsets in college football history. To recognize this achievement, Senator BURR and I have introduced Senate resolution number <bill type="sr" number="309">S. Res. 309</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 1, 2007, the Appalachian State Mountaineers of the  NCAA Football Championship Subdivision, formerly known as Division 1-AA, beat the University of Michigan Wolverines, ranked fifth nationally, of the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision, formally known as Division 1-A, by a score of 34-32 in front of 109,000 spectators at "The Big House" in Ann Arbor, MI. No Division 1-AA team has ever been victorious over a nationally ranked Division 1-A opponent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The win over the Wolverines was an extraordinary team effort. Quarterback Armanti Edwards threw for 227 yards and three touchdowns while rushing for 62 yards and one touchdown. The receiving corps combined for 227 yards of offense with two touchdowns from Dexter Jackson and one from Hans Batichon. In addition, the defense had an outstanding game and forced two critical turnovers in the second half--one fumble recovery and one interception--to guide the Mountaineers to victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the fourth quarter the Mountaineers came up with the special plays needed to complete the monumental win. With Appalachian State trailing 32-31, Brian Quick blocked a Michigan field goal setting-up what would become the game-winning drive. On the ensuing drive, kicker Julian Rauch put a 24-yard field goal through the uprights to move the Mountaineers ahead 34-32 with 26 seconds left in the game. The Mountaineers, however, still needed one more big play from its special teams. With just  a few seconds remaining, Corey Lynch dramatically blocked a Wolverine field goal attempt to seal the victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the final gun, head coach Jerry Moore, who put together a masterful game plan, was carried off the field by his players in victory. The Appalachian State Mountaineers' victory over the Michigan Wolverines demonstrates that any achievement is possible with hard work and a great deal of heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the tremendous effort by the players, head coach Jerry Moore, and the assistant coaches and support personnel who all played critical roles in this historic victory. In addition, I would like to congratulate Dr. Kenneth E. Peacock, chancellor of Appalachian State University, Charles Cobb, athletic director, and all of the students and fans to whom this win meant so much.</paragraph>
