    <paragraph>Mr. President, we all know and understand that Americans are deeply concerned about the war in Iraq. We all represent the finest and bravest men and women across this great country who put themselves in harm's way to protect our very way of life. We all want our brave men and women who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan to come home as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of Georgia's military community have given mightily to our efforts in the Middle East. In fact, members of the 3rd Infantry Division, headquartered at Fort Stewart, GA, are heading to Iraq for the third time as we speak, and I wish to underscore how much we appreciate them and their families. These resolutions which the Democrats continue to put forth undermine these men and women. Any attempt to set a timeline for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, as the latest resolution does, will  embolden the enemy and tell them exactly how long they need to wait until they are free to take over and wreak havoc in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the desire to have the Iraqis take responsibility for their own country and step up to the plate in terms of taking the political, economic, and military actions necessary to secure Iraq, and I strongly support that goal. However, this resolution is the wrong way to accomplish it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These resolutions--and I believe there have been about 17 put forth over the course of the last couple of months--simply send the wrong message to our troops, and they send the wrong message to the enemy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Winston Churchill once said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nothing is more dangerous in wartime than to live in the temperamental atmosphere of a Gallup poll, always feeling one's pulse and taking one's temperature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that sums up what is going on here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These resolutions only serve to micromanage the war by a political body which simply is unable to do it effectively. We have a Commander in Chief who is entrusted with managing and leading our military during wartime, and the Commander in Chief's new plan for Iraq deserves a chance to succeed. These resolutions are designed to ensure that the President's plan fails, not that it succeeds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, these resolutions are completely contradictory to the Senate's support for GEN David Petraeus, our new commander of the multinational forces in Iraq. No Senator opposed General Petraeus's nomination. I have not heard anyone criticize him, and rightly so. We need to give General Petraeus and his counterinsurgency campaign in Iraq a chance to succeed. The people of Georgia, myself included, want General Petraeus to succeed. We understand the consequences of failure, and there is no question  the latest resolution we are considering in this body will not help him succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution advocates transitioning U.S. forces in Iraq to protecting U.S. coalition personnel, training and equipping Iraqi forces, and conducting counterterrorism operations, and calls for a diplomatic, political, and economic strategy to stabilize Iraq. Many people say the situation in Iraq requires a political and not a military solution. I strongly agree with that position; however, it is not possible to have a political solution or to make political progress if citizens live in  an unstable and unsafe society. Some level of order and stability must be in place before a political solution can take hold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In America, we take order and stability for granted because we live in a country that is extremely safe, secure, and stable. However, Iraq is not the United States. Iraqis do not live in a secure and stable society, and order and stability must be in place before there can be any hope for a long-term political solution. The additional troops we are sending are meant to create that order and stability, particularly in Baghdad. We need to give this effort a chance to succeed, and we need to create  stability and order before we can be hopeful about a long-term political solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Reid resolution opposes the President's plan without offering any concrete alternative. It opposes the mission which the Senate has unanimously confirmed General Petraeus to carry out, and it will not serve to help our troops and our commander in Iraq succeed in the mission we have sent them on to accomplish. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to point out some of the bitter ironies of this debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since roughly January, when the new majority took charge of this Congress, there have been numerous proposals with regard to how we should conduct ourselves in Iraq. I have tried to keep track of the various resolutions that have been proposed and, as my colleagues can see, there have been, according to my count, at least 17 resolutions. They start with the Biden and Levin resolutions, the Reid-Pelosi resolution, the Murtha resolution, the Biden-Levin resolution, the Conrad funding cut resolution,  a waiver plan, a timeline plan, the Feingold resolution, the Obama resolution, the Clinton resolution, the Dodd resolution, the Kennedy resolution, the Feinstein resolution, the Byrd resolution, the Kerry resolution, and then the latest, the Reid resolution we are on today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this current iteration before the Senate, it says: The President shall commence the phased redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this joint resolution, with the goal of redeploying by March 31, 2008, all U.S. combat forces from Iraq, except for a limited number that are essential for the following purposes: protecting U.S. and coalition personnel and infrastructures, training and equipping Iraqi forces, and conducting targeted counterterrorism  operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason I find this list of resolutions--and now with the culmination on March 15--somewhat ironic is we are beginning to see some of the signs of success of the new plan, the Baghdad security plan proposed by Prime Minister Maliki, with the support of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, in the Associated Press yesterday, Robert Reid wrote that bomb deaths have gone down 30 percent in Baghdad since the security crackdown that began a month ago and that execution-style slayings have been cut nearly in half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be printed in the Record following my remarks.</paragraph>
