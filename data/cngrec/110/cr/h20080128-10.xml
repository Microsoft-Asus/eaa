  <speaking speaker="400638" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tonight we expect to hear President Bush's last State of the Union address to this Congress. I hope that the recent days working together with this Congress on a bipartisan economic stimulus package can be a good model for the rest of this year and the rest of this President's term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want to extend a hand to work with him when we can, and this is a good example of how we can do it. But if we see continued roadblocks to progress in this country, we must work to break those roadblocks down and continue to work restoring fiscal responsibility in our government, changing course in Iraq, preparing to address global climate change, addressing the military readiness crisis in this country, and restoring America's moral leadership in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we can and we must continue to work together for the great needs of this country. I hope we can continue to do that for the rest of this session.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
