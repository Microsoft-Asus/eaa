  <narrative>LET'S DO GOD'S WORK ON EARTH -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H15322]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412236" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last night I voted with a great majority in this House and every one but one Republican on a resolution to recognize the benefits and honor of Christmas and the Christian religion. I read that resolution and agree that Christianity is a great religion, a lot to be learned from it, and the teachings of Jesus are wonderful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask my colleagues on the Republican side who voted for this, the Members of the Senate, and the President to remember those teachings and do God's work here on Earth: "There but for the grace of God go I," and "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President is supposed to be vetoing the CHIP bill today which would give health care to children. That's not in the spirit of St. Nick or, I believe, in the tradition of the Christian religion or the Judeo-Christian religions. Nor is it in that same spirit that we would take away from people that need help with college education, with health care, and with research for diseases, and for responsible fiscal policies and for taking care of God's Earth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask that we not just pass resolutions in name, but in spirit, and we honor the great religions and do God's work on Earth.</paragraph>
