  <narrative>IN SUPPORT OF SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11398]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. SESTAK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412232" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of the SCHIP bill, which will provide health insurance for 4 million uninsured children, expanded dental care, and, for the first time, treating mental disabilities and mental illness on a par with physical disability. The bill also contains premium assistance subsidies, so that at least 70 percent of these children's parents remain in employer-based private health insurance plans. But I rise most because of what I saw when my 4-year-old daughter  was given 3 to 9 months to live and we lived on a cancer ward in the city. And this Nation, because of my military service, gave me the best health care possible for her to have an opportunity, her roommate was a young 2 1/2 -year-old boy diagnosed with acute leukemia whose parents did not have health insurance and social workers had to discuss whether that boy would, with my daughter, have an opportunity to live into life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of this bill for that young boy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
