  <narrative>WEST VIRGINIA ANGELS IN ADOPTION -- (Senate - September 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="8274">S8274</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300084" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor the love and commitment exhibited by two of my fellow West Virginians, Jeff and Amy Dunford of Spanishburg, my 2008 nominees as West Virginia's Angels in Adoption. I have participated in this program by the Congressional Caucus on Adoption since its inception, and I am proud to talk about this year's West Virginia family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, Jeff and Amy made the wonderful decision to become foster parents. They, like many caring West Virginia families, opened up their home and created a loving environment for children in need of such a place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Dunfords started with a sibling group, and by the spring of 2005, the Dunfords have successfully adopted three children, all the while continuing to provide both a short-term and long-term home for additional foster children. In fact, it was not long after the adoption process was completed that another sibling group was placed in the Dunford home. These three boys, all under the age of 3, would also be adopted by the Dunfords.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Being a foster and adoptive family always has its challenges, as well as its unique rewards. Taking care of young children often means sleepless nights, unexpected emergency room visits, and countless parent-teacher conferences. They were also faced with situations unique to foster families, including biological parent visits and counseling sessions. Through it all, the Dunfords faced these challenges with love and determination and now six children have a permanent and loving home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the Dunford family consists of Jeff and Amy, Jeremy, Walter, Holly, Richard, Greg, and Christopher. Jeff and Amy continue to be active in the foster care system, providing assistance with recruitment and training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jeff and Amy are a testament to the wonderful men and women involved in foster care and adoption services. Throughout my Senate career and as a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I have worked hard in a bipartisan manner to expand and support adoptive and foster parents. Over the years, progress has been made, and since the 1997 Adoption and Safe Family Act which I fought for, adoptions for foster care have doubled--a true sign of success. But with over 100,000 children still  in foster care and waiting to be adopted, there is more to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, I am working with a bipartisan coalition to expand the adoption incentives program, improve adoption assistance and on programs enhancing foster care. As important as policy can be, the true heroes are the parents like the Dunfords, who have selflessly opened up their home to vulnerable children. I hope their story, and the stories of all this year's Angels in Adoption, will inspire my colleagues and families nationwide to promote adoption and other supports for vulnerable children.</paragraph>
