    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to draw my colleagues' attention to a report released today by a bipartisan panel of Asia specialists cochaired by Richard L. Armitage and Joseph Nye. The report, "The U.S.-Japan Alliance: Getting Asia Right Through 2020," highlights major trends in Asia and provides the panel's comprehensive analysis with security and economic policy recommendations, with specific reference to our bilateral relations with Japan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Senators will recall that Ambassador Armitage and Dr. Nye issued a report in October 2000 titled "The United States and Japan: Advancing Toward a Mature Partnership." This landmark document, which subsequently became known as the Armitage Report, aimed at strengthening the U.S.-Japan relationship in the areas of politics, security, Okinawa, intelligence, economics and diplomacy. This new report, which is already being called "Armitage II," continues to emphasize the importance of the  alliance but goes a step further, by addressing the ways in which the alliance can work to positively influence future affairs in Asia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report, which is available on the CSIS Web site at: http://www.csis.org/component/option,com--csis--pubs/task,view /id,3729/typ, is not a political document. It reflects the views of the study group members only. Nevertheless, it represents a serious attempt to outline a vision that would achieve a balance of power in Asia through 2020 that favors American interests and values and promotes regional stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage all Senators and their staffs to examine this serious and significant new report.</paragraph>
