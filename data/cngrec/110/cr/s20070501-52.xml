  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor my good friend Jack Valenti, who, passed away last week on April 26.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his life, Jack Valenti wore several hats, including that of a soldier, a devoted public servant, and a pioneer in the film industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack was born on September 5, 1921, in Houston, TX and was the grandson of Sicilian immigrants. At age 15, he became the youngest high school graduate in the history of the city of Houston and began a career as an office boy with Exxon Oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack served honorably in the Army Air Corps during World War II, flying in 51 separate combat missions as pilot of the B-25 attack bomber with the 12th Air Force in Italy. He obtained the rank of lieutenant and received multiple decorations, including the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal with four clusters, the Distinguished Unit Citation with one cluster, and the European Theater Ribbon with four battle stars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After serving in the war, Jack attended college at the University of Houston, doing all his undergraduate work at night as he worked during the day. He earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1946 and later became the University of Houston's first graduate ever to be admitted to Harvard Business School. He received an MBA from Harvard in 1948.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the intervening years, Jack held many positions in this town, but in 1966 Jack resigned from a top position in the White House to become only the third president of the Motion Picture Association of America, MPAA. He held this, his most famous position, for 38 years before retiring in 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As president of MPAA, Jack arbitrated one of the most famous developments the film industry has ever come out with--the voluntary rating system. The ratings "G," "PG," "PG-13" and "R" have become staples, not only in the movie-going practices of every American but also in our Nation's cultural consciousness. However, more important than the societal notions and the clich&#xE9;d images associated with these ratings is the real assistance that this system has provided to parents and families  in evaluating the appropriateness of various movies. Indeed, the MPAA rating system pioneered by Jack Valenti has become a prime example of the effectiveness of industry self-regulation without government intervention, and I am very grateful for Jack's work in this area even when many in his industry fought him along the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to pioneering the rating system, Jack Valenti also worked to advance the film industry into the 21st century. Indeed, during his tenure at the MPAA, he presided over unprecedented changes in the worldwide film industry, including the advancement of the digital era. I remember having several conversations with Jack as the film industry struggled to deal with the new challenges presented by digital distribution of their content. Together, Jack and I worked tirelessly to balance the  competing demands of consumer's rights and the protection of one of America's largest exports--entertainment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With Jack's help, we were able to refocus the Federal Government's resources to more effectively protect the creative genius of a great American industry--the film industry. We all know how blatantly some bad actors around the world pirate America's movies and rob the United States of jobs. Thanks to Jack's efforts, we have made great strides in this area and laid the groundwork to allow us to stamp out this criminal activity in the years ahead. Combating the theft and piracy of intellectual  property was a real passion for Jack, and I was privileged to work with him in this endeavor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, those of us who knew Jack Valenti personally will always remember him as a charitable man who was devoted to his family. While his influence on the film industry has been famous and unmistakable, many of us will remember him more for the personal friendship we shared with him. I will miss him greatly.</paragraph>
