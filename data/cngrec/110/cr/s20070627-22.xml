  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request that I would like to make, and I will do that right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 189, <bill type="h" number="1585">H.R. 1585</bill>, the Department of Defense Authorization Act, on Monday, July 9, following the period of morning business.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senate bill is not yet available. I think the bill will be filed at some point soon so that Members can review it, but at this time, until Members see the legislation, I will object, and maybe we can revisit this when the bill is reported. Therefore, I object.</paragraph>

  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>If I could ask the indulgence of the majority leader briefly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to the effort on the homeland security, 9/11 Commission recommendations, I think the concerns we have on this legislation were made very clear, laid out in the Congressional Record when the legislation was being considered. We want homeland security in America, but we also want to make sure the money we provide and what we authorize is done in a responsible and appropriate way. There is the possibility of gorging the system without getting a lot of results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have flown to the different ports in this country and looked at port security and all the intermodal activities and the security that goes on there. More is being done than maybe some people realize. But also there were some labor provisions in this legislation that clearly needed to be worked out in order for this legislation to make it through the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I agree, hopefully we can get something worked out here where this legislation could perhaps get into conference and get it done before we leave for the Fourth of July. The conferees know where the problems are; if they would meet and get those problems worked out, then I think probably this legislation could be cleared.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just wanted to respond to the majority leader's concern. I understand how he feels and what he is trying to do, but I did want to put those comments and those thoughts on the record.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would say this: The labor provisions about which the distinguished Senator talked, we have agreed to take care of those. Everybody knows that. Maybe my friend doesn't, but we certainly have conveyed this to the minority in great detail. I would simply say, if it is not this, then what is it? We have agreed to handle the labor situation in this bill. The Speaker and I have agreed, and I don't know what other assurance anyone could give.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is really stunning to me, that on the Defense authorization bill I am  going to have to file cloture--Defense authorization bill--a motion to proceed to it. We have already filed--I don't know the exact number, I lose track of it, but 12 to 14 motions, clotures on motions to proceed, far more than were done in the last Congress just in this little period of time we have been here. Why? Because everything we move to, there is an objection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Keep in mind what this is. It is the Defense authorization bill, a bill we have to pass to take care of our troops in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Korea, in Germany, and troops here at home. It is for training. It has a pay raise in it. It is a good piece of legislation worked on by Senator Warner and Senator Levin. It is a bipartisan bill, and I just think everyone who is listening to these proceedings, wherever they might be, should understand the Republicans are objecting to  going to the bill to fund our troops.</paragraph>
