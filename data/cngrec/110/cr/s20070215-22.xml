    <paragraph>Madam President, Saint Luke explains in his Gospel:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath sent me to heal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Delivering care to the sick and injured is the Lord's work. To heal the sick at great risk to one's own safety reflects the best that we can be as the Lord's servants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am here to honor three healers from my home State of Montana--ambulance pilot Vince Kirol, paramedic and firefighter Paul Erikson, and registered nurse Darcy Doyle. These Montana heroes died tragically during an air rescue mission on February 6.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their deaths are a tremendous loss to their families, to Benefits Healthcare, and to all of Montana. These dedicated individuals were en route to Bozeman from Great Falls in dangerous weather to pick up a patient who had suffered a severe head injury that required immediate surgery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every minute counted. The victim's injury had to be treated as quickly as possible. The longer it took to get him to the hospital, the worse his chances were for survival. The only way to get the patient the care he needed was by air transport. So the dependable air ambulance team at Benefits Healthcare was called. Vince, Paul, and Darcy responded to the call without hesitation and without concern for their own safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They knew that somebody's life was hanging in the balance. This is the type of pressure-filled situation in which they have always operated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Montana is a large State, it is a beautiful State, with rural and isolated areas, where people who are injured may need immediate rescue, may need it right away, including air ambulance transportation to a trauma center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, there are not enough hospitals in Montana that can give the kind of care someone with severe injuries immediately needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So-called level 1 hospitals have operating rooms, surgeons, and radiologists available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, waiting and ready for any patient with severe injuries who is brought in. There are no level 1 hospitals in Montana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Level 2 hospitals have the right facilities, but the doctors are not in the hospital around the clock to be available immediately when a patient arrives. There are only three level 2 trauma centers in Montana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very expensive to run hospitals and offer this high-level, specialized care. Only three hospitals in Montana--one in Missoula, one in Billings, and one in Great Falls--offer such services, so every patient who needs a trauma center has to go to one of these hospitals. This makes air ambulance transportation even more important, given Montana's 800-mile span and mountainous terrain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Benefits medevac program provides 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week air ambulance transportation in Montana and the Northwest. Aircraft respond to isolated areas, accident scenes, and hospitals to bring patients to the regional emergency center as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These dedicated pilots, nurses, and paramedics who operate the Benefits medevac program provide honorable and essential services to Montana. The three Benefits professionals who lost their lives last week were trying to do just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Darcy Dengel was a 27-year-old registered nurse. She joined Benefits in June 2001 and transferred to the emergency room in August 2003, where she also worked as a flight nurse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her Benefits colleagues describe her as a bright, talented, and vibrant woman who loved her work because that work gave her a unique opportunity to help people in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was able to make a difficult time for a patient a little easier with her gentle care. She was to be married this spring to Rob Beal and is survived by parents Rich and Donna Dengel of Lewistown, MT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A long-time friend of Darcy Dengel's family described Darcy this way:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was a light ..... She didn't worry about danger in her work as a flight nurse. She wanted to help people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Erickson was 33 years old and was the medic on the flight. Paul was a firefighter who worked on the Mercy Flight on his days off. He worked side by side with his wife Rachelle, who is the trauma coordinator for Benefits. They had a baby boy last July named Spencer Pilot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Assistant fire chief Steve Hester said this of his colleague:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul considered it a service to the community. He was all about service to others. He knew that in rural Montana the only way you can get help sometimes is by air.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vince Kirol was 58 years old and had been flying for 40 years. He was a Mercy Flight fixed-wing pilot for 13 years after working for Metro Aviation in Shreveport, LA. He is survived by his wife Diana and two sons. Vince's pastor noted that he loved the mountains and he loved skiing and hiking with his sons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Billy Darnell, a friend of Vince's from his church, said this about him:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He cared about people. That's why he loved his job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Darcy, Paul, and Vince selflessly put their lives at risk, transporting critically ill patients even in perilous weather conditions. They gave their own lives trying to save others. Their deaths are a tremendous loss to Montana. They were good servants, and they are heroes. Our hearts and our prayers go out to their families and to their friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
