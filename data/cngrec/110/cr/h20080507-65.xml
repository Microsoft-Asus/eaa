  <narrative>LET MEMBERS HAVE INPUT IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H3182]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express to the House my concern about the fact that Chairman Obey and Speaker Pelosi are very, very busy these days. If news reports are to be believed, it's apparent that they're going about doing all of the work of the Appropriations Committee as well as the House almost all alone with almost no input from Democrats or Republicans from the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of that busy schedule, I have been writing to Mr. Obey of late. I have sent him three letters altogether. Last Thursday, I sent him a letter that was signed by the entire Republican membership of the Appropriations Committee urging him to have regular order and full hearings on the supplemental that is before us that represents a huge portion of our spending, and yet there has been no hearing whatsoever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just in case Mr. Obey hasn't seen this letter because his staff is very busy, I know, working on these projects, I would like to submit that letter for the Record and urge the House to urge the leadership to allow us to have public hearings so that Members can have input regarding their districts' needs on this very, very important part of this year's work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, May 1, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: In the absence of any response from you to my April 21st and April 24th letters, and recognizing Senator Byrd's immediate response to the Republican Senators from his Committee, we are writing to once again express our grave concerns over media reports that your leadership plans to unilaterally, and without Member input, write and take to the House floor the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill under a closed rule and bypass full Appropriations Committee consideration.  Such action would be an historical and unprecedented abdication of responsibility for the House Appropriations Committee and would be viewed by many in both parties as a shameful power grab by House and Senate leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Byrd, who recognizes the slippery slope involved in circumventing the well-established rules and precedents of the Appropriations Committee, has scheduled a frill Senate Appropriations Committee markup for the week of May 5th. We urge you in the strongest possible terms to follow Senator Byrd's example and schedule a full Committee markup in the House at the earliest possible date.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is only right and fair that you allow Members of our Committee--Republicans and Democrats--to do the work they were elected to do. We are extremely troubled by the fact that under this scheme no Member of the House will be afforded the opportunity to offer amendments in full Committee or on the House floor while Senators in the other body will be given the opportunity to let their constituent's voices be heard. We must act expeditiously to move through full Committee and onto the floor a clean  Emergency Supplemental, free of extraneous funding and policy provisions, to address the urgent needs of our troops and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On October 20, 2006 then Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wrote in a letter to then-Speaker Hastert: "We must restore bipartisanship to the administration of the House, reestablish regular order for considering legislation. and ensure the rights of the minority, whichever party is in the minority. The voice of every American has a right to be heard."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, we urge you and Speaker Pelosi to stand by those words. Historical precedent and tradition dictates that this legislation be fashioned in an open and transparent process, and ensure full participation by both parties--not behind closed doors but in the full light of day. As the Speaker stated less than two years ago, every Member of the Appropriations Committee and, indeed, every Member of the House and their constituents deserve to have their voices heard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We look forward to your timely response.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
  </speaking>
