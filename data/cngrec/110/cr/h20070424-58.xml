    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, we spent quite a bit of time on the last bill talking about "Rising above the Gathering Storm," the report. It charts a course for continuing American prosperity in the decades to  come. I recommend that my colleagues heed the warning of this report and pursue policies to implement its four major policy recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of those recommendations is to "sustain and strengthen the Nation's traditional commitment to long-term basic research that has the potential to be transformational, to maintain the flow of new ideas that fuel the economy and provide security and enhance the quality of life." The Gathering Storm report goes on to propose specific high-priority action items to realize this recommendation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this bill, <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>, we have identified several of these action items that have broad bipartisan support. We call the bill the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Hall from Texas, ranking minority member of the Committee on Science and Technology, who helped craft the current version of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six weeks ago, the committee voted unanimously to favorably report this bill. We have heard from such groups as The Business Roundtable and the Council of Competitiveness expressing their support for the bill. These organizations represent a broad spectrum of business interests, understand that new technology ideas are necessary for the U.S. prosperity in a global 21st century economy. In fact, some economists have estimated that half of the economic growth in the United States since World War  II can be attributed to technological innovation. <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> is needed to prevent the United States from falling behind other nations whose national commitments to research are increasing, just as ours have been decreasing. The fear is not just about falling behind scientifically, it's about falling behind economically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first two provisions of <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> focus on support for early-career scientists and engineers through grant programs at the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. These grants will identify and support our best and brightest young researchers who are engaged in high-risk, high-reward research that is transformational or highly innovative. By focusing on young researchers, we promote new ideas and research on the frontiers of knowledge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also supports graduate student training grants for individuals interested in research areas relative to industry's technological needs, establishes a Presidential Award for Innovation, creates a planning mechanism for maintaining the Nation's major research facilities, authorizes the National Science Foundation to support research on innovation, directs reports on Federal efforts to recruit new scientists and engineers, identifies NASA as a key player in the national competitiveness  policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill doesn't merely seek to fund all of science, it focuses on fostering the most innovative elements of a scientific enterprise. It is through research such as these that we lay a foundation for future of global economic competitiveness. In the future, a healthy scientific and technological enterprise spawns innovation, creating jobs that pay good wages and produces products that make our lives better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We must pave the way to that future, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400165" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support what is essentially the second piece of the Science Committee's innovation and competitiveness agenda package. I am pleased that this Congress continues to advance the innovation agenda that the President laid out 2 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Primarily, this bill enhances the Faculty Early Career Development Program at NSF to help researchers establish a lab and pursue risky research in emerging fields. It establishes a similar program at the Department of Energy. It also ensures that funding increases proportionately to the overall NSF budget for the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship, which supports graduate students in cutting-edge interdisciplinary fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, most of this bill was part of a Republican-led effort in the last Congress to incorporate many of the suggestions and various innovation and competitiveness reports without necessarily reinventing the wheel to do so. While <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> is similar to what we did last year, it does have some additions that were never vetted at the committee level, and I have some concern with that process. I hope as we continue the reauthorization process for NSF, the chairman will work with me, as he always  has and as he does, and we can thoughtfully pass good legislation as we move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With specific regard to <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>, I do thank the chairman for working with us to restore a few of the provisions that had been previously accepted by the committee, particularly in NIST report language and a sense of the Congress that NASA also has a role to play in United States innovation and competitiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important, Mr. Chairman, that our Nation continue to lead the world in technological innovation. To that end, we should support legislation that advances basic science research at the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. Research conducted by these young scholars will yield countless advantages. Americans understand that if we are to become energy independent, we will need solutions that promote clean, affordable and reliable American energy resources. That is why we  introduced the competitiveness agenda last year and that is why I continue to support this initiative. America's solutions for the future begin today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good bill. I thank the chairman for helping make it a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412188" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you Ranking Member Hall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my support for <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>, the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Act. In 2005, a bipartisan group of congressional legislators came together and asked the National Academies for a list of the top 10 action items that policymakers must take in order to assure that America stays globally competitive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their report, which was reduced, called "Rising Above the Gathering Storm," found that the U.S. would stand to lose our global competitiveness if we did not act immediately. One of their recommendations was to invest in research in an effort to "sustain and strengthen the Nation's traditional commitment to long-term basic research that has the potential to be transformational to maintain the flow of new ideas that fuel the economy, provide security, and enhance the quality of life." This  bill does exactly that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation provides early-career awards for scientists and engineers at the National Science Foundation and at the Department of Energy. Young researchers and scientists can shift paradigms, break out of traditions, and think of new ideas within their field; and it is this outside-of-the-box thinking that we must promote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The early-career awards in this bill awards young scientists for engaging in both high-risk, but also high-reward, research that is transformational and innovative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does not fund all science. This bill focuses on fostering the most innovative of elements in the scientific enterprise. With countries such as India and China becoming more and more competitive, we have to take every action possible to ensure that the United States of America stays globally competitive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for bringing this bill forward. I am honored to be a sponsor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I do rise today in strong support of  <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>, the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation, just like <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> which we just passed, is a fantastic opportunity for bipartisanship to support math and science education in this country. Taken in combination with that bill, 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds, we lay a crucial foundation in maintaining America's competitiveness worldwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Academies released a report entitled "Rising Above the Gathering Storm." It looked at ways in which the Federal Government could enhance our country's science and technology enterprise so we can continue to compete and prosper in this global marketplace. In addition to its recommendations with respect to K-12 education, the commission came to the conclusion that there is a general lack of research in science and engineering in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our country must face the reality that China and India are making significant strides and pouring major resources into science and engineering. Therefore, in order to stay competitive, we need to not only encourage young students to get excited by the possibilities that exist with technology advances, but we also need to support young scientist research. Since younger scientists are more likely to do innovative and transformative work, it is in our country's best interest to ensure that these  young scientists indeed have the support that they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Act offers rewards for younger students in order to encourage them to continue their work in the fields of science and engineering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also strengthens Federal support for science and engineering researchers at the early stages of their career by expanding the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship program at NSF, establishing a Presidential Innovation Award, and authorizing NSF to authorize research on innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to emphasize that I truly believe in order for our great Nation to remain competitive in the ever-advancing global marketplace, we need to sustain and strengthen our commitment to long-term basic research. This is research that has the potential to be transformational in maintaining the flow of new ideas that fuel our economy, provide security and enhance the quality of life for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I firmly believe this legislation is a great first step to address this impending crisis, both in America's workforce and our country's research institutions, and I am proud to support the bill, and I ask all of my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, before I conclude, and hopefully I will not run out of time, but I did want to at this point say that as much as I am for this bill, I have to oppose one of the amendments that is going to be offered by the gentlelady from New York, Mrs. Gillibrand, the Gillibrand amendment. It is duplicative. We already do that under the Department of Education in regard to providing scholarships, merit scholarships for advanced students in our high schools. We already do that through  the Department of Education, and it is a very well-funded program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But more importantly, Mr. Chairman, the reason I am opposed to the amendment, in a way it contradicts what we just did in <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, where we said we will give these grants to these students to encourage them to study and pursue math and science and engineering types of advanced degrees in college with a payback, a two-for-one payback if they go into the teaching profession in a community where we have that great need for outstanding math and science teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Chairman, again, I support the bill. I am opposed to the Gillibrand amendment for the reasons outlined.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400155" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me thank my friend, Dr. Gingrey, for his support for this good bipartisan bill, and I yield 2 minutes to another active member of our committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412189" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong bipartisan support of <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>, Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research. Before my election to Congress, I spent my entire academic and professional career as a scientist, as a mathematician and an engineer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was particularly concerned when I read the sobering conclusions of the National Academies' "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" about America's declining competitiveness in a science and technology-based global economy. The report calls for an immediate action to maintain America's competitive advantage, and I agree with those recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are already moving forward to carry out some of the report's recommendations in an effort to renew interest in scientific development. <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> will provide grants to support young researchers in the early stages of their careers to engage in the high-risk, high-reward innovative research that challenges existing assumptions. The bill also establishes a Presidential Innovation Award to stimulate scientific and engineering advances in the public interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Nation, we face many daunting and almost overwhelming challenges, the solutions to which will require serious and dedicated scientific research. Conclusive research can take years, so we must work now to inspire today's students and researchers to take up such scientific pursuits. This bill provides just the right kind of specific incentives to compel young researchers to do the kind of pioneering and groundbreaking research that will yield dividends for the public interest.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400654" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support this bill and thank Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall, a fellow Texan, for their hard work and leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we can all agree on the importance of ensuring America is competitive in science and engineering. As the National Academy of Sciences report "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" warned, this country is in danger of losing its leadership role in these fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year I sponsored the Research For Competitiveness Act to address this issue. Unfortunately, that legislation did not come to the floor of the House after being passed by the Science Committee. However, I am pleased in this Congress in a bipartisan fashion to note that <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> incorporates sections from last year's bill that establish early-career grants for young scientists and engineers. These grants will encourage scientists and engineers in the early stages of their academic careers  to establish innovative lines of research. This approach continues the successful model of partnership between the Federal Government and America's universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, many of the technologies we enjoy today, such as breakthroughs that enabled e-commerce to become a reality in the 1990s, are based on research initially conducted at universities like the University of Texas in my hometown of Austin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we fund programs such as these, we are investing in minds and helping create the next generation of America's high-tech workforce. Therefore, I strongly support this legislation and urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400155" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. McCaul for his support for this good bipartisan bill, and I yield 3 minutes to another Texan (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), who is an active member of the Science and Technology Committee.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, thank you for our committee leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>, the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research Act. This legislation was based on policy recommendations from the "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" report to Congress by the National Academy of Sciences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the greatest challenges new researchers face is getting grant funding for their research. In Dallas, the University of Texas Southwest Medical School has four Nobel laureates, where they earned them right there, and UT-Dallas has at least one. Baylor University and others are stellar research institutions, and they compete at the national level for grants and perform award-winning scientific research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>These universities depend on Federal research funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When new faculty are hired at research universities in Texas and elsewhere, they are expected to be able to write grant proposals and successfully win funding from Federal agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to NIH, the average age at which the investigator first obtains RO1 major grant funding is age 42. If students are earning Ph.D.s in their late twenties, that means there are many years of struggle before they can establish themselves and eventually become full professors at these universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, many scientists have dropped out of science. It is too hard to get funding. The stress level is too high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, grant support targeted at new investigators is an important step toward resolving this problem. If Congress would fund Federal research as vigorously as our competitors overseas are doing, we wouldn't have such a problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> targets young investigator grant support at the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and other scientific research agencies under the purview of the Committee on Science and technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good bill and I encourage my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400165" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise with pleasure to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Science Foundation for years has been one of the primary sources of research funding for outstanding research in this Nation. In addition, the Department of Energy Office of Science has been a leader in certain areas, particularly high energy or particle physics, but also in a number of other physics areas, including the high energy light sources such as we have at Berkeley and a few other labs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support these programs, but a difficulty that has developed over the past few years is that we have some early career researchers, some young people just entering the field, and they really have difficulty obtaining funding because the tendency of the reviewers at the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy Office of Science is to say well, we have this group of very well-known good researchers. We know their backgrounds and we know they can produce and how well they  can do; we should just give them the money because we don't know for sure about the early researchers. Now, I don't think they actually say that, but, unfortunately, I think it is in the back of the minds of the peer review folks as they consider proposals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I experienced this personally with my son, who as a young scientist had trouble breaking into the field and had a number of proposals denied before he finally received funding. Even though he had made some national strides and was well-known in the field, yet it was difficult to get the funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These programs will be very, very helpful to support the early career researchers. But there is another aspect about which we need some new thinking and some change, and that is the fact that more and more science is becoming interdisciplinary, where you may have biology and physics, or biophysics; and you have relationships between biology and chemistry or chemistry and physics. You can go on and on. There are all sorts of different variations. Sometimes you may need five or six different disciplines  represented in the research program to really cover all of the aspects of the research. When you submit a proposal, usually you are required to specify one field and if you specify interdisciplinary, sometimes the other fields are not adequately represented on the peer review panel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I admit these are perhaps exceptions; but, nevertheless, we have to make sure that all of these bright young scientists or those wishing to branch out into another discipline, for example, having a very good background in physics and deciding they can really do some good work in biophysics. So we need to take account of that, and this bill will provide that within both the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support this bill. I believe both agencies, I know NSF supports it, and I am sure that the Department of Energy Office of Science also supports this bill because they have also noted the need for these changes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend and chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good day for science and research, and that means it is a good day for the United States of America and for our economic prosperity and for our children's future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Chair of the Research and Science Subcommittee, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>, the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Act, and I want to commend Chairman Gordon for his strong leadership on this bill that we are considering now, and on the one that passed earlier today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I share Chairman Gordon's absolute commitment and belief that we must take bold steps now to ensure that American students and workers are prepared for the careers of the future and so our Nation is equipped to compete in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To accomplish this, however, we must make sure our young scientists receive the support they need. That is why, as many of our prior speakers have pointed out, it is critically important to invest in the minds of young researchers now, because not only are they highly productive, but one day they will fill the ranks of our senior established and groundbreaking scientists on which our country's economy, competitiveness, and indeed our national security depend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am so pleased we are considering <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> today. The bill will ensure continued innovation by supporting outstanding researchers in early career stages, and ensuring that graduate students in research fields of particular importance to our future competitiveness receive adequate funding. I also share Ranking Member Ehlers' commitment to the importance of interdisciplinary scientific studies which he so well articulated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill and the one before it that we considered already and passed today, are critically important to the future prosperity of our country. I share Chairman Gordon's commitment to them, and I urge passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also would like to take this opportunity briefly to express support for the amendment soon to be offered by Mrs. Gillibrand of New York. Her amendment will require the National Science Foundation to institute a program to award scholarships in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics to undergraduate scholars. As a former teacher of undergraduate scholars and researchers, I know how important this stage is to career development and I support her commitment to it, applaud her  offering the amendment. I urge passage of that, as well as final passage of the bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Science Committee, as well as the ranking member. We have had a long and I like to think of it as a productive relationship, and it is an honor to come and acknowledge that we are finally listening to the voices of the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to hold up this document that claims the 110th Congress is a Congress that will move the innovation agenda. As a former member of the Science Committee I remember, as the century turned in 2000, listening to CEOs who indicated the crisis in both teaching, understanding and creative in math, science and technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me rise and belatedly say I have certainly supported the last legislative initiative dealing with 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds that we just passed, and I am delighted to be able to support the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research Act of 2007 and to say this: Science is in fact the work of the 21st century, but we are falling behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't need to hear the statistics again of how many engineers China graduates, for example, compared to the United States. This workforce cannot be prepared for the 21st century without actual investment by this country, and understanding that without researchers and scientists and engineers, we do not create work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, even though these might be considered passe and simple, but the light bulb, the typewriter, the car, all innovative aspects of our work, the airplane, created eons and years and decades of work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation in particular provides an opportunity for research, and the amendment provides an opportunity for research for undergraduate scholars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At Texas Southern University, we have a transportation study program. It has a pharmacy school, all small aspects of science. It has a solar energy project that I was proud to take Members of Congress to in 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are budding opportunities all over America, but what must we do to ensure that it works? We have to invest and provide the resources. We have to encourage not only students, but teachers, and then researchers that their work is valued. NASA and our move to the moon all concentrate on having those who will be researchers, technologists, readers of software, and yes, we hope, astronauts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud this legislation for what it does for engineers and scientists and physicians who are pioneers of the work of the 20th century and now can be pioneers of the work of the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that we have a step further to go. We need geologists. As we look at global warming, we must find ways to be efficient in the securing of energy, balancing what we call the resources of the ground as well as nuclear as well as solar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this is an outstanding bill, and I ask my colleagues to support it. I thank the distinguished chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>, the "Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research Act," of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. This bill is the second component of the new Democratic majority's Innovation Agenda, which is designed to make our nation more able to compete successfully in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it is essential that we invest in a workforce ready for global competition by creating a new generation of innovators and make a sustained commitment to federal research and development. We need to spur and expand affordable access to broadband, achieve energy independence, and provide small business with tools to encourage entrepreneurial innovation. <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> a critical first step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charles Drew, Benjamin Banneker, Clarence Elder, and David Crosthwait, Jr. are only a few of the names associated with great American scientific history. These engineers, scientist, and physicians were pioneers in their respective fields, and have touched all our lives in ways that we probably never consider. Whether it is enjoying the comfortable atmosphere of Radio City Music hall, navigating the streets of Washington, DC, or having a loved one receive a blood transfusion these men have all  made significant contributions to America and the world. Yet, the beautiful thing about science is its' evolutionary nature. Innovation never sleeps, and great minds are always at work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore to continue the legacy of these great men, and to ensure that America is at the forefront of new technological and scientific discoveries, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>. Representing Houston, I realize the importance of institutions like NASA and the sense of national pride that NASA can produce when they are leading the global effort in advancing science and technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, according to the National Academies, the most important thing we can do for our future economic health is to increase the nation's expertise in science, technology, math, and engineering. <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> represents a critical down-payment toward achieving this goal.

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, tonight the House took a critical step in the effort to ensure that America remains at the leading edge of the global economy by passing <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>, the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Act. The provisions in the bill, including expanded grants through the National Science Foundation and Department of Energy for early career researchers, support for research in fields of national importance, and government recruitment of young scientists build  on the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences and will help to rebuild our knowledge infrastructure. By doing so, the legislation will help America maintain its leadership in scientific research and allow American innovators to strengthen our economy by finding solutions to achieve energy independence, greater environmental protection, the development of new medical treatments, and a host of other goals. It is for these reasons that I voted to support <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I am deeply opposed to language, added to the bill through a motion to recommit, that prioritizes support for research into advanced nuclear reprocessing. Although supporters of nuclear power have renewed their efforts to increase America's reliance on nuclear power, the reality is that there are significant safety and environmental concerns associated with nuclear energy. The storage of spent nuclear fuel is a growing problem facing individual power plants and communities throughout  the nation. At the Indian Point Energy Center, there is an ongoing leak of radioactive material from spent fuel pools into the Hudson River, and throughout the country communities that host nuclear facilities are being forced to contemplate the cleanup and security costs associated with the storage of nuclear waste.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must also clearly understand that, at a time when nuclear terrorism is one of the greatest threats facing our nation, the process used to recycle spent fuel would create a significant proliferation risk by resulting in the production of plutonium that can be used in nuclear weapons. The language prioritizing support for a technology that threatens to damage our environment and undermine our national security is misguided, and tarnishes an otherwise laudable piece of legislation. I am hopeful  that this language will not be included in the conference report.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research Act. Taking its name from the sixth chapter of the National Academies Report "Rising Above the Gathering Storm," <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> is part of an ambitious legislative portfolio that is part of the Innovation Agenda. I was proud to help craft the Innovation Agenda, on which our nation is dependent for its future prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifty thousand people hold postdoctoral appointments in the United States. In 1999, postdocs were 43% of the first authors in articles in the prestigious journal Science. Postdoctoral appointments are temporary by design and are compensated poorly. Postdocs are generally motivated by the idea of becoming professors, a goal to which three quarters of postdocs aspire. However, only 20 percent will attain faculty positions. This had led to an increasingly dramatic and problematic holding pattern  which could select more for flexibility and perseverance than for talent and performance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As science funding has become tighter, it's become more difficult for postdocs to find permanent academic positions and to remain in science. The availability of positions is entirely dependent on the likelihood of a new professor finding funding. As of 2002, the median age at which one receives a first NIH grant as a primary investigator is 42. In 1981, the median age was 35. In the biological sciences, in 1980, researchers under 40 years old received more than half of all competitive research  grants. By 2003, this had fallen to less than 17 percent. At NSF, the funding rates for first-time grant recipients fell from 25 percent in 2000 to 17 percent in 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> addresses this problem by setting aside funds specifically for early career researchers, which are defined as assistant professors or the equivalent thereof. Assistant professor is the role to which most postdocs aspire as their next step. It is one step short of having a tenured, permanent position in a research institution. H.R 363 also requires DOE and NIST to report on how they are doing with recruitment and retention of early career engineers and scientists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> supports the early career part of the science and technology professional pipeline in other ways, as well. The act requires NSF to set aside at least 1.5 percent of funds appropriated for research and related activities to the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program and permits the NSF to research the process of innovation and the teaching of inventiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At present, the United States research infrastructure is deficient. In 2001, more than 60 percent of the Department of Energy Office of Science lab space was over 30 years old. This requires $2 billion to correct. In 1998, the NSF estimated that $11.4 billion were needed to  renovate U.S. academic research facilities. In 2001, the NIH estimated $5.6 billion in health research infrastructure needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This problem is in part caused by a 26 percent cap on reimbursement to universities from research grants for infrastructure costs. Since this cap was created in 1991, universities have been unable to find sufficient sources of funding to keep their scientific facilities competitive or, in some cases, adequate. At the same time, they are using these facilities to attempt to compete internationally for scientists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> addresses this problem by instructing the Office of Science and Technology Policy to create a National Coordination Office for Research Infrastructure. This office would prioritize deficiencies in research facilities at universities and national labs and then work to coordinate a response to these deficiencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution. Without its reforms to our research infrastructure and science talent pipeline we will continue to deteriorate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>, the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first want to thank Chairman Gordon for his leadership on the important issue of innovation, and commend our Committee's work towards investing in our research communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past August, I invited Chairman Gordon to join me in a panel to discuss the subject of Innovation back in St. Louis. The Event was a tremendous success and sparked a conversation about competitiveness, STEM education and innovation that still continues with enthusiasm in St. Louis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this is an issue that warrants much discussion, the time has come for bold action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, our nation's standing as the global leader in science and technology has slipped in recent years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> will counteract this worrying trend by investing in long-term scientific research and encouraging young scientists and researchers to pursue high-risk and high-reward research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the bill administers awards to outstanding early-career researchers in academia and in nonprofit research organizations, provides graduate research assistantships in areas of national need and establishes a national coordination office to prioritize university and national research infrastructure needs. By investing in our young researchers, we invest in the ideas that will shape our country's future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this bill to advance our nation's status as a leader in the global economy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>, the Sowing the Seeds through Science and Engineering Research Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill authorizes appropriations for basic research in science and engineering, and provides support of graduate fellowships, as well as research grants, to scientists and engineers in the early phases of their careers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I commend Chairman Gordon for crafting this important legislation and bringing it to the House floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must take bold steps now to insure that American students and workers are prepared for the careers of the future and that our nation is equipped to compete in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is based on the recommendations of the National Academies' widely-acknowledged "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" report, which found that the U.S. stands to lose its competitive edge in the international economy unless immediate action is taken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Statistics show that U.S. 12th-grade students performed below the international average of 21 countries on a test of general knowledge of math and science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, America graduated 70,000 engineers, while China turned out 10 times as many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that American high-tech companies often look abroad for workers who are willing to work for less pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very concerned about the issue of off-shoring and outsourcing, and it troubles me when companies say they need to go overseas just to find employees who are skilled in math and science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe there is a clear link between off-shoring and outsourcing and how these trends relate to future employment opportunities and career choices of students in the science and engineering fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we have to raise awareness of this issue and work together in a bipartisan manner in order to keep high-wage science and engineering jobs here in the U.S. and maintain our competitive edge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> puts us on the right path and demonstrates our commitment to strengthening our science, technology, engineering, and mathematics educational programs in order produce a skilled and knowledgeable workforce here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maintaining U.S. innovation and leadership demands hard work and investment. While there are no quick fixes, we can take steps, like <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>, now to accomplish these important goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, today we are considering several bills to implement the Innovation Agenda including <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>, the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In February I was pleased to support this legislation in Committee. <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> provides merit-based grants for researchers early in their careers, establishes a Presidential innovation award, and creates a national office to identify, prioritize, and coordinate research infrastructure needs at universities and national laboratories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America needs innovators and leaders if we want to remain competitive in the global economy. This is especially true when it comes to science and engineering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Retaining scientists and engineers, however, is often difficult, because they receive such low pay early-on in their careers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we don't invest early in our future innovators, we will fall behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> supports an important goal and I look forward to its passage today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400437" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>, a piece of legislation that is desperately needed to enhance tomorrow's scientific research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know what it's like to start out on our own--the uncertainty of your financial footing, but with great faith in yourself and your ideas. Imagine that feeling on an exponential scale and that might be how a young, talented researcher feels as they work on a cure for autism, or traumatic brain injury for our troops, or a new source of cleaner, renewable energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The field of research is high-risk and high-yield, and the federal government is right to invest in research that benefits us all. <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> will help "sustain and strengthen the nation's traditional commitment to long-term basic research ..... to maintain the flow of new ideas that fuel the economy, provide security, and enhance the quality of life," as prescribed by the National Academies report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm, that has been the focus of our work in the Science and Technology  Committee, and mentioned many times today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Young researchers are the key to innovation, as they are more likely than established researchers to shift paradigms, break with tradition, or bring new ideas to a discipline or to a combination of disciplines. The early-career awards outlined in this bill reward young researchers for engaging in high-risk/high-reward research that is likely to be transformative or highly innovative. The establishment of a presidential innovation award is designed to identify and recognize people who develop  the unique scientific and engineering innovations in the national interest at the time they occur. This bill doesn't simply seek to fund all science; it focuses on fostering the most innovative elements of the scientific enterprise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank Chairman Gordon, as well as Ranking Member Hall, on their hard work on this legislation, and the bipartisan manner in which the Science and Technology Committee is run to produce such substantial legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to encourage my colleagues to support my amendment. One of the key elements of this bill is a grant program at NSF designed to help scientists and engineers at early stages of their careers at institutions of higher learning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eligible applicants are tenure-track faculty, and allow the existing faculty early career development program to be designed and designated as the mechanism for awarding such grants that we are talking about here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also require the director of the NSF to allocate at least 3.5 percent of funds appropriated to the NSF research and related activities account for the purposes in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would modify the 3.5 percent allocation provision to include the following clause: "except to the extent that a sufficient number of meritorious grant applications have not been received for a fiscal year."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did this out of concern that the bill required the allocation of 3.5 percent of the funds appropriated to the earlier career awards for science and engineering, without taking into account there may be years in which there are not sufficient meritorious grant applications in that area and NSF could use the funds more effectively maybe in another area.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I am very proud to offer a bipartisan amendment with my good friend, Congresswoman JUDY BIGGERT of the Science Committee. Our amendment would expand eligibility for National Science Foundation Early Career Awards to thousands of scientists and engineers previously deemed ineligible. These men and women have followed alternative career paths such as working part-time or in non-academic settings, or have taken a significant career break or other leave of absence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, our amendment would level the playing field for women scientists who have taken maternity leaves, and for all scientists and engineers who have taken internships, worked in industry, or who have pursued entrepreneurial efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment would also expand the scope of the Presidential Innovation Award to recognize and reward innovations that result in intellectual property that significantly enhances the economic competitiveness of the United States.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I rise today in support of the Tauscher-Biggert amendment to <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>, the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineer Research Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I am pleased to have worked with my colleague from California (Mrs. Tauscher) in developing this amendment, she deserves the credit for the substance of it. I just happen to think she had a great idea, and I am honored to lend my support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, we face a world in which our economic competitors in Asia and Europe are making significant new investments in their own research capabilities, in terms of both infrastructure and human capital. These investments are beginning to pay off, as Asia and European countries challenge U.S. leadership in the sciences no matter how it is measured, by number of patterns won, articles submitted to scientific journals, Nobel Prizes won, the percentage of gross domestic product dedicated to  research and development, and even the number of degrees awarded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Report after report from the National Academies to the Task Force on the Future of American Innovation has concluded that we need more people with scientific expertise and engineering talent if we are to counter this threat. Only our national security and our economic competitiveness are at stake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the number of undergraduate degrees and Ph.D.s awarded in the U.S. in science and engineering has been flat or stagnant for over a decade; and of those undergraduates who have obtained a degree in science or engineering, only 28 percent actually go on to get their graduate degree or pursue a career in science and engineering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why this amendment is so important. It expands eligibility for the NSF Early Career Awards to the thousands of scientists and engineers who have followed alternative career paths, such as working part-time or in non-academic settings, or who have taken a significant career break but want to get back into the lab.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For instance, over 12,000 men and women with doctorates in science or engineering currently are not working because of family responsibilities, according to the most recent statistics compiled by NSF. Of those, over 11,000 are women who may be raising children or caring for a sick parent. Imagine the countless benefits of just getting these 11,000 women back into the lab.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this amendment has the potential to do so much more than that. It provides an opportunity for thousands of other people with scientific expertise and training, men and women, to get the support they need to reenter the scientific and engineering workforce and get back to doing the scientific work that is so important to the competitiveness of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment also recognizes and rewards those scientist and engineers whose innovative ideas enhance the economic competitiveness of the United States. It does so by making them eligible for the Presidential Innovation Award created by this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, by creating additional opportunities to expand the ranks of scientists and engineers and rewarding them for innovative ideas that make the Nation more economically competitive, this amendment strengthens our ability to innovate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is our ability to innovate that has made and will make America the envy of the world in terms of our freedoms, our security and our culture, health and prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the ranking member, Mr. Hall, for his support for this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, first I want to thank the chairman of the Committee on Science and Technology, Mr. Gordon, for putting forward <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>, which will increase America's competitiveness in the world by strengthening our science and research base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer this bipartisan amendment to build the pipeline for our country's future teachers, scientists, engineers and researchers by proposing 2,500 scholarships each year of full tuition to any State university or college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is based on the National Academies' strong recommendation for the Federal Government to develop an undergraduate scholarship program for students studying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This amendment will create the recommended scholarship program through the National Science Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the amendment, an undergraduate student who comes from a family with an income of less than $75,000, maintains at least a 3.0 grade point average and is studying science, technology, engineering, or mathematics may receive up to 2 years of paid tuition at that State university.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the year 2001, tuition at State universities has risen by 41 percent, making the task of paying for college much more difficult. Scholarships for bright students will increase the number of students who will have the resources to go into the STEM field and achieve their God-given potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having a home-grown, educated workforce will be crucially important to the future strength of America's economy, not only by allowing families and students who are financially stretched to continue their education at high-quality programs such as the nanotechnology program in SUNY Albany, SUNY-Delhi's College of Technology, or the Cytotechnology program at SUNY Plattsburgh, all colleges that are very important to my district in upstate New York, but because by educating America's students  in these fields, we will ensure that America retains our competitive advantage in the science field around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My upstate New York district is beginning an exciting new economic revival based on the high-tech sector, and we need to maintain a local workforce that is skilled in engineering and mathematics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Investments in higher education and science are some of the most important investments our government can make, and I urge everyone to vote "yes."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400165" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment would create a new merit scholarship program at NSF for undergraduate scholars pursuing science, technology, engineering, or mathematics degrees, the STEM degrees. To receive a scholarship, a student has to be a junior or a senior at a 4-year public institution, have at least a 3.0 grade point average, come from a family with an income of $75,000 or less, and be a citizen or a permanent resident alien with no felony conviction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Generally, I am supportive of merit scholarships, and while this particular concept sounds good, it is duplicative. An almost identical program already exists at the Department of Education. It is called the Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent Grant and is part of the President's American Competitiveness Initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Therefore, our 2008 budget request for this scholarship program is $1.2 billion. We don't need to add another $281 million scholarship program at another agency that achieves essentially the exact same thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other main reason I oppose this amendment is its effect on the bill we just debated, <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>. The driving force between <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> is to expand the Noyce Scholarship Program for undergraduates to entice them to enter the STEM K-12 teaching profession. A requirement for this scholarship is that they give back to society by obligating to teach 2 years for every year of scholarship money they receive. This amendment includes no commitment of any kind from these proposed awardees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What kind of a message are we sending if we require Noyce scholarship recipients to give back to society with a teacher service obligation, when the recipients of scholarships under this amendment have nothing to repay?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the two bills before us today, the Science Committee is also working on NSF's reauthorization, which also includes quite a bit of undergraduate STEM education improvements. I just think the amendment currently before us is not only recreating a scholarship program that is already in existence, but it's entirely inappropriate for this legislation we are considering today. I encourage my colleagues to vote against it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of Mrs. Gillibrand's amendment to <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our universities and research institutes lead the world in innovation. Today we stand at the cusp of new breakthroughs in fields ranging from medicine, to computer technology and renewable energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, too few of our undergraduates are choosing to enter  science-related fields. In order to continue our remarkable record of achievement, we must do a better job of encouraging students to pursue careers in science, mathematics and engineering. This amendment will provide scholarships for science students from low- and moderate-income families, and will help young Americans realize their potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a chance today to open new doors for our children, and we should seize this opportunity. This amendment will benefit students and our Nation. I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in support of this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to Dr. EHLERS, the gentleman from Michigan.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 2 1/2  minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I also rise in opposition to this amendment, although I would say I would be delighted to support it if we could also be guaranteed that the budget of the National Science Foundation would be increased by another $1 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say that because the National Science Foundation has not been treated well in its budgets over the last 12 or 13 years. It has increased very slowly. We even had a decrease 2 years ago for the first time in many, many years. It's a shame that we have not treated the National Science Foundation adequately. It has hurt our Nation, it has hurt our economy, and we certainly have to improve that situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are in a catchup mode. I am reminded of former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who was instrumental in getting the doubling of the National Institutes of Health, who today has told me, and I have heard him tell audiences in speeches a number of times, that he regards one of his great mistakes, perhaps the greatest, the failure to double the National Science Foundation at the same time that we doubled the NIH.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevertheless, that didn't happen, so we are in a period of poverty for the National Science Foundation. Therefore, I oppose adding a new program. Even though at this point it's only $281 million, I am sure it will be a popular program and end up costing well over $1 billion. We simply cannot afford it at this time. I would be happy to consider this proposal at some time in the future if we, in fact, do double the NSF as we hope. But even that will leave us with a skimpy budget there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other factor is that this program does already exist in the Department of Education. It's a very good program. It has been in operation for several years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that we will keep that in mind, that we will turn down this amendment at this point, and perhaps consider it sometime in the future when we are bound to have an abundance of money at the National Science Foundation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished chairman, Mr. Gordon.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400155" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me say I can understand the concerns of the opponent of this amendment. There are programs that are similar in the Department of Education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me point out only 15 percent of the graduates in the United States receive a degree in engineering, where in China it's 50 percent; in Singapore it's 67 percent. It would seem there is still room to improve this statistic in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the gentlelady's amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412223" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to briefly respond to my colleague's arguments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the remarks of the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers). I thought they were very thoughtful, and I appreciate your long-term vision for the growth of science and technology deficit in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I disagree with the analysis of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hall). Primarily his argument seemed to say that this program is too expensive. But this is about our national security, it's about our economic security, and what is so necessary right now in our vision for America's future is the investment in the next generation. What we need to be is producing graduates who have science, math and technology expertise so that we can be competitive with both China and India in the generations  and decades to come. We need to begin to fund the pipeline. I think the argument of being too expensive is misplaced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, I would like to say this is a priority for our Nation, and I think we can all agree to strengthen our economy, and our national security has to be number one.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400392" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I stand before Congress to offer this motion to recommit because we must encourage new innovations in domestic energy supply. This motion to recommit gives priority to grants to expand domestic energy production through the use of coal-to-liquids technology and advanced nuclear reprocessing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> already emphasizes the need for increased science and engineer research grants, especially with regard to our Nation's young people. What it does not emphasize is the need for further diversification of our energy sources that will help achieve American energy independence and energy security. World energy demand is expected to increase by over 50 percent by the year 2030, a startling statistic, for sure. In America alone, energy demand is expected to increase by one-third.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no one simple solution to arrive at energy independence and energy security. There are, in fact, several pieces to the energy puzzle. It is vital that we wean America off unstable foreign sources of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress must urge researchers to invest time and money into the rich technology of coal-to-liquid and nuclear reprocessing. We must commit to support coal-to-liquid technologies for the total life cycle, from coal extraction, through benefaction, processing, refining, packaging, distribution and end product consumption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been said that the United States is the Saudi Arabia of coal. If we can economically produce liquid transportation fuel from coal, we could displace barrels of unstable foreign oil with barrels of domestically produced fuel. As America's most abundant domestic energy source, coal is an obvious choice to diversify our transportation fuels mix and to reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources. If we invest in coal-to-liquid fuels technology in the early stages, we can take one more  step towards energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several countries, including France and Japan, are already reprocessing their spent nuclear fuel. It is important for our young scientists and engineers to learn how to develop this progression of reprocessing nuclear fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 20 years, the number of university nuclear engineering programs has declined from 65 to 29. These young engineers should be encouraged to reuse nuclear fuel in an efficient and cost-effective way. This motion to recommit will promote our colleges to train our future scientists and engineers. In an aging nuclear workforce it is important that these young people are properly trained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to encourage American energy supply through the development  of coal-to-liquid and advanced nuclear technologies. With these technologies we can achieve this energy independence we so desperately need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This motion to recommit will allow us to meet this energy demand on our own terms by giving priority to grants to expand domestic energy production through the use of coal-to-liquids technology and advanced nuclear reprocessing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield some time to the gentleman from Illinois, Congressman Shimkus.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400373" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Oklahoma for bringing forth this motion to recommit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been down here a couple of times on other motions to recommit, and they are very similar to what we are addressing now. This is a call to my fossil fuel Democrats, my coal Democrats, to address the need of our energy security issues and help us with this motion to recommit to say that what we need to do is address, in this bill, and prioritize coal-to-liquid research and development. And just as important, the global security needs and the global warming with carbon sequestration. This  motion to recommit will help prioritize these educational funds to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Likewise, for those who support nuclear power, especially those who feel that there is a concern of high-level nuclear waste, that we learn how to properly reprocess that fuel so we can use that to help our energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate my colleague from Oklahoma, and I hope I have my friends on the other side support this motion to recommit.</paragraph>
