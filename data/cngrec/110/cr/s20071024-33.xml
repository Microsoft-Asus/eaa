    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to one of America's finest military leaders, Air Force MG Roger P. Lempke, on the occasion of his retirement as adjutant general of the Nebraska National Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Guard has been tested by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan more than any period since World War II. Nationally, it has been a true test of the Guard to maintain strength at home and abroad during a time of lengthy deployments, mounting casualties, declining recruitment, and a shortage of equipment. Yet, in Nebraska during this period, under the competent leadership of General Lempke, the Nebraska National Guard has continued to thrive, pulling in record numbers of recruits, increasing  retention, and establishing an active family support program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Lempke instills confidence, not only in the troops he commands and their families but in the elected officials he serves. Since the tragic attacks of September 11, 2001, and during the time of war that has followed, we are fortunate to have had his very capable leadership as he oversaw the National Guard's changing role into an active duty combat force. The American people have seen vividly that the National Guard is no longer a supplemental force; it serves in seamless fashion with the  active duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As past president of the National Association of State Adjutants General, General Lempke has been a vocal advocate for the National Guard, working with the Pentagon to help shape policies on issues ranging from base closures to troop strength. A graduate of the Air Force Academy, this even-tempered Nebraska farm boy and devoted husband and father rose through the ranks to become a respected military leader, not only in Nebraska but among his peers nationally. He and I have worked closely together  on many projects which benefited not only Nebraska but helped our Nation's military as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will miss that close association with the general as our professional relationship comes to a close, but on a personal level, I will always be proud to call Roger P. Lempke a trusted and respected friend.</paragraph>
