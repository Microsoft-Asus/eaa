    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, $2.32 for a gallon of gas, $2.99 for a gallon of milk, $20 or $25 for a single day of childcare. These are real prices and, too often, real choices that working Americans face every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Vermont, and across America, we have had a proud tradition of self-reliance and sense of community. We need to combine these two values, self-reliance on the one hand and community on the other, by rewarding work and making work pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We send a message every day to our citizens and our workers that we value work and that government has a role to play in ensuring opportunity to everyone willing to contribute. It is time we matched that message with our own leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no accident that in Vermont and more than 20 States around the country, Republicans and Democrats, working together, have led in the effort to reward work with a reasonable minimum wage above our national minimum last set nearly a decade ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are few more important tasks before us than addressing the growing economic gap between America's wealthiest citizens and low income workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, millionaires were given tax breaks that put an average of $40,000 in their pockets, and yet middle class workers who earn less than $20,000 received just two dollars. Two dollars--for the whole year. That is rewarding wealth rather than work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today a full-time minimum wage worker earns just $10,712 annually--more than $2,000 below the poverty line for a family of two. Asking millions of our neighbors to work full time without a wage above poverty is wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that Congress must raise the federal minimum wage to $7.25 an hour to help life every minimum wage worker out of poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today and together, we can begin to restore a balance, by rewarding work and not just wealth, acknowledging we are all in this together.</paragraph>
