  <speaking speaker="400340" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have the sad duty as the dean of the Kentucky delegation to inform the Members of the passing of our former colleague from Kentucky's Fourth District, Gene Snyder, who served some 20 years in this body until he retired in 1986. He passed away on February 16 of this year in Florida. His funeral and interment in Louisville took place last Saturday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those who would desire, there will be a Special Order taken out by his successor in that district, GEOFF DAVIS, tonight around 8:45. If you would like to participate in the Special Order, time will be available.</paragraph>
