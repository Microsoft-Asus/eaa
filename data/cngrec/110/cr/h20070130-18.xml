  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Iranians and Saudis are uniting to try to avoid a war in Lebanon while the U.S. stays on the sidelines. Meanwhile, the Bush administration is isolating our Nation from Europe and trying to force Europe to block Iranian exports and freeze assets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. should be standing for peaceful resolution of conflict. Instead, the White House escalates conflict: escalates with Iran, escalates in Iraq, escalates violence, escalates deaths, and escalates the Federal deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want the Bush administration to know there will be constitutional consequences for the President and the Vice President if this administration continues to move towards war with Iran.</paragraph>
