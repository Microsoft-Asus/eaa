    <paragraph>Madam President, this April, more than 1,200 students from across the country visited Washington, DC, to take part in the national finals of We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution, an educational program developed to educate young people about the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education by act of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to announce that a class from Trumbull High School of Trumbull, CT, received an Honorable Mention Award at this prestigious national event. Seven Honorable Mention Awards were presented to schools placing 4th through 10th on the final day of competition. These outstanding students, through their knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, won their statewide competition and earned the chance to come to our Nation's Capitol and compete at the national level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While in Washington, the students participated in a 3-day academic competition that simulates a congressional hearing in which they "testify" before a panel of judges. Students demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of constitutional principles as they evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased to note that the We the People curriculum is aligned with the National Standards for Civics and Government and correlates with the social studies standards of many states.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The names of these outstanding students from Trumbull High School are: Alexa Alexander, Akanksha Bajaj, Rebecca Chadwick, Chelsea Clyde, Ashley Cohen, Shane Connolly, Victoria Costello, Mulan Cui, Megan Denstedt, Jackson Dolan, Adam Drenkard, Mike Finik, George Fitzpatrick, Casey Gardiner, Blake Ludwig, Alex Mosello, Elisa Odoardi, Alison Ornitz, Matt Pankracij, Mary Santella, Jaclyn Siegel, Matt Socha, Edward Tillistrand, and Stephen Wagner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also wish to commend the teacher of the class, Mike Margonis, who is responsible for preparing these young constitutional experts for the national finals. Also worthy of special recognition are Jim Schmidt and Julie Jaquish, the State coordinators, and Lorna Gallagher, the district coordinator, who are among those responsible for implementing the We the People program in my state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate these students on their exceptional achievement at the We the People national finals.</paragraph>
