    <paragraph>Mr. President, 50 years ago on June 8, 1957, Clovis Air Force Base was renamed Cannon Air Force Base. On this anniversary, I would like to like to pay tribute to the men and women who have and continue to serve at Cannon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cannon was named after GEN John Kenneth Cannon who commanded Army Air Corps forces in the Mediterranean and later was commanding general of all Army Air Corps forces in Europe during the Second World War. After the war, General Cannon served  as commander in chief of U.S. Air Forces Europe and commanding general of Tactical Air Command. During his service, General Cannon earned four Distinguished Service Medals, a Legion of Merit, a Bronze Star, and the  Air Medal. He also received decorations from Great Britain, France, Italy, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Morocco.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the last 50 years the service men and women who called Cannon home have been deployed numerous times around the world to ensure the national security of our country. They have performed their duty faithfully and in a manner that I am sure would make General Cannon proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year we will see major changes at Cannon as the 27th Fighter Wing is deactivated in preparation for the impending arrival of the 16th Special Operations Wing in October. While we are excited for the arrival of the 16th Special Operations Wing, we are sad to see the men and women of the 27th Fighter Wing go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the coming years I am sure the 16th Special Operations Wing will continue the 27th Fighter Wing's long tradition of excellence at Cannon. Again, I would like to thank the men and women, past and present, who have made Cannon a source of national pride.</paragraph>
