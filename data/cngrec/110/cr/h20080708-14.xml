    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come to you today to help with some statistics that I thought you might be interested in. The fact is that we have a new majority. We have had a new majority now for about 18 months or so in this body. I wanted to give you some statistics about what has happened since the new majority has taken over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A gallon of gas has gone from $2.35 to $4.11, an increase of $1.76. A loaf of bread has gone from $1.14 to $1.37, a 23-cent increase. A gallon of milk has gone from $3 to $3.76 a gallon. Dow Jones has gone from 12,463 to 11,812, losing 651 points.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American people I think were misled with the new majority. But I think business and Wall Street and the price to consumers is now telling the tale of exactly what high taxes and the threat of high taxes and the willingness to be energy dependent is costing the American people.</paragraph>
