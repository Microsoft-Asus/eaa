  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="JUSTICE ASSISTANCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Lampson).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every year, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or NCMEC, receives funding through the Justice Assistance Account's Missing Children Program. For the past several years, the House has allocated funding in the Missing Children Program to NCMEC; however, in this year's bill, there is no allocation. My amendment carves out of the Missing Children Program $34 million for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Authorized by Congress in section 404 of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, the National Center is a true public-private partnership, funded in the current fiscal year by Congress at $26.6 million and augmented by $11 million in private sector donations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its inception in 1984, NCMEC has handled more than 2.1 million calls, trained 226,000 professionals, printed and distributed over 42 million publications, worked more than 130,300 missing children's cases, and perhaps most importantly, played a role in the recovery of more than 112,900 children. In fact, NCMEC's total recovery rate is an impressive 96.3 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the National Center operates the CyberTipline, the congressionally mandated "911 for the Internet." NCMEC has handled more than 475,000 leads since March 1998. These leads have resulted in hundreds of arrests and prosecutions for such crimes as child pornography, online enticement of children, and sexual molestation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, for generations the message was simple. Parents told their children to never talk to strangers. My parents told me, and I told my children. Times have changed. There are more threats to our children, and our message must change with technology. Similarly, the role of the National Center has changed. The Internet opened a new world of child exploitation, and in order to sufficiently protect our children, we must give the National Center the resources it needs to help keep our children  safe and at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I know that you are committed to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and I know that this will be an important issue discussed at conference, and I understand that you would like me to withdraw this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>We have funded this account handsomely. The bill provides $61.4 million for missing children programs. As we move to conference, I know the gentlelady is interested in funding for particular organizations to focus on the problem. We are as well. At the same time, we want the universe to be able to access these programs, and that's the way we have structured our bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into a colloquy with the chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the committee. Many of you remember, last year I was down here haranguing the committee for dropping the "O" for oceans out of NOAA, and I want to thank the chairman for putting the "O" back into the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration in this year's CJS appropriations bill, and I want to thank the gentleman for providing ample funding for the National Marine Sanctuary program as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the funds in the sanctuary program's construction account that I would like to ask the chairman about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary would like to build a visitor's center in the city of Santa Cruz. This center will be the only one of its kind in the country. The site was chosen because it attracts people that do not regularly have access to the ocean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding that this project is one of NOAA's highest priorities, and they intend to grant the city of Santa Cruz $5 million from the construction account for the visitors center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question is, is it the intent of the committee to support the partnership between NOAA and the city of Santa Cruz by providing NOAA with the necessary funds so that they can grant the $5 million to the city of Santa Cruz for the construction of the visitors center? The money is included in the bill.</paragraph>

  <narrative>Amendment offered by Mr. Etheridge:</narrative>
  <narrative> Page 41, line 20, insert "(increased by $1,747,111)" after the dollar amount.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400125" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment with my colleague, Mr. Reichert of Washington State, to force the administration to really do right by the widows and orphans of fallen public safety officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For nearly 4 years, the U.S. Department of Justice has been dragging its  feet on providing benefits to the families of brave men and women who have died in the line of duty protecting their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are more than 200 claims, some of which have been waiting for decisions since 2003, languishing in the Public Safety Officers' Benefits office at the Office of Justice Programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is in clear conflict with the intent of Congress, which unanimously passed the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act to expedite cases and streamline the process. Instead, there has been delay after delay from the Department of Justice, and the PSOB office has created an incredibly complicated system that even personnel at the PSOB office have been confused by.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would simply ensure that there are enough benefits personnel to deal with this backlog, enough appeals officers to address the concerns of families who are wrongfully denied, and additional managers or ombudsmen to help streamline claims and interact with claimants to make an emotional and difficult process easier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We owe our first responders no less than to be sure that their loved ones are taken care of if they fall while working to ensure that our communities are safe. These families should not have to jump through hoop after hoop to receive what they justly deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JoAnn Tilton of Katy, Texas, whose husband, Fire Chief Gary Tilton, died of a heart attack after responding to a traffic accident, has waited 2 1/2  years to hear from the PSOB office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In that time she has been asked for volumes of information, been given conflicting information. She had basically been given the runaround in a bureaucratic marathon. She is one of the lucky ones, because at least she has gotten information from the PSOB office, even though that information includes having been told that a decision would be made earlier this month, before going forward with the claim. Now she is going to have to go through a second round of medical information reviews.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shelly Hardin of Hope Mills, North Carolina, whose husband, Sergeant James Heath Hardin, died of a heart attack while working to apprehend a criminal, did not even receive notice from the PSOB office that their claim was being processed. The PSOB office still cannot say when they will begin the processing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are but two of the hundreds of individuals whose lives have been tragically disrupted, once by the death of the loved ones, and whose lives continue to be disrupted by the Department's delays. These additional funds will make sure that they wait no longer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The brave men and women who serve our communities every day, many of whom volunteer their time, don't ask when they get a call from someone in distress. They act immediately, and the Justice Department should do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The history of the Hometown Heroes Act is riddled with delays. The first delay came when they proposed regulations that were in direct conflict with the legislation. Then came more delays when they quibbled over wording and phrases and claims that they were waiting for approval from the OMB.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It took 3 years to finalize the process. Since the law went into effect, only 10 families have been approved for the Hometown Heroes benefit out of 264 that have applied. Forty-seven claims have been denied, and more than 200 families still await a verdict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Justice Department appears to be intentionally misinterpreting the intent of Congress to create the presumption that the death was caused by work in the line of duty. I urge the Justice Department to act swiftly and fairly on the remaining claims to provide the needed benefits, the much-deserved benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support these amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Washington is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400660" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am proud to stand today with my good friend Mr. Etheridge in support of this amendment to the CJS appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 4 years ago the President signed into law the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Act. This legislation, which was championed by the author of this amendment Mr. Etheridge, corrected a technicality in how public safety officers' benefits were paid. Specifically, the law allowed for families of those killed in the line of duty, by heart attack or stroke, to claim the benefit. It sounds simple.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I didn't have the opportunity to vote for this legislation because at the time I was the sheriff in King County, Seattle, Washington, completing my 33-year law enforcement career. During my time as a police officer, I saw firsthand the pain that a family endures when they lose a loved one. I have lost partners over those 33 years that I was in the Sheriff's Office in Seattle. I know that pain. It doesn't go away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But yet they go out on the street day after day after day, and they put their lives on the line. Their families are standing there with them. Unfortunately, the families, who are dealing with this pain, and who are eligible for this compensation under the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Act, are being stalled and denied by our government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It took the Department of Justice almost 3 years just to issue a rule that would dictate how these benefits would be paid. On top of the 3 years, in the last 10 months, since the rule was issued, only 10 claims have been completed favorably, which averages to 1 claim a month. There are approximately 200 claims left, as Mr. Etheridge indicated, still in limbo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have seen the tears of these families. We just met with three families last week. Through the Federal Government's inaction and complacency, more tears will be shed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is absolutely unacceptable, outrageous. This amendment is simple. It will double the current funding for the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program. This amendment will take away the excuse that the Department of Justice does not have the people or the resources to process these claims. The issue of taking care of first responders, as I have said, is close to my heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's take care of the families. Let's implement a law that we put into the books years ago. Passage of this amendment will send a strong message to our Nation's first responders that we, the United States Government, truly stand behind them and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please support the Etheridge-Reichert amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Rhode Island is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400215" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the Etheridge-Reichert amendment. The Attorney General of the United States, Alberto Gonzales, was up here on the Hill this week. The Attorney General was trying to appeal to the United States Congress of the United States, trying to appeal to the American people to restore the American people's confidence in the Justice Department. I think one of the first steps he can take to restore confidence in the American people and the Department of Justice  is to ensure that the people who are on the front lines of the war against terror here in our own country, the men and women in blue, the people who are protecting our men and women across this country from crime, in our neighborhoods and our cities and our towns, that those</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The notion that we're going to make them wait for an insurance policy, make their families wait, make their widows wait, make their orphans wait, is an insult. The fact that the Department of Justice is not willing to simply step up and pay $250,000 tax-free dollars to the widow and children of fallen officers who have fallen in the line of duty protecting people in this country from the criminal element of this society is unforgivable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact that this Attorney General is up here on the Hill and has no understanding of this, has no sensitivity to this, is one more example of how out of touch this Attorney General is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment, this Etheridge amendment, is another example of how this Congress has to remind the executive branch who needs to be in charge when it comes to running the pursestrings around here, where the priorities of the American people are. The priorities of the American people are let's spend money where our law enforcement is. That is where their families are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This, my friends, is where our hometown heroes are. In my State we have people like Deputy Assistant Day, who died trying to fight a fire, and his family's widow is still waiting for that benefit. In the 1970s, President Nixon put the public safety officers' benefit in at $100,000. We never even increased it. We tried to increase it; wasn't even increased for rate of inflation, cost-of-living adjustment. I worked to try to increase it, as did Mr. Etheridge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It took 9/11, unfortunately, it took a crisis like 9/11, before we were able to attach this bill to the PATRIOT Act and get it included as part of the PATRIOT Act and get it pushed through this Congress so that we could increase it up to over $250,000. Now that it's up there, and it's tied to the rate of inflation, it's there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it's not going to do a lot of good unless it's going out the door, and it's going into the pockets and into the households and the families that need it. That's why we need to pass this amendment to give the administration and the Department of Justice the resources it needs in order to give them no more excuses in order to process these claims and get those families the resources they need in order to take care of the widows and the orphans of our fallen heroes.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400281" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Mr. Etheridge's amendment. I can tell you that the beneficiaries of the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program and the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Program are extremely lucky to have advocates like Mr. Etheridge in the United States House of Representatives. I mention him first and most often because he has been all over this issue for the last 6 months, since I have been chairman of this subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am extremely pleased to see Mr. Reichert on this, a person who comes from law enforcement, who understands the issues of law enforcement, and is probably personally acquainted with cases of disappointment of beneficiaries under this program. It is tremendous that this program is bipartisan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You can tell by Mr. Kennedy's remarks and the sincerity behind them that this is an issue of vital concern to the subcommittee as well. Mr. Kennedy has been championing Mr. Etheridge's cause and Mr. Reichert's cause through the process of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I give credit to these people because they have been especially attentive to this concern. It is, indeed, something that we should be concerned about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we talk about homeland security, as we talk about State and local law enforcement, and as we recommend a bill with this kind of funding to the House of Representatives, we have to be mindful of those people who have made sacrifices and who have suffered greatly. That's what these programs are about. That's why the Congress authorized them, and that's why we have provided appropriations for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not acceptable that the Department of Justice has not moved these beneficiary cases, with far greater expediency than they have. It is actually a denial of the benefit that some of these cases have been processed so slowly. So that's the initiative, that's the purpose of Mr. Etheridge's amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to accept the amendment because of its merit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield to my ranking member, who has likewise been passionate about ensuring that the Department of Justice moves these beneficiary programs in the Office of Justice programs.</paragraph>

  <narrative>Amendment offered by Mr. Chabot:</narrative>
  <narrative> Page 47, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert "(reduced by $15,000,000)".</narrative>
  <narrative> Page 47, line 14, after the dollar amount, insert "(increased by $15,000,000)".&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. CHABOT (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered as read and printed in the Record.</narrative>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400071" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment is really very straightforward. It would add $15 million to the $15 million presently designated for jurisdictions experiencing a high rate of violent and drug trafficking crime involving firearms. My amendment would offset this increase by taking $15 million from a new offender reentry program that the underlying bill appears to authorize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, there is no doubt that reentry programs play a critical role in the criminal justice system, ensuring that offenders who are released back into our communities receive the assistance they need to make them productive members of our communities. Indeed, millions of offenders are released back into our communities each year. More often than not, these individuals are released back into society without support, increasing the likelihood of recidivism, jeopardizing the safety of our  communities, and ultimately increasing the cost to society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fiscal year 2006, more than $13 million in Federal funds were awarded to States to assist them with their reentry programs. During that same year, more than $146 million was allocated to the Federal Bureau of Prisons to help community corrections centers across the Nation get inmates who are close to being released the assistance they needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress, the House is set to consider <bill type="h" number="1593">H.R. 1593</bill>, the Second Chance Act of 2007, of which I am an original cosponsor. This legislation would, among other things, reauthorize State and local adult and juvenile reentry programs at a level of $65 million for fiscal year 2008 and 2009. Yet, at the same time we cannot forget the needs of our communities. More must be done to give State and local law enforcement the resources they need to combat the violent crime and gang activity that continues  to plague our cities, including my city, Cincinnati, particularly violent crimes committed with firearms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Bureau of Justice statistics, in 2005, 65 percent of all murders, 42 percent of all robberies, and 21 percent of all aggravated assaults that were reported to police were committed with firearms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, the violent crime associated with gang activity continues to leave residents in our Nation's cities and towns feeling like prisoners in their own homes. In my own city, Cincinnati, crimes committed with firearms, local gang activity, and drug trafficking continue to threaten the well-being of law-abiding citizens. In fact, this past spring the Cincinnati City Council voted to obtain the help of renowned Professor David Kennedy to assist the city in fighting violent crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Making additional funds available in this jurisdiction and jurisdictions across the country will empower residents of cities and towns to take back their communities and make them a safer place to live and work and raise our families. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from West Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400281" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I admit to being a bit confused by the gentleman's logic here, who I have great respect and great regard for. He comes out of an exemplary academic background, and I can't imagine how we could be thinking differently on this amendment. Nevertheless, we do, and I rise in strong opposition to the amendment as I understand it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly pleased that the bill provides $80 million for State and local grants to address violent crime and gun crime across the Nation, the two issues that the gentleman expresses concern about. I hope he agreed with the committee when we increased funding for this purpose by $35 million over 2007. I have to oppose his amendment because of the offset of $15 million for law enforcement costs of offender reentry programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the programs that go hand in glove with our other law enforcement activities. Recidivism is a terrible problem. These programs establish partnerships with correctional institutions, with community corrections, with social services, with faith-based institutions and with community policing groups. They want to help make our communities safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's prisons are bursting at the seams. In the Federal prisons alone we have an inmate population that has risen six-fold since 1980; we have 195,000 inmates in Federal prison. The recidivism rate is 40 percent, and in the States it is 67 percent. If we reduce those numbers, we are dramatically not only reducing crime in the country and reducing the recidivism rate in the process, we are doing both at one time. So these statistics being deplorable, we need more resources applied to addressing  recidivism. For those reasons, I must oppose the gentleman's amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In light of the fact that we have increased funding significantly for the violent gang and the gun crimes across the country by $35 million and by providing $80 million in this bill, that seems to be a healthy increase for that purpose that the gentleman expressed his concern about.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400071" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400281" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Ohio.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400071" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to first of all compliment him for the fact that he also attended an institution which I think is probably one of the best colleges in the country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400281" topic="">
    <paragraph>It certainly is.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400071" topic="">
    <paragraph>We happened to go to the same college, by the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As far as the committee report, it says that the committee directs that the remaining $15 million will be available to jurisdictions experiencing a high rate of violent and drug trafficking crime involving firearms. And we certainly support that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are trying to do is increase that, because we think there should be additional funding because we do believe that gang activity and violence is plaguing a number of communities, including the one that I happen to represent, the city of Cincinnati. And when we looked into the bill, when we called the committee for further clarification about what the other $15 million went toward, we were told that this provision had been inserted in previous Congresses, but that they weren't really sure  what, if any, reentry program that they were referring to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So rather than just let the money sit, I propose to give it to those jurisdictions that are falling victim to violent crime and drug traffickers, particularly those that are committed with firearms. And I don't believe that the $15 million, as I said, that is currently in the bill is sufficient. And since this money was available and wasn't designated, to our knowledge, in any particular program, we thought that it would be appropriate to increase the funding so that we could help more cities  better fight against gang activity and violence, and particularly when those are involved with firearms.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400281" topic="">
    <paragraph>I can assure the gentleman that I am fully in support of his purpose. This is the first time that I have been introduced to his concerns specifically, and I am advised our staff haven't really talked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know if there is a way that the gentleman feels we can accommodate him.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400281" topic="">
    <paragraph>I just can't believe that we cannot do that, if the gentleman would wish to withdraw his amendment.</paragraph>
