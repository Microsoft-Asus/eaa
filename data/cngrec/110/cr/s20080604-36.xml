  <narrative>HONORING DOLPHIN MINI GOLF -- (Senate - June 04, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5036">S5036</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize a small business from my home State of Maine that recently hosted the 2008 U.S. ProMiniGolf Association's U.S. Open Tournament. Dolphin Mini Golf, an 18-hole, par 50 miniature golf course located in the charming Midcoast town of Boothbay, is the first location in the Northeast to host this exciting annual event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dolphin Mini Golf is no ordinary miniature golf course. A nautical theme pervades the landscape, with each hole having a unique decoration. Laden with challenging obstacles, from a fisherman's house to a whale's eye, and dotted with dolphins, lighthouses, and anchors, the course is a taxing test for even the most advanced miniature golfer. Additionally, the rotating ship's wheel and spinning lobster buoys provide the course with an added level of difficulty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A perfect attraction for tourists to the Maine coast and locals alike, Dolphin Mini Golf has earned its reputation as one of the country's premier miniature golf entertainment complexes. In fact, Dolphin has been rated as one of the top 10 mini golf courses nationwide by several professionals on multiple occasions in USA Today. This made Dolphin Mini Golf an ideal location for the recent 11th annual U.S. Open Tournament, which was held on May 17 and 18 and organized by the U.S. ProMiniGolf Association,  which promotes the increased play of miniature golf and sanctions several tournaments each year. This year's U.S. Open featured entrants from across the United States and Europe and consisted of six separate events, including a junior tournament, as well as senior and amateur divisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dolphin's owner, Lee Stoddard, decided to use the opportunity of hosting the event to highlight something bigger than sports. He selected Operation Recognition, a non-profit organization that recognizes America's servicemembers by providing them with a week of relaxation in Maine, to receive proceeds from the U.S. Open. Operation Recognition was founded in May 2007, and its vacations provide military families with all-expense-paid trips, including lodging, scenic boat tours, and, naturally,  passes to play at Dolphin Mini Golf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to this year's U.S. Open, Dolphin Mini Golf hosts its own tournament each September. This 14-year tradition draws players from near and far to benefit a good cause: the tournament raises money for Shriners Hospitals for Children in New England. These crucial facilities provide treatment for children with a variety of illnesses and ailments, including burn  victims, orthopedic care, and spinal cord injury rehabilitation. Mr. Stoddard's commitment  to the welfare of the region's neediest children is truly admirable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dolphin Mini Golf is a fitting symbol of Maine's creative entrepreneurship. But under Lee Stoddard's leadership, it also represents a sincere kindness and compassion. Through sheer hard work and dedication, Mr. Stoddard has turned Dolphin into an exemplary miniature golf course and a standout small business. I congratulate everyone at Dolphin Mini Golf for earning the honor of playing host to this year's U.S. Open Tournament and thank them for their considerable generosity to our Nation's veterans  and children.</paragraph>
