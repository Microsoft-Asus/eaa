    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, extending the existing Andean Trade Preference Act for Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador through 2008 is a necessary measure, but one that only goes halfway. It cannot substitute for passage of the Colombia Free Trade Agreement, which is of central importance in defending critical U.S. strategic interests in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colombia has been an indispensable ally in the fight to keep drugs off American streets, and it has successfully battled armies of narcoterrorists even as it has consolidated its democracy. It is a steadfast partner in an increasingly unstable region where enemies of the United States and strategic competitors are making rapid advances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the strongest argument for the Colombian Free Trade Agreement is that although it would benefit Colombia enormously, it would benefit the United States even more. Those opposed to the Colombia FTA do not understand that the existing trade preferences give Colombian businesses easy access to U.S. markets but do nothing about giving U.S. businesses greater access to Colombia's markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, only the free trade agreement can do that. Let us pass it soon.</paragraph>
