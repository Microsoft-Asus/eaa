    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great sadness but great honor that I rise to commemorate the life and actions of Gerald R. Ford, the 38 President of the United States. President Ford led our country through turbulent and uncertain times and did so with a kind of strong modesty that he was known for his entire life. From his days as a star of the University of Michigan football team to serving as minority leader in the U.S. House of Representatives, Gerald Ford's ability to lead was apparent  to all. Aside from his leadership qualities, President Ford was a man beyond reproach and respected by all. These qualities made him Richard Nixon's choice to replace his first Vice President, Spiro Agnew. Following President Nixon's resignation, Gerald Ford returned honor to the office of the President</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I join with all North Carolinians and all Americans in mourning the passing of President Gerald Ford. I was privileged to call President Ford a dear friend for more than 30 years, and my husband Bob and I continue to keep Betty and the entire Ford family in our thoughts and prayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford presided over America during some of her most difficult and challenging times. Immediately upon entering the Oval Office, President Ford was confronted with a myriad of problems--a faltering economy, energy shortages, international disputes, and a nation disheartened and disillusioned by scandal. He confronted these challenges head-on, and he did so with honesty, integrity, common sense, and decency. He was a true American patriot who never failed to put the interests of his country  above his own political interests. And, to me, that is the embodiment of a true leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Long before entering the White House, President Ford had a distinguished and successful career. He diligently represented the people of Michigan in the U.S. House of Representatives for 25 years, including 8 years serving as House minority leader. Throughout each chapter of his career, President Ford displayed extraordinary care and thoughtfulness as he worked tirelessly to bring together his colleagues--from both sides of the ideological spectrum--for the betterment of our Nation. And in turn,  his colleagues respected him, relied on his wise judgment, and valued his leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my husband Bob says, President Ford was the type of person you would want as your next-door neighbor. He was humble, down-to-earth, and accessible. What you saw with President Ford was what you got.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to having the honor of serving in President Ford's administration as a Federal Trade Commissioner, I had the privilege of spending a good bit of time with President Ford and his dear wife Betty when my husband campaigned as his running mate in 1976. During this time, I saw a side of the President that I wish every American could have seen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will never forget the day when President Ford announced that Bob would be his running mate. We were in Bob's hometown of Russell, KS, and my mother-in-law wanted very much to serve a home-cooked fried chicken dinner to the President. But when President Ford and Bob arrived at her home, they discovered that Mrs. Dole had accidentally locked herself out of the house. So there was the President of the United States standing on the front stoop patiently waiting for Mrs. Dole to  find the spare key. She was a nervous wreck, but the President didn't mind one bit--instead, he kindly offered to help her find the key, so together they searched until they found it behind a drainpipe. I have always thought this story about a small</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford served the United States with courage and distinction, and he provided a shining example for all public servants to follow. I am so proud to have known this man of character, strength, and intellect. I will miss my friend, and I wish the best to Betty, his children, Michael, John, Steven, and Susan, and the entire Ford family.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to state how proud I was to support Senate Resolution 19, celebrating the life of the late President Gerald R. Ford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was an honor to commemorate the extraordinary legacy of the 38th President of the United States, Gerald Rudolph Ford, as we have mourned the loss of a treasured national leader and exceptional public servant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford will forever be remembered for his unassailable integrity and decency, at a most difficult and challenging time. He was truly a great American who devoted his life not only to the Nation he loved but also to the finest and most ennobling ideals of public service. Throughout the years, President Ford represented a voice of civility and problem-solving--of consensus-building--and healing. History will record that his contribution to America's story was both indispensable and irrefutable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When our Nation looked to him for assurance, his stalwart character, disposition, and judgment instilled a quiet and renewed confidence in our country. He restored the public trust in the Presidency and in our Government, reminded us of the strength and durability of our Constitution, and engendered a hope that tempered our anxieties and turned our attention once again to the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his distinguished 25 years as both a Member and later minority  leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, then-Congressman Gerald Ford never sought the office of Vice President or President, but when in 1974 he faced the daunting task of assuming the highest office in the land, his steadfast dedication to the bedrock principles of hardwork, common sense, and duty--so emblematic of his upbringing and his remarkable career in Congress--prepared  him to occupy the White House and served him well over the course of his brief but historic tenure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With an unwavering moral compass, a certain grasp of purpose, and an always-steady resolve, President Ford guided us out of conflict abroad and quelled our concerns here at home and in doing so brought honor to the Oval Office and reassurance to Americans. It is fitting that in football as well as in his public life, Gerald Ford was ever the keystone, the center that held those around him together, who exemplified the essential underpinning that made progress possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal note, last summer I had the esteemed privilege of cosponsoring--along with Senators Warner, Stevens, and Levin--an amendment offered by Senator John Warner to the 2007 Defense authorization bill that would name our Nation's newest carrier the "USS Gerald R. Ford." In fact, the Navy's entire class of future carriers would be known as the Ford class--in honor of the President we praise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later this month, that accolade--which the Senate passed unanimously--is expected to come to fruition. Such a bestowal by Navy Secretary Winter would be an appropriate tribute to then-Lieutenant Ford, who, as a sailor in December 1944, encountered a typhoon while aboard the carrier USS Monterey and demonstrated the virtues that would emerge as the hallmark of his unflagging service and sacrifice to our Nation, such as calm and courage amid turmoil, presence of mind to act decisively  despite confusion and chaos, and an unflinching will of spirit to help others, even at great personal peril.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been recounted in the Bob Drury and Tom Clavin book "Halsey's Typhoon: The True Story of A Fighting Admiral, an Epic Storm, and an Untold Rescue" that Lieutenant Ford rescued wounded comrades, beat back raging fires, and helped salvage a ship that was ordered to be abandoned. Gerald Ford was integral to the effort driven by the simple belief of the skipper, Captain Ingersoll, that "we can fix this." As part of Admiral Halsey's Third Fleet, they did not give up the USS Monterey  in what reportedly was "one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. military history," a disaster where much of the fleet was decimated and more men were purportedly killed than in the Battle of Midway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this story in many ways embodies the essence of this great son of Michigan. The story of the USS Monterey is telling in that--like President Ford--it has for years taken a humble and unassuming place in the American narrative--and yet over time has rightfully grown in stature and acclaim. We also see a disposition and valor in a young sailor that would be brought to bear later in life as a statesman. Lieutenant Ford's reaction to conflagration and crisis was to take action  and help tamp it down. Gerald Ford helped bring under control the flames that imperiled the USS Monterey. He would do similarly as President when charged to guide the ship of state--which he did with a fearless, unflappable demeanor. And which he did, to paraphrase President</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with First Lady Betty Ford, their children, and the entire Ford family. May God bless and keep President Gerald R. Ford and may God bless the United States of America he so ably led.</paragraph>
