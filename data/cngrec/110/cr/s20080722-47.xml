  <narrative>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE (Junta's Anti-Democratic Efforts) Act of 2008".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Beginning on August 19, 2007, hundreds of thousands of citizens of Burma, including thousands of Buddhist monks and students, participated in peaceful demonstrations against rapidly deteriorating living conditions and the violent and repressive policies of the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), the ruling military regime in Burma--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) to demand the release of all political prisoners, including 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) to urge the regime to engage in meaningful dialogue to pursue national reconciliation.</narrative>
  <narrative> (2) The Burmese regime responded to these peaceful protests with a violent crackdown leading to the reported killing of approximately 200 people, including a Japanese photojournalist, and hundreds of injuries. Human rights groups further estimate that over 2,000 individuals have been detained, arrested, imprisoned, beaten, tortured, or otherwise intimidated as part of this crackdown. Burmese military, police, and their affiliates in the Union Solidarity Development Association (USDA) perpetrated  almost all of these abuses. The Burmese regime continues to detain, torture, and otherwise intimidate those individuals whom it believes participated in or led the protests and it has closed down or otherwise limited access to several monasteries and temples that played key roles in the peaceful protests.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) The Department of State's 2006 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices found that the SPDC--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) routinely restricts freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, religion, and movement;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) traffics in persons;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) discriminates against women and ethnic minorities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) forcibly recruits child soldiers and child labor; and &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) commits other serious violations of human rights, including extrajudicial killings, custodial deaths, disappearances, rape, torture, abuse of prisoners and detainees, and the imprisonment of citizens arbitrarily for political motives.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Aung San Suu Kyi has been arbitrarily imprisoned or held under house arrest for more than 12 years.</narrative>
  <narrative> (5) In October 2007, President Bush announced a new Executive Order to tighten economic sanctions against Burma and block property and travel to the United States by certain senior leaders of the SPDC, individuals who provide financial backing for the SPDC, and individuals responsible for human rights violations and impeding democracy in Burma. Additional names were added in updates done on October 19, 2007, and February 5, 2008. However, only 38 discrete individuals and 13 discrete companies  have been designated under those sanctions, once aliases and companies with similar names were removed. By contrast, the Australian Government identified more than 400 individuals and entities subject to its sanctions applied in the wake of the 2007 violence. The</narrative>
  <narrative> (7) In 2006, the Burmese regime earned more than $500 million from oil and gas projects, over $500 million from sale of hardwoods, and in excess of $300 million from the sale of rubies and jade. At least $500 million of the $2.16 billion earned in 2006 from Burma's two natural gas pipelines, one of which is 28 percent owned by a United States company, went to the Burmese regime. The regime has earned smaller amounts from oil and gas exploration and non-operational pipelines but United States  investors are not involved in those transactions. Industry sources estimate that over $100 million annually in Burmese rubies and jade enters the United States. Burma's official statistics report that Burma exported $500 million in hardwoods in 2006 but</narrative>

  <narrative> (3) work with project partners to ensure that forced labor is not used to construct, maintain, support, or defend the project facilities, including pipelines, offices, or other facilities.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative> Resolved further, That the House agree to the amendment of the Senate to the title of the aforesaid bill with the following:</narrative>
  <narrative>In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted by the amendment of the Senate to the title of the bill, amend the title so as to read: "An Act to impose sanctions on officials of the State Peace and Development Council in Burma, to amend the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 to exempt humanitarian assistance from United States sanctions on Burma, to prohibit the importation of gemstones from Burma, or that originate in Burma, to promote a coordinated international effort to restore civilian  democratic rule to Burma, and for other purposes.".</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to note Senate passage of <bill type="h" number="3890">H.R. 3890</bill>, the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE, Junta's Anti-Democratic Efforts, Act. This is bipartisan legislation that is now on its way to the President for his signature. In this effort, I was pleased to work closely again with my friend and colleague, Senator Biden of Delaware.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill--appropriately named in honor of Tom Lantos, a great champion of Burmese freedom and reconciliation--will further ratchet up the already strict sanctions against the State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, the grotesquely misnamed ruling junta. In doing so, it will restrict the importation of jade into the U.S. through other countries, one of the most lucrative sources of profit for the junta. It also enhances existing financial sanctions against the regime and includes new reporting  requirements which will provide greater transparency about the junta. These reports include data about the SPDC's financial holdings; information about countries that provide military assistance to the regime; and background on the Burmese timber trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would note that, like the annual Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, this legislation does not interrupt the flow of humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma, who continue to struggle in the wake of Cyclone Nargis. By focusing the sanctions on the SPDC, this bill sends a clear message to the junta that the United States stands squarely with the freedom-loving people of Burma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues can tell you, passing legislation sometimes means you don't get everything you want. I have been on record for over a decade as supporting the divestment of U.S. energy interests in Burma. I would have preferred it if Congress had taken binding action in this bill to compel divestment, but including such a provision would have threatened passage of this important legislation. Nonetheless, I would point out that Congress makes its position on the issue quite clear by encouraging  the voluntary divestment of all energy companies operating in Burma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would also like to express my appreciation for all those who have worked diligently on this legislation. In particular, I would like to thank Frank Jannuzi and Keith Luse of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff for their efforts.</paragraph>
