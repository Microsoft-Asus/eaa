    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, my colleagues, yes, we're looking at an anniversary of Iraq here. But let's talk about things that the American people can relate to immediately. Cost of eggs going up 35 percent in the last year, cost of milk going up about 23 percent, bread going up about 16 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we know that Americans going to the gas pump are paying near $4 a gallon in many areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What does this all have to do with Iraq?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, we're in Iraq for oil. The oil companies are running our domestic energy policy. It's having an impact on the price of food. It's causing a great transfer of wealth upwards away from the working people and the middle class of this country into the hands of a few wealthy oil company owners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to get out of Iraq. We need to end the occupation, close the bases, bring the troops home. We need to set in motion an international security and peacekeeping force that can stabilize Iraq as our troops leave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to start taking care of things here at home. Americans are losing their homes, they're losing their jobs, they're losing their health care, they're losing their retirement security. It's time we started to take care of things here at home and get out of Iraq.</paragraph>
