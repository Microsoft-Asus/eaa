  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>May 15, 2008. </narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR MAJORITY LEADER REID, SPEAKER PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER MCCONNELL AND MINORITY LEADER BOEHNER: As representatives of non-partisan organizations committed to improving health care for all children, we are writing to share our deep concern regarding the impact of the directive to states that was issued by the HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on August 17, 2007. In particular, we are concerned that scores of children who are currently enrolled in the State Children's  Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) will lose coverage as a result of this policy change. Unfortunately, the letter CMS sent to states on May 7, 2008, which seeks to clarify the directive's requirements, does not change the policy outlined in the August 17 directive and, sadly, does nothing to mitigate its impact. States still must overcome serious hurdles before</narrative>
  <narrative>As organizations committed to ensuring that all of our nation's children have access to affordable health care coverage, we strongly believe that no child in America  who is currently covered under SCHIP or Medicaid should lose their health coverage or access to care as a result of this administrative directive. We share your commitment to ensuring that federal health coverage programs make our nation's lowest income children the foremost priority, however,  the CMS directive runs directly contrary to our common goal of covering America's poorest children first. The August 17 directive already is jeopardizing access to health care for low-income children in at least 23 states. Moreover, recent reports by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Congressional Research Service (CRS) affirm that the directive goes beyond what is permissible under current</narrative>
  <narrative>With more than nine million American children lacking any form of health insurance and nearly two-thirds of that number already eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP, we must do all we can to reduce coverage barriers, not add additional ones. This directive already is having a chilling effect on states, stalling efforts in several states that were poised to enact policy changes to improve coverage of uninsured children. Halting the implementation of this directive is essential if we are to tackle the  coverage crisis facing our nation's most vulnerable children. No child in America should lose their health coverage as a result of philosophical differences in Washington, D.C. Our nation must do better for our children.</narrative>
  <narrative>We know you agree that our children are our nation's most precious resource and that investments in health care for kids reap benefits that last a lifetime. We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues with you and to work with you to be sure that all of our nation's children have access to the health care services and coverage they need.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
