    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Bishop for allowing me to bring up this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of establishing a tribute to Native Americans for their many contributions to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill, <bill type="hj" number="62">H.J. Res. 62</bill>, encourages all Americans to recognize the Friday after Thanksgiving as Native American Heritage Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman George Miller, Ranking Member DON YOUNG, Representatives DALE KILDEE and RUB&#xC9;N HINOJOSA for their continued support for this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since my time in the California legislature, I've been a strong advocate to help preserve the legacy of Native Americans. It's important that we recognize their contributions to all aspects of our society, from our government to our language to history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill encourages public elementary and secondary schools to enhance student understanding of Native Americans. We need more classroom instruction to focus on the history, culture and achievements and traditions of Native Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Native Americans and their ancestors have played a critical role in the establishment of the freest country in the world. They have fought with valor and have died in every American war dating back to the Revolutionary War to the current wars. We in Congress must encourage greater awareness of the significant roles they have played in our national history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I'm honored that Native Americans will be honored on this day.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Joint Resolution 62, to honor the achievements and contributions of Native Americans to the United States and for other purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The strength of our Nation comes from its people; and as the early inhabitants of this great land, the native peoples of North America played a unique role in shaping our Nation's history and culture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Native Americans are the descendants of the indigenous native people who were the original inhabitants and governors of the lands that now constitute the United States of America. It was their tribal governments that developed the fundamental principles of freedom of speech and separation of powers. They're a model for those that formed the foundation of the United States Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Founding Fathers based the provision of the Constitution on the unique system of democracy of the six nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. The Iroquois divided powers amongst the branches of government and provided for a system of checks and balances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Native Americans have made a distinct and significant contribution to the United States and to the rest of the world in many fields, including agriculture, medicine, music, language, art, among other things. And Native Americans have distinguished themselves, as my friend Mr. Baca has noted, as inventors, as entrepreneurs, as spiritual leaders and scholars, among a few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their unique spiritual, artistic and literary contributions, together with their vibrant customs and celebrations, enliven and enrich our land today. As we move into the 21st century, Native Americans will play a vital role in maintaining our Nation's strength and prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Almost half of America's Native American tribal leaders have served in the United States Armed Forces, following in the footsteps of their forebears, who distinguished themselves during the world wars and the conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Native Americans should be recognized for the contributions they have made to the fabric of our American society. This recognition will afford an opportunity for all Americans to demonstrate their respect and admiration of Native Americans for their important contributions to the political, the cultural, and the economic life of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The designation of Native American Heritage Day will encourage public elementary and secondary schools in the United States to enhance Americans by providing curricula and classroom instruction focusing on the achievements and contributions of Native Americans to the Nation, and the designation of the Friday following Thanksgiving of each year as Native American Heritage Day will underscore the government-to-government relationship between the United States of America and Native American governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this day we should call on all Americans to learn more about the history and the heritage of the native peoples of this great land. Such actions reaffirm our appreciation and most certainly our respect for their traditions and their way of life, and can help to preserve an important part of our culture for generations yet to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join my friend and colleague, Representative Baca, in supporting the resolution and ask my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
