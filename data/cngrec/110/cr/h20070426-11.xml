  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American public deserves to have all the facts about the Democrats' $3 trillion budget resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the surface, it looks great, more money for program after program, all the while balancing the budget. If it sounds too good to be true, it's because it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget funds a wish list of spending with so-called reserve funds. On paper, these reserve funds appear to designate funding for billions of dollars in Federal spending. But the fact is they are empty, little more than a clever gimmick to help balance the books, a shell game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to fund them, offsets would have to be found elsewhere or taxes would have to be raised. Since their plan doesn't include offsets, that leaves only one option, tax hikes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, the Democrats are asking Americans to tighten their belts so that Uncle Sam can loosen his. Congress has serious fiscal challenges to solve, but tax hikes and budget gimmicks are not the right answer.</paragraph>
