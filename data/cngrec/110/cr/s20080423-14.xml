  <narrative>FAIR PAY RESTORATION ACT -- (Senate - April 23, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3298">S3298</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I am deeply disappointed about the fact that we did not get the necessary votes to move the Fair Pay Restoration Act forward. We fell three votes short of what we needed to do to get the job done. This fight for equal pay for equal comparable work, however, will go on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the senior woman in the Senate, I take the floor tonight to say we will fight on. This was the first step forward. It will not be the only step we will take. But what we will not tolerate is another step backward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to continue to bring this fight. We will look for opportunities to bring this legislation back to the Senate floor. What is it we want to do? It is to end discrimination against women in their personal paychecks. In order to end that, we need to change the lawbooks so they can experience fairness in their personal checkbook.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the year 2008. You would think that in the year 2008, on the 40th anniversary of the passage of so many historic civil rights bills, we would finally have legislation that would guarantee fairness in terms of pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we regret we didn't get the votes, but we will move on. Many people have been mesmerized by the John Adams miniseries. I like John Adams, but I really liked Abigail. While John Adams was down in Philadelphia with Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and a bunch of the other guys writing the Declaration of Independence and laying the groundwork for the Constitution and inventing America, Abigail Adams wrote her husband from the farm--while raising the four children and keeping the family going.  She said: As you write those documents, do not forget the ladies, for we will foment a revolution of our own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand here today to say: Do not forget the ladies because we will foment a revolution of our own. I was here in 1992 when we didn't get it on Anita Hill. I am here in 2008 when we didn't get it in pay equity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1992, we had a revolution that went on. We got six new women in the Senate. There are now 16 of us. The majority of us voted for this bill. I am telling you we are ready for an "Abigail Adams" effort here. If they don't want to put us in the lawbooks so we can have fairness in the checkbooks, we will do a revolution. What do I mean by that? We will take it out to the voting booths. We will go on the Internet. We are going to go on TV, on the blogs. And we are going to tell everybody about  this ignominious vote that occurred. When we tell it, we are going to say: Call to arms, women of America, put your lipstick on, square your shoulders, suit up, we have a hell of a fight coming, but, boy, are we ready. The revolution starts tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
