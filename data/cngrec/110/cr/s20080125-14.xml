    <paragraph>Mr. President, I had earlier this morning intended to spend a few minutes talking about the stimulus package that was at least agreed to between the leadership of the other body and the administration, a matter that will be coming here and the Senate will have an opportunity to express its will on that matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I wanted to speak on it for a moment, at least as Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee that will have at least a small part of that discussion, because of the inclusion of the FHA proposals as well as the loan limits within the GSEs, which I commend the administration for including. These are critical elements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must, of course, deal with people's problems. But is something else again to deal with the problems that have caused people's problems. In my view, the deeper problem is the foreclosure crisis. That is the underlying issue, in my view, and therefore to have dealt with a short-term stimulus package that did not include some measures and steps that would address the housing issue and the foreclosure issue would have been shortsighted. So I was pleased to see that in addition with some rebates  and refundable tax assistance, even to those who have very limited incomes, as well as assistance to those with young children and families. All are wonderful ideas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know Senator Baucus, who will have the bulk of the responsibility in the Finance Committee for dealing with this, along with others who want to add elements of dealing with such things as unemployment insurance or food stamps or low-income energy assistance and the like, will have some additional thoughts on this short-term package. But I felt it was important to express some optimism about the direction it is going in and to note how important it is for consumers and investors to  begin to have their confidence restored.</paragraph>
