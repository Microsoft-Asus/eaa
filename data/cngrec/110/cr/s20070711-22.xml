    <paragraph>Madam President, I welcome this opportunity to extend my warmest congratulations to Nichole Bernier of Wellesley, MA, as she celebrates her fortieth birthday. Nichole is a truly remarkable woman--a distinguished author, a community leader, a wonderful wife to her husband Tom, and a magnificent mother to her children Connor, Hadley, and Declan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nichole has worked tirelessly for over a decade on a variety of charitable causes, including animal welfare, education, and cancer research. Through both her writing and her activism, Nichole has made an impressive difference in people's lives, especially those in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her service and dedication have meant a great deal to countless fellow citizens. It's a privilege to join her family and her many, many friends in congratulating her on this important milestone in her life, and I wish her many happy returns.</paragraph>
