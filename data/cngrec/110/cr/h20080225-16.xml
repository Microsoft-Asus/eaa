    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to ask the House to observe a moment of silence for the tragedy that beset Northern Illinois 11 days ago. On the afternoon of February 14, five bright, energetic young people, Gayle Dubowski, Juliana Gehant, Catalina Garcia, Ryanne Mace, and Daniel Parmenter, were killed and 16 others injured as a deranged gunman opened fire on students at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois, before committing suicide himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we grieve with our friends at NIU and millions around the world as we try to make sense of this unfathomable tragedy. Let us stand with and pray for the families of the victims and the 25,000 students who will have to deal with the aftermath of this senseless violence for years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know others in the Illinois delegation join me in this House in extending our condolences to all concerned and commend the brave and noble actions of our first responders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We respectfully ask for a moment of silence to be observed in this body.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Members will rise and observe a moment of silence.</chair>
