  <narrative>MESSAGE FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6455]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Myrick) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400288" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I bring a message from the American people. They don't like us. They viewed Congress as a body that's comprised of individuals that they elect and expect to reason together in the best interests of America and Americans. They don't see that happening. They insist they have had it with the politics itself and party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans are hurting because of fuel costs which are pushing up all other costs, including food. Winter is approaching, and the pain will grow much worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This crisis is seriously threatening our national security. We are sending more money to foreign nations than ever before, many of whom don't like us, to put it mildly. We, in government, refused to get our financial House in order. We are forcing our Nation to depend on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oh, and in an aside, emptying our Strategic Petroleum Reserve is not a solution. What if we are attacked, disaster? That's why reserves are called strategic. Politicians since, and including Jimmy Carter, have promised energy solutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, where are they? Under Carter we imported about 24 percent of our oil, and now we import about 70 percent. The American people are tired of hollow promises. They are demanding action now, now, not after the election, now. They demand plans for eliminating our dependence on oil, beginning with foreign oil, plans to use our own resource from offshore drilling to sugar cane conversion, all the while putting advanced batteries, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, wind, solar, hydrogen, nuclear and any  other realistic alternative on a critical fast track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, we must do everything we can to protect our environment if for no other reason than we all must breathe clean air, consume safe food and water, and, of course, protect God's creatures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people know it's their government, and they intend to take charge. Simply put, they are mad. Those before us, as well as many selfless heroes today, have and are now paying grievously. For this great opportunity that we call home, this America, the American people worked very hard to keep our Nation strong and productive. They do their jobs. The very least we can do as U.S. Congress is do our job.</paragraph>
