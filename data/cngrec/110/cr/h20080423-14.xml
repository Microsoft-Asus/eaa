    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this story comes from Kathryn French in my hometown of Louisville, Kentucky:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"John, I am a 51-year-old female. I was released from my third job in the past 9 years 8 months ago. I have a business degree from U of L. I have held management and sales positions for over 25 years, making about $50,000 a year. I also have a husband of 25 years who, thankfully, has always worked hard, and we are getting by, but we have a mortgage and two sons in college at U of L, not to mention telephone, cell phones, cable, heating, air conditioning, car payments, insurance, et cetera. I'm  not getting many interviews; too qualified, or too old. And it's hard to start over again. Then I hear Republicans say things like "if you extend unemployment then they won't look for a job." I already had to  cash out my 401(k)--and suffer a 10 percent penalty on top of taxes and losses in the stock market. If I'm having a hard time, what are others doing without the support I have from family and friends?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was Kathryn French, one voice from Kentucky's Third District.</paragraph>
