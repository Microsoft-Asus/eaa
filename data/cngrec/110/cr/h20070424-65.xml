  <speaking speaker="400051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to express my concern that Democrats will not extend tax relief measures critical to the American people. Residents in my State are at risk. Floridians currently have the ability to deduct their sales tax from their Federal tax returns. However, this deduction expires after 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Democrats set the agenda for the coming year, there is talk of offsetting increases in Federal spending by raising taxes for millions of Americans. Frankly, I worry that they will use this important provision to pay for additional spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Listen up America: Congress needs to make sure that taxpayers do not face unnecessary tax increases. I appeal to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that our constituents can keep more of their hard-earned money.</paragraph>
