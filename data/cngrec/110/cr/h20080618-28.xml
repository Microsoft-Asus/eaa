    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American people are rightfully concerned about the high cost of gas, and they are looking for solutions that will provide some immediate relief. We don't need more of the stale rhetoric of the past 7 years that we have heard from the Bush administration and their so-called energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush and congressional Republicans continue to argue that opening one of America's treasures, the Arctic refuge, to oil drilling will lower gas prices. That's simply not true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ask the experts. That is the conclusion of the Bush administration's own Energy Information Administration, which estimates that opening the Arctic refuge to drilling today will save only a few pennies a gallon 20 years from now. Sadly, this is the Republican solution to addressing the high prices that they created.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people are looking for action. That's exactly what this Democratic House has been doing over the past couple of months. Unfortunately, we need help from our friends across the aisle because President Bush remains committed to failed policies.</paragraph>
