  <speaking speaker="400660" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as the House continues its consideration of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill today, I urge all my colleagues to support funding for the Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though this amount is lower than the amount suggested by some of us in the 109th Congress, the $307 million in this appropriation bill will go to training and educating graduate medical students who will help our children at our children's hospitals across this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Especially close to my heart is my godson, Kyle, who at 18 months old was diagnosed with cancer and for the last 12 years has survived and has been helped and aided by these graduate medical students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I urge my colleagues, please support this bill. It is so critical to the health of our children.</paragraph>
