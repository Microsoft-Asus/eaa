    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Old Book says if you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I rise to pay a debt of gratitude and honor for a Hoosier lost in Operation Iraqi Freedom. I was deeply saddened to learn of the loss of Specialist Johnathan Lahmann of Richmond, Indiana, from wounds suffered in Bayji, Iraq on Monday when a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Lahmann served in the 59th Engineering Company, 20th Engineer Battalion, 36th Engineer Brigade, part of the Army III Corp based in Fort Hood, Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To be a U.S. Army soldier is to be a part of the strongest fighting force in the world. Specialist Lahmann embodied the American Army values of loyalty, duty, honor, respect, and selfless service. He continued that proud tradition as a combat engineer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Lahmann was also the recipient of the Expert Rifleman Badge and Army Good Conduct Medal. And he will be posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and a Purple Heart, having died in the line of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to express my profound condolences to his parents, Alan Lahmann and Linda Lahmann, to family, neighbors and friends for the loss of this brave young man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eastern Indiana will never forget the service and sacrifice of Johnathan Lahmann. His name will be enshrined in the hearts of two grateful nations.</paragraph>
