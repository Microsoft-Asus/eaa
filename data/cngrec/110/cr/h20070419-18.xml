    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, despite the best efforts of the abortion rights movement, 34 years since Roe v. Wade, more Americans embrace the sanctity of life than ever before. Yesterday, thanks to the leadership of the Republican Congress and this Republican President, the United States Supreme Court echoed that moral awakening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to commend the United States Supreme Court for affirming, in a 5-4 decision, the constitutionality of the ban of the barbaric procedure that has come to be known as partial birth abortion. I commend President Bush for signing the bill, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who supported it, and Congressman Steve Chabot of Ohio, its principal author.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Life is winning in America. In big cities and small towns, American women are listening and learning. It's not a choice; it's a baby. American women are choosing life as never before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To all who labor in the cause of life, I say in the wake of yesterday's decision, press on. Your labors on behalf of the unborn are not in vain.</paragraph>
