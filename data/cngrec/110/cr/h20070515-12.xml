    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it seems that President Bush and many of his allies still don't understand how things have changed on the ground in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few days ago the Republican leader, when asked about the President's new escalation plan, said that if it doesn't work, the President pretty soon is going to have to present to Congress and the American people what plan B is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, there are very few people that don't realize by now that we are not on plan B anymore; we are on plan Z. And we have got to start asking ourselves why plan A and plan B all the way through plan Z still haven't worked. It is because a military plan, without diplomatic and political reinforcements behind it, cannot work on the ground in Iraq. That is what the Democrats in Congress have realized. That is what the Iraq Study Group realized. That is what legions of retired generals have realized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is time the President and his allies join that hegemony of opinion and join us in setting a new course in Iraq.</paragraph>
