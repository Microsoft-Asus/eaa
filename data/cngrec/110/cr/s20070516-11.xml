    <paragraph>Mr. President, on April 13, 2007, my dear friend and colleague Senator TED STEVENS became the longest serving Republican Senator in the history of this body. Today, I would like to pay tribute to my friend and his more than 38 years of service to our Nation and the people of Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have known and worked with TED for over 34 years. We have served together on the Appropriations, Budget, and Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committees and many others. Ted and I have been in the Senate together for so long some of the committees on which we served no longer exist. We have collaborated on more pieces of legislation than I can remember and worked to resolve many issues. Most recently, I was thankful for his hard work in the effort to open the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge and increase the strategic security of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am happy to say TED has made the trip to New Mexico and I to Alaska so we could appreciate the needs of each other's home States. I have also had the pleasure of taking several trips with TED abroad, some more enjoyable than others. One that stands out in my mind is the fact-finding trip we took to North Korea several years ago to better understand the threat that nation poses to the world. I don't believe many people can say they have traveled there, even fewer can say they did  it with TED STEVENS. I am very thankful I can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is safe to say TED has had a remarkable life and career, born in Indianapolis, he has lived in California, Oregon, and Montana--finally settling in his beloved Alaska. During the Second World War, TED left college to join the Army Air Corps and became a decorated pilot. After the war TED attended Harvard Law School, became a U.S. Attorney, worked in the Department of the Interior, started his own law firm, and was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives.  For most individuals these accomplishments, all before he came to the Senate, would have marked a full and successful life. However, for TED it was just the beginning and I believe this Nation is lucky it was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After serving with TED for so many years I know of no one who cares more about the people of Alaska and this Nation or serves either with more dedication and distinction. I would like to personally thank TED for his friendship and hope to have the honor of serving alongside him for many years to come.</paragraph>
