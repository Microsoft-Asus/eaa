  <narrative>HEADING TOWARD A FISCAL TRAIN WRECK -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10439]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we come to the floor 9 months into the control of this House and this country by the Democratic majority, we have to ask ourselves, what has it brought? Well, it has brought us expanded government programs outside the area of jurisdiction, increase in Federal spending, and of course efforts to raise taxes on Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just at the very beginning of this year, it was the largest tax increase in U.S. history. A short time ago, it was a $53 billion increase through the SCHIP program. On spending, it was a $1 billion program just yesterday tried to do. And, of course, there is a litany of earmarks that we still don't know where it is going to and who is sponsoring it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was a Republican majority that forced the Democrats to give us a list of all the earmarks in their spending and have asked for more transparency. But I want to remind the American public, to this day we still do not have a list of all the earmarks, who is sponsoring them, and where the dollars are going to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage the Democrat majority to do as the American public must do, to live within their means, and to be open and honest as to where the American tax dollars are going to.</paragraph>
