  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>In the recent week, we watched in horror as terrorists, criminals, and people who are uncaring attacked the innocent people of Mumbai, India--a band of 10, attacking innocent persons in hotels, traveling to hospitals and to train stations, going to the Chabad religious community and killing recklessly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this should be a signal that we have to join together to again confront those who would terrorize the world. I know that this is going to be a place of conflict--Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India--but it is important for us to recognize that the people of India want peace, the people of Pakistan want peace, and the Bangladesh want peace, and the people in the Mid-East want peace. But we must weed out those who would terrorize us. We need to join together in the effort of stamping out  terrorism and meanwhile continue to secure the homeland.</paragraph>
