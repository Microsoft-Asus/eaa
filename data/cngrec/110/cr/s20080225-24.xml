  <narrative>RECOGNIZING THE LADY BULLDOGS -- (Senate - February 25, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1117">S1117</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President today I wish to honor the Madison High School gymnastics team for winning their 14th consecutive South Dakota State Gymnastics title and breaking the national record for most consecutive State gymnastics team titles. This is truly an impressive accomplishment, and I am proud to have such fine athletes representing the State of South Dakota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, the Madison High School Bulldogs were tied with Sehome High School from Bellingham, WA, for most consecutive championship wins. However, as a result of their countless hours of hard work and dedication, the Bulldogs have shown to the Nation their outstanding athletic talent and determination by winning the 2008 State Championship and clinching the national record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only did the Lady Bulldogs top the national record for most consecutive State wins, they also beat their State-best score from last year. Madison had four of the top scores in the vault, the top three in the balance beam, three of the top five in the uneven bars, and two of the top three in the floor exercise. This is evidence of the team's ability to perform well and work together in all of the categories of the championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Lady Bulldogs sealed their 14th win with a final score of 141.896 points. I would like to congratulate all the young women who have worked so hard this year to win the State championship. The gymnasts of the Lady Bulldogs for the 2007-2008 season, in alphabetical order, are as follows: Laura Blom, Danielle Bloom, Katie Breuer, Kassie Finck, Lexi Finck, Theresa Knapp, Katie Mackenzie, Heidi Mogck, Mara Riedel, Sara Rogers, Jessica Strom, Kaitlyn Walker, and Heather Williams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This remarkable accomplishment would not have been possible without the guidance and encouragement of the team's excellent coaching staff, head coach Maridee Dossett and assistant coach Kindra Wiese. Coach Dossett has been a Lady Bulldog since 1995, first as an athlete and now as a coach. She was part of the team when they won their first State title in 1995. Upon graduation, she has continued to contribute to the team and spur them on to continued success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bud Postma, the athletic director of the Lady Bulldogs, said the streak was a testament to past gymnasts and coaches at Madison. Linda Collignon was the coach who started the recordbreaking streak 14 years ago. This national record was made possible by the dedication of the gymnasts and coaching staff of the Madison High School gymnastics team throughout the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to acknowledge the support and devotion of the families of the Madison Gymnastics team members and the community of Madison. Without the encouragement and sacrifice from the gymnasts' families and the dedicated support of the Madison community, this amazing accomplishment would not have been possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the State of South Dakota, I am pleased to congratulate the Lady Bulldogs Gymnastics team on their recordbreaking national accomplishment and wish them the best of luck for their continued success.</paragraph>
