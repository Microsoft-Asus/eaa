    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, while the President continues to resist any changes to his failed policy in Iraq, the situation is getting worse, it's getting worse for our troops. American casualties are up 53 percent this year over the same period last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the escalating civil war, last week Pentagon officials told 35,000 more American troops that they will be sent to Iraq. Earlier this year, the President said the surge would last a couple of months, but now the administration is planning to stretch the plan out for 18 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is increasingly clear that the President's plan to escalate the war in Iraq is not working. The American people overwhelmingly favor a new direction in Iraq and a plan to hold the Iraqi Government accountable for their own nation and their own security, but for some reason Republicans continue to stall, unwilling to break away from President Bush and ignoring all the bad news on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, after 4 years of failed policies, we do not need to give the President a blank check.</paragraph>
