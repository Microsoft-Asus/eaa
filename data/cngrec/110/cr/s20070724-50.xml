    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution commemorating the 125th anniversary of the 1882 Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce, and Navigation between the Kingdom of Chosun, Korea, and the United States Treaty provisions covered the appointment of diplomatic and consular representatives, care for U.S. ships in distress or needing fuel, and protection for American citizens. The treaty also allowed that Koreans could work in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As President Reagan noted on the 100th anniversary of the treaty signing, "This Treaty marked a chapter in the history of northeast Asia and was the auspicious beginning of an enduring partnership between the United States and Korea."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Initial efforts in 1880 by U.S. Commodore Robert W. Shufeldt to negotiate a treaty of friendship and commerce with Korea were unsuccessful. However, in an interesting similarity to current events, Chinese officials assisted in this endeavor. Viceroy Li Hongzhang, a leading Chinese figure, invited Commodore Shufeldt to visit China so that discussions could be held regarding the U.S. efforts for a treaty with Korea. In May of 1882, in part due to Chinese assistance, agreement was reached. Commodore  Shufeldt and Minister Sin Hon among others, participated in the treaty ceremony in Inchon. After it arrived in the United States, the treaty was ratified the following January.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republic of Korea-United States partnership covers economic, educational, security, and other fronts. Nearly 40,000 American citizens gave their lives during the Korean War with the hope that the Republic of Korea would remain free and independent. The U.S. Department of Defense reports that over 8,000 American personnel remain missing from their service in that war, with nearly 200 of those from my home State of Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, approximately 2 million Korean-Americans contribute to the fabric of life in the United States, and serve as an important link, on a personal basis, with the Republic of Korea. I am pleased to introduce this resolution with deep appreciation for this important bilateral relationship.</paragraph>
