  <speaking speaker="300010" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, in April, TED STEVENS became the longest serving Republican Member of the United States Senate in our country's 230-year history. I join my colleagues in congratulating the Senator and thanking him for his many years of service and our friendship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much has already been said about Senator STEVENS' sometimes grouchy and intimidating demeanor. But if we look past the hulk ties, the scowling countenance, the vigorous defense of any and all attacks on Alaskan priorities, and the cowed staff who fear that they have fallen on the wrong side of our esteemed senior Senator, we see another, more compassionate side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I first arrived in Washington, DC, in 1987, my son was entering first grade at the same time as Ted's beloved daughter. Sam and Lily became fast friends, and so did their parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ted and Catherine were very close friends of ours and like godparents to Sam. Anyone who knows Ted well  knows how important his family is and the high value he places on his children and their friends. He is truly a most kind, gentle, and readily approachable father, uncle, and godfather.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His concern about others' children and family members is equally heartfelt. As he exercises his many leadership roles, Senator STEVENS is always willing to take our family obligations into account. He realizes how important it is to schedule time for our families in the chaotic, hectic life we lead in the United States Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the close personal friendship we have enjoyed with the Stevens family, I have had the opportunity to work closely with Chairman STEVENS as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman, Ted is solicitous of the concerns of even his most junior members. He is also a devoted friend of his partner--sometimes ranking member and sometimes chairman--Senator DAN INOUYE.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there is never any doubt that he and Senator INOUYE control the Defense Appropriations call, Senator STEVENS is sensitive and receptive to the needs of other Members to the greatest extent possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is a very passionate defender of the Appropriations Committee, its prerogatives, and its responsibilities. Woe unto the person who attacks the appropriations process or the work that he does. One soon learns that such a position is not one to be taken lightly. One had better be prepared for a bruising fight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As President pro tempore, he was a faithful and dedicated leader of the Senate. Now that he is--temporarily--out of that position, he continues a close working relationship with his good friend and colleague Senator ROBERT C. BYRD, the current President pro tem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is, indeed, an honor to have him as our leading senior Republican in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator's influence extends far beyond the Senate to Alaska, the Nation and the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the accomplishments of the Senate over the last 4 decades bear the mark of TED STEVENS. He has been tireless in his leadership to secure a strong military--and has funded a strong personnel system, the most needed, up-to-date equipment and the most promising research. The current strength and superiority of the U.S. Armed Forces is due in no small part to Senator STEVENS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has also been a leader in the natural resources, transportation issues, and climate change issues important to all of America but that particularly affect his home state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ted is passionate about Alaska--its natural beauty, its people, its needs and its fishing. Many of us have enjoyed traveling to Alaska with Senator Stevens and discovering first-hand the treasures it has to offer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The many roads, parks and buildings named for him are but a hint of all he has done for the State. His contributions are extensive and lasting, from improving the infrastructure to safeguarding the wildlife and natural resources Alaska has in abundance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alaskans rightly dubbed the Senator the "Alaska of the Twentieth Century." I am sure Senator Stevens would remind us that he is not done yet. Odds are he is a favorite to be "Alaskan of the Twenty-first Century" as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been a tremendous honor and privilege to serve with TED STEVENS. I look forward to many more years of working together.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to acknowledge an esteemed colleague and his long and storied service to the United States Senate. Senator Ted Stevens has given much to this great country of ours. Born in Indiana, he spent his college years in the West, his law school years in the East, and made significant contributions in a place far north of here. Yet he achieved much of this by heading south, to our Nation's Capital. His career reflects his dedication not only to Alaska but  to all of America. He has touched every corner of this country--and beyond. Fighting in China during World War II, he served our Nation valiantly as a member of the Army Air Corps where he flew support missions for the Flying Tigers of the 14th Air Force. Now, more than six decades later, he is still serving our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following work as an attorney in Alaska in the 1950s, Ted Stevens headed for Washington to work for the Department of Interior under the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It is worth noting that it was President Eisenhower who signed Alaska into statehood in July of 1958. Not too long after Alaska found statehood, he decided to return to the home he had made in the Last Frontier. Soon, he was serving in the State house of representatives--a body of which he became the  majority leader in 1964. While he may have initially found his way to the U.S. Senate by virtue of appointment in 1968, he soon had the weight of his State's voters behind him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now serving his seventh term in office, Senator Stevens has been a reliable supporter of his home State's interests and has supported our country in many of its most trying times. The institutional knowledge and wisdom which Senator Stevens brings to the Senate benefits this body greatly. All of us appreciate his work and contributions to America. Be it as the former chairman of the Commerce Committee, the former chairman of the Appropriations Committee, a strong voice and dedicated  member of the Homeland Security Committeeor for his work on the Rules Committee--we thank him for his leadership, past and present.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations to Senator Stevens on becoming the longest serving Republican in Senate history. His more than 14,000 days in this body are a remarkable testament to his hard work, staying power, and skills as a Senator. I know the people of Alaska appreciate all that he has done for them over these numerous decades. On behalf of my fellow Floridians, I thank Senator Stevens for his service to America and to the Senate.</paragraph>
