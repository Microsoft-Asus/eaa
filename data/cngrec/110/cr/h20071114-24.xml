  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, by every measure the war in Iraq has cost Americans far too much, whether it's lives lost, dollars spent, or our reputation tarnished around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Democrats plan to send the President a smaller war funding bill than the one he requested but one with a bigger message: Start bringing our troops home now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without a change in course, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that Federal spending on the war could reach $2.4 trillion by 2017. A new report from the Joint Economic Committee finds that when you add in the "hidden costs" of the war, such as higher oil prices, interest payments, and helping to take care of our wounded veterans, the total economic costs will rise by over $1 trillion to $3.5 trillion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time for a new direction in Iraq.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
