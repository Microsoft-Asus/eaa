  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the supplemental bill is dangerous for our troops and dangerous for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Defense Secretary Robert Gates restated yesterday to the bipartisan Army Caucus that timetables will stop the military from completing its mission. The Washington Post has criticized the proposal, saying it could lead to massive civilian casualties, to al Qaeda establishing bases to attack America and our allies, and to a regional war of disastrous consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al Qaeda spokesman Zawahiri has identified Iraq and Afghanistan as the central fronts in the global war on terrorism. Bin Laden has specifically referred to Iraq as the "Third World War."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a 31-year veteran with four sons in the military, including one Iraq veteran, I understand the importance of supporting our troops in combat. I hope my colleagues of both parties will join me to support former Vietnam POW SAM JOHNSON'S bill to fully support and fund our men and women in uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11</paragraph>
  </speaking>
