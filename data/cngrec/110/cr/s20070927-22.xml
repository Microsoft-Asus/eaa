    <paragraph>Mr. President, this week marks the 50th anniversary of the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School, a victory for equality in education that was only secured with the help of Federal troops. The images that came out of Little Rock in September 1953 remain indelible: the National Guard literally standing in the way of equal education; a citizens' blockade threatening to break into mob violence at the mere thought of sharing their school with Black students; and the quiet dignity  and courage of the Little Rock Nine. Their determination to claim their rights is still a source of inspiration, but the rest of the Little Rock crisis is a source of shame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we do two things on this 50th anniversary. First and foremost, we honor the nine young students who integrated Little Rock and who gave eloquent testimony that equality begins with education. We thank them today: Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Jefferson Thomas, Terrence Roberts, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Minnijean Brown, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed, and Melba Pattillo Beals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But second, we need to forthrightly face the truth this week: 50 years later and 53 years after Brown v. Board of Education, the work they helped begin is still incomplete. Segregation in law is over, but who can doubt that it persists in fact? National Guard troops may no longer be blocking children from the door to an equal eduation, but the forces that have taken their place, if less visible, are no less potent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether an American child has good teachers, whether that child has up-to-date textbooks, whether that child goes to school in a safe, modern building--all of these educational essentials depdend far too much on where that child happens to live. In fact, America--the country that struck down segregation more than a half-century ago--ranks at the bottom of developed countries in the disparity of schooling it offers to the rich and the poor. Why doesn't that gap shame us just as much as anything  that happened in Little Rock?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, a textbook published in this millenium should not be a luxury. Modern school buildings and computers and libraries should not be luxuries. Qualified teachers, competent guidance counselors, rigorous curricula, small classes--they should not  be luxuries. Children should not be entitled to them because they happen to live in affluence; they are entitled to them because they live in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us look to this important anniversary for inspiration to desegregate American education for good and for all--to complete the work begun so bravely by the Little Rock Nine.</paragraph>
