  <speaking speaker="400440" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker and my fellow colleagues, today is the day with General Petraeus to recognize that with all the rhetoric on this floor, that we should listen to the troops. They are the ones that are sacrificing. They are the ones that I believe have firsthand knowledge of what is occurring in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a letter that I am going to read:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear Congressman Young:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am an Alaska Army National Guard soldier serving in Iraq voluntarily on one of the 10 `surge' Embedded Provincial Reconstruction Teams, based at Camp Taji. My team works in the Taji and Abu Ghraib districts, and soon, Tarmiya. Our surge military forces, along with the greatly improved Iraq Army, Police and local Critical Infrastructure Security Forces have won the battles. Al Qaeda is gone from our districts. Now we need the time to win the war. The security situations are set and 180 degrees  turned around from pre-surge. I've seen it happen and am living it daily. Do not let the United States lose this part of the Global War against Terrorists. This campaign in Iraq needs to play out and be a visible win for our country. Me and my fellow Servicemembers and the Civilians of DOD and State are here to make it true. We need your support. Thank you for your time and attention. WE ARE WINNING.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mike Bridges, Colonel,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deputy Team Leader, EPRT Baghdad 5.</paragraph>
