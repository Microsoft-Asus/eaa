    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to thank the majority leader for his cooperation on an issue regarding an amendment that I had on the continuing resolution relative to the SCHIP problem that exists not just in my State of Georgia, but in 13 States where we have a shortfall in Federal funding that is going to require, if we don't take action, a number of children all across America to be removed from the SCHIP rolls, and their health insurance will be terminated. The majority leader has agreed  that during the break we are going to work among our staffs--Senator Isakson and I have been in conversation with his staff already--and we are going to continue to work with him, as well as with others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a problem unique to Georgia. We are going to seek to come to a compromise on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In about 10 days to 2 weeks or so, we will have a cure or a fix for this problem that exists out there regarding the shortfall on SCHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Senator Reid, I say thank you for his cooperation on this and his commitment to working together with us to find a solution for the children all across America to make sure these children do remain insured. I say to my colleague from Georgia, Senator Isakson, thanks for his hard work and commitment on this issue as we have worked very closely together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
