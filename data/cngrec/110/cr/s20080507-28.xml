    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I celebrate the outstanding achievements of two brothers from Portland, ME, who recently won the U.S. Small Business Administration's Young Entrepreneurs of the Year Award on the local, regional, and national levels. John and Brendan Ready are the founders and owners of Ready Seafood and Catch a Piece of Maine, two highly successful firms that have transformed the Maine lobster market. I had the pleasure of meeting with the brothers just 2 weeks ago, and they  are a true reflection of the dedication and zeal of Maine's legendary lobstermen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ready brothers grew up in Cape Elizabeth, on Maine's picturesque coast, where they quickly grew fond of the sea. Venturing out with their uncle to catch lobsters, the pair learned the intricacies of the trade before their teenage years, and they continued to fish throughout high school. Attentive to their lifelong passion for lobstering, the brothers returned from college during summer breaks and even weekends to lobster. Additionally, John spent an extra year at Boston University to participate  as a lobsterman in a co-op program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When they arrived back in Maine following college--John from Boston University and Brendan from Stonehill College--the duo immediately sought to enter the Maine seafood market. In 2004, they opened Ready Seafood, a thriving wholesaler of fresh lobster and other seafood to domestic clients, as well as customers as far away as Italy, China, and Japan. To promote Maine's rich history of lobstering, the firm provides both internships and unique educational opportunities to high school and college  students in the region, including an inside look at how Portland's waterfront works. The brothers have visibly transformed the company into a $10 million business in just 4 short years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In October 2007, seeking to create a one of its kind company in the crowded seafood industry, the Ready brothers launched Catch a Piece of Maine, a remarkable and innovative company that allows individuals and corporate clients alike to purchase lobsters caught especially for them. The buyers pay an annual fee, which entitles them to have their own personal lobsterman set their traps and collect their lobsters. The company began with 400 traps for 2008, all of which were in place by last Thursday,  and each is guaranteed to garner a minimum of 40 lobsters throughout the remainder of the year. The lobsters are shipped at intervals scheduled by the client, and each shipment includes one pound of mussels and clams, a Maine dessert, and the traditional bibs and utensils essential to enjoying Maine's famed crustacean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The program includes some additional distinctive features. Customers keep in touch with their personal lobstermen through the Internet by logging onto an individualized and regularly updated summary, including how many lobsters have been caught and when the traps were checked. Moreover, clients can have their lobsters shipped anywhere in the continental United States, making a great holiday gift, corporate thank you, or special anniversary dinner. Ever mindful of the future of Maine's gorgeous  coast and those who rely on it, the Ready brothers send 10 percent of their profits to the Gulf of Maine Research Institute for marine ecosystem education programs for schoolchildren throughout the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fundamentally forthright business philosophy of the Ready brothers is truly impressive. They represent the next generation of Maine lobstermen, and as such they continue and share the heritage of the State's prized tradition. Through both Ready Seafood and Catch a Piece of Maine, the brothers have already taken great steps to doing just that. I commend both Brendan and John for their originality and dedication--and for garnering the U.S. Small Business Administration's Young Entrepreneurs  of the Year Award--and wish them well in their extremely bright futures.</paragraph>
