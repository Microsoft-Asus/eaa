    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have not been able to clear the Wounded Warrior legislation. It is my understanding the minority is looking at that again tonight. Hopefully, we can get it done tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I come in in the morning, when the Senate convenes, I am going to ask consent again to pass that. This is one of the opportunities we have to really do something for the troops. The Defense authorization bill, the other stuff in it, doesn't become effective until the beginning of the fiscal year, October 1, but this, Wounded Warrior, becomes effective upon passage and approval, so it would really be good if we could do that sooner rather than later. As soon as we complete it here, we will  be that much closer to being able to get that to the President. The House can do it very quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was meeting with the Speaker this afternoon. It is amazing what they can do in just a short period of time. I went over my list of things I wanted to complete for the Senate this next couple of weeks: This appropriations bill we are working on now, SCHIP, the conference report on ethics, and then the one on &#xD0;9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She had two pages of things they were going to do in the next couple of weeks. We can't do that here but she can. That is when you realize the difference between the House and the Senate.</paragraph>
