    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to inform my colleagues that for the second consecutive year, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters of Waterbury, VT, has been named the top overall firm on Corporate Responsibility Officers Magazine's annual list of 100 Best Corporate Citizens. This is the first time any company has been awarded this prestigious title 2 years in a row.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Green Mountain Coffee's award is rooted in the leading role the company plays in the specialty coffee and fair trade industries. By constantly striving to lead the company to exemplary corporate citizenship, Bob Stiller, Green Mountain Coffee's president and CEO, has molded the company into a socially responsible and environmentally conscious business that makes Vermonters proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Bob and all of the employees at Green Mountain Coffee for this well-deserved recognition. Mr. President, they make great coffee, they do business well, and they do great business--and these accomplishments, I believe, are related. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the following article from the Rutland Herald be printed in the RECORD so that all Senators can read about the success and admirable business practices of this visionary company.</paragraph>
