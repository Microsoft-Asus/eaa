    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of <bill type="s" number="2478">S. 2478</bill> which names a postal facility in the town of East Hampstead, New Hampshire, after Captain Jonathan D. Grassbaugh.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2478">S. 2478</bill>, which was introduced in the Senate by Senator John Sununu on December 13, 2007, and passed by the Chamber under unanimous consent on December 19, 2007, has been considered and reported out of the Oversight Committee by voice vote as of January 29, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many of the postal naming measures in which this body has previously considered and passed over the past couple of years, <bill type="s" number="2478">S. 2478</bill> seeks to honor the service and dedication of a heroic American serviceman, the Honorable Captain Jonathan D. Grassbaugh, by naming after him the post office in his hometown of East Hampstead, New Hampshire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born and raised in the fine city of East Hampstead, New Hampshire, Captain Grassbaugh is held in high esteem by friends and family alike who recall him as an exceptional student and active community volunteer. After graduating from high school with honors, Captain Grassbaugh attended Johns Hopkins University where he graduated in 2003 with a bachelor's degree in computer science. During his collegiate pursuits at Johns Hopkins, Captain Grassbaugh also served as the battalion commander for  the school's ROTC program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After completing U.S. Army Ranger School in April 2004, Captain Grassbaugh was assigned to the 5th Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Sadly, however, on April 7, 2007, while serving in Iraq, Captain Jonathan Grassbaugh was tragically killed when an improvised explosive device detonated near his unit in Zaganiyah, Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, given Captain Grassbaugh's commitment to his community, his vocation and, of course, his country, I think it only fitting that we pass the underlying measure to designate the post office on Colby Corner in East Hampstead, New Hampshire, as the Captain Jonathan D. Grassbaugh Post Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to urge passage of this bill designating the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 59 Colby Corner in East Hampstead, New Hampshire, as the Captain Jonathan D. Grassbaugh Post Office. Described by his family as "the epitome of an officer and a gentleman," Captain Jonathan Grassbaugh was a truly remarkable young man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born into a military family, Captain Grassbaugh moved to New Hampshire at the age of 3. After graduating from Phillips Exeter Academy, he attended Johns Hopkins University where he earned his degree in computer science. During his time at Hopkins, Jonathan rose quickly through the ranks of his Army ROTC class, selected as the cadet battalion commander his senior year. Jonathan's dedication and sense of honor served as a driving force behind the JHU Ranger Challenge team winning brigade competitions  2 years in a row and the battalion being rated third in the nation among 270 ROTC units.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the words of one of his professors, "In my 9 years of teaching ROTC, Jonathan Grassbaugh was by far one of the most energetic and conscientious young men that I have ever had the honor to teach."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005 during his first tour in Iraq, Captain Grassbaugh served as aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Michael Ferriter, a top adviser to the U.S. military commander in Iraq. Speaking at Jonathan's funeral, Ferriter commented on the young man he grew to know so well: "He made me a better leader and a better man. He was simply as good as it gets. He was the best; a warrior, friend, comrade, loving husband, and caring son."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In June of 2006, Jonathan married his college sweetheart, Jenna, just a few  days after her graduation from Hopkins. A few weeks later he was deployed to Iraq as a member of the 73rd Cavalry, 5th Brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division. On April 7, 2007, the 25-year-old Grassbaugh was killed by an IED while conducting a combat logistic patrol in Zaganiyah, Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A loving husband, dedicated son, and accomplished soldier, Captain Grassbaugh was and will remain a shining example of America's best. Though we will never have the privilege of knowing the limits of his seemingly endless potential, the memory of his spirit, honor, and dedication should live on as an example to others. In the words of the Reverend Frederick Pennett at his funeral, "He laid down his life for us and for his country. There is no greater love than this. Jonathan's story and his  memory will go on forever."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge that we help preserve the memory of Captain Jonathan Grassbaugh with passage of this bill, and I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this fitting tribute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she might consume to Representative Carol Shea-Porter from New Hampshire.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bill and in honor of a great son of New Hampshire, Captain Jonathan Grassbaugh. I would like to thank my colleagues in the House for bringing this to the floor and my colleagues in the Senate for passing the original version.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is a special privilege for me to offer my remarks in support of this legislation and to have an opportunity to share with my colleagues in the House the story of an outstanding young man, a courageous leader, and a brave husband.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jon was born on August 18, 1981. He and his family moved to Hampstead, New Hampshire, 8 years later and quickly grew roots in their community. His mother, Patricia, is the principal at Hampstead Middle School. Jon attended the elite Phillips Exeter Academy and graduated with honors in 1999. He attended Johns Hopkins University where he was commissioned through their ROTC program and graduated in 2003. That's also where Jon met his wife, Jenna, an Army officer in her own right. Tragically, they  had only been married 10 months when an IED took Jon and three of his fellow Rangers on a combat logistics patrol in Diyala province.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Jon finished school, he continued a strong family tradition of service to our country. His father was also a Ranger who served in Vietnam. Jon's brother is a West Point and Dartmouth graduate and an Army surgeon at Fort Lewis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For Jon, it was not enough to serve. He excelled, the best of the best. A highly decorated officer, Jon was assigned to 5th Squad, 73rd Cavalry, 3rd BCT of the 82nd Airborne, Fort Bragg. As I said, the best of the best. Among more than a dozen of Jon's medals and honors are the Bronze Star he earned for combat heroism and a Purple Heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jon was killed in action on April 7, 2007. He was only 25 years old. Our thoughts and prayers remain with his wife, Jenna. Jon was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery alongside three centuries of America's heroes, hallowed ground befitting a hero. We in New Hampshire are lucky to have had time with him and we have been blessed by the life of this wonderful man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me today in continuing to honor his life by voting to memorialize his service, his dedication to his country and to his family, and his willingness to give his country his own life. Join me in passing <bill type="s" number="2478">S. 2478</bill> for Army Ranger Captain Jonathan D. Grassbaugh.</paragraph>
