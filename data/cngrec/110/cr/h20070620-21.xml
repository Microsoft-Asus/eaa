    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during the first months of this new Congress, Democrats have passed resolutions congratulating sports teams and renaming post offices, along with the largest tax increase in American history. But they've done nothing to lower the tax burden on hardworking American families, enact legislation to address skyrocketing gasoline prices, or enact legislation to secure our borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know what my district needs. Families in my district want a lower tax bill. They want us to spend their tax dollars sparingly and wisely. My constituents want to pay less for gas at  the pump. They want to know our borders are secure, and that our ports and airports are safe from terrorists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time for this Congress to start addressing the priorities of the American public. It's time we stopped passing resolutions congratulating sports teams and started enacting legislation into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my Democrat colleagues not to continue to languish as a do-nothing Congress, but to let us start enacting some of the legislative priorities of our constituents into law.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
