  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have repeatedly come to the floor to speak about one of the worst human tragedies in recent memory--the crisis in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 4 long years the world has watched this tragedy. We have witnessed the killing of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians, the torching of entire villages, rape, torture, and untold human suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us on both sides of the aisle and in the international community have repeatedly called for greater U.S. and global action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon taking office in January of this year, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said that ending the violence in Darfur was going to be one of his top priorities. President Bush has rightly called the situation in Darfur genocide. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said that, "Darfur is the greatest humanitarian crisis the world faces today."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I speak once again about this crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Quite simply, we are at a critical juncture in Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The situation in Darfur has become increasingly complex. Rebel groups are jockeying for power and fighting amongst themselves. Banditry and lawlessness are on the rise and humanitarian workers remain at great risk. In late September, a rebel group brutally killed ten African Union peacekeepers in a surprise raid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last week, reports surfaced of a new, appallingly violent massacre in southern Darfur. According to reports, more than 30 civilians were killed, including a young boy who was shot in the back while trying to run away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And now the peace agreement between North and South Sudan--a U.S. brokered accord that might have formed a blueprint for a political settlement in Darfur--appears increasingly in jeopardy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, without action, Sudan may be on the verge of even greater instability and human misery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet thanks in part to the tireless work of Secretary General Ban, we also have two critical opportunities to bring about a long-term resolution to this crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, in late July the U.N. Security Council voted to implement a significantly increased U.N./African Union peacekeeping force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This peacekeeping force is desperately needed and the United States should work with the U.N. and the global community to make sure it is deployed as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the White House for including funding for this urgent mission in its supplemental appropriations request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the peacekeepers are only one important step. Sudan also needs a long-term political agreement. As Secretary General Ban said recently in Sudan, "There must be a peace to keep."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This weekend in Tripoli, a first round of peace talks between the various factions and the Sudanese government will begin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The peacekeeping forces and the Tripoli negotiations are two critical steps toward ending the violence, and they deserve our strongest support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must make it clear that we expect all factions to stop the violence and participate in good faith in the peace talks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must demand that China and Russia immediately halt the sale of weapons in Sudan. That's right, two permanent members of the U.N. Security Council are the primary arms suppliers in Sudan. Global leaders have a responsibility to halt such sales.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But ultimately, we must hold the Sudanese government accountable. Its culpability in the years of violence and stonewalling of international efforts is well known.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sudanese President Bashir must be held to his commitment to allow peacekeepers in the country and to participate in the peace talks. He must also work to ensure the North-South peace agreement does not collapse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early statements by his government said that it would "contribute positively to secure the environment for the negotiations" and "facilitate the timely deployment" of the 26,000 member peacekeeping force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, we have every reason to be skeptical of the regime's intentions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is therefore critical that we maintain pressure on the Sudanese government to honor its commitments. The administration should continue its diplomatic efforts and we in Congress should consider tightening economic sanctions if the Sudanese government does not cooperate with the peacekeepers or the upcoming peace negotiations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The stakes are too high, and the humanitarian crisis has dragged on too long to allow any more delay in Sudan.</paragraph>
