  <speaking speaker="400621" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, over the course of this Nation's history, generations of Americans have made tremendous sacrifices to protect the freedoms we hold dear. Every May, we honor these courageous Americans on Armed Forces Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just a few years after the close of World War II, President Harry S. Truman led the effort for this holiday. It was at the end of August, 1949, that Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson announced the creation of Armed Forces Day to replace separate days of celebration for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a day for all of us as Americans to come together to recognize our brave military men and women for their service, sacrifice, and dedication to our Nation. On this Armed Forces Day, we are reminded of the important contributions our service men and women are currently making overseas to help others come to know the freedom we enjoy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us not only remember all of the service men and women who have served our country so bravely, let us appreciate those serving at home and their families who sacrifice so much. On this day we thank members of our military for their selfless dedication to working everyday to protect our liberty and freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the home to more than 20 military installations and nearly 2 million veterans, this past Saturday was a proud day for many Floridians. I salute all those who have given up so much for our Nation, and express my tremendous gratitude for their service.</paragraph>
