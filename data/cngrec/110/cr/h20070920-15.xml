    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the recent trip by Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev to India to highlight the growing relationship between these two democracies. As cochair of both the Bulgaria Caucus and the Caucus on India and Indian Americans, I am encouraged by this good news.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This visit marks a continuation of the economic relationship both nations have fostered by expanding their trade and investment opportunities. America will be a key ally of Bulgaria and India in providing growth for their partnership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of NATO and the European Union, Bulgaria is a friend of the United States. We are in a unique position to strengthen their relationship with our allies throughout the world. Additionally, India remains one of our strategic partners in Asia under the leadership of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. I am pleased that the United States and India are finalizing the civilian nuclear agreement that will expand the use of a clean energy source for India and fulfill our nonproliferation efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
