    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to Representative Foster from the State of Illinois.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412257" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5235">H.R. 5235</bill>, the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is especially significant for myself and for my constituents, because Ronald Reagan was a native son of my district. Born in Tampico, Illinois, and raised in Dixon, Ronald Reagan spent his life upholding the strong values of small-town America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whatever your political philosophy, there is no doubt that Ronald Reagan left an indelible imprint on the fabric of America. The Great Communicator, he had an emotional connection with the American people that was sustained through good times and bad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a physicist, I want to pay particular tribute to President Reagan's rock-solid belief that the world should be rid of nuclear weapons. That moment in Reykjavik, in 1986, when Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan reached an agreement in principle to rid the world of nuclear weapons, is a moment and an opportunity that we should not have let slip between our fingers, and we should grasp and seize in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we all recognize that we live in a dangerous world, nonetheless, nuclear disarmament is an aspirational goal that world leaders should strive to achieve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to take this time to commend Nancy Reagan for her strength during her husband's illness and her steadfast devotion to President Reagan during his last days. Her work since his death has been essential in preserving his legacy, and we should pass this bill to honor her efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, if passed, would establish the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission in order to honor the 100th anniversary of Reagan's birth with activities, a postal stamp and a $1 coin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my fellow representatives to vote in favor of this bill so that we may properly celebrate the life, legacy, and hometown of this consequential President. He was loved by his country and he is deserving of this honor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would yield to the author of this resolution, Mr. Gallegly, the gentleman from California, as much time as he may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. GALLEGLY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400144" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="5235">H.R. 5235</bill>, the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>To prepare for the upcoming anniversary of his 100th birthday on February 6, 2011, Mr. Blunt and I, along with 160 cosponsors from both parties, introduced this legislation creating the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission to pay tribute to our 40th President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This 11-member bipartisan commission is similar to the others created for Presidents Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower. This commission will develop plans and memorials to honor President Ronald Reagan. These events will take place all over the country, from here in Washington, DC to his birthplace in Illinois, to California, where he lived most of his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a fellow Californian, I had the great pleasure of spending time with him when I first came to the House of Representatives in 1986. And as a matter of fact, his Presidential Library and burial place is only a few blocks from my own home in Simi Valley, California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The Great Communicator" spoke for the American people, capturing the hearts of small-town citizens and world leaders alike. His remarkable career and public life spanned over 50 years. It began as a student leader, sports broadcaster in Illinois and Iowa, then to Hollywood as an actor and long-time president of the Screen Actors Guild.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>California enjoyed an economic resurgence during his terms as Governor, and as President of the United States, his legacy is extraordinary. In 8 short years as President, Ronald Reagan presided over international changes and ushered in unparalleled peace and prosperity, not only for our Nation, but for the entire world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my good friend, Roy Blunt and his staff for supporting, as well as Chairman Waxman and the ranking member, Tom Davis, and their staffs for their assistance in putting this bill together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to express my appreciation to our Majority Leader, Steny Hoyer, for bringing this bill to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in strongly supporting <bill type="h" number="5235">H.R. 5235</bill>, the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission Act.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400641" topic="">
    <paragraph>We have no more speakers, but I will continue to reserve.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I again want to thank Mr. Gallegly and Mr. Blunt for their work and leadership on this bill, and for Mr. Waxman, the chairman of the committee,  for enabling this to move forward in such an expeditious manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On 9 separate occasions, Congress has established a commission or a joint committee to celebrate the life and accomplishments of one of our Nation's Presidents or First Ladies. To date, we have honored James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, his wife, Eleanor, Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="5235">H.R. 5235</bill>, The Reagan Centennial Commission Act, would create a commission to add Ronald Reagan to that list. Like previous commissions, the Reagan Commission will use the occasion of what would have been President Reagan's 100th birthday in 2011 to call attention to his life and his numerous accomplishments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The commission will plan activities for the year leading up to the President's birthday. In the past, activities have included essay contests for students, research papers, symposiums, events at particular historical sites, and even joint sessions of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The commission will be composed of Members of Congress and individuals who have a knowledge or other expertise concerning the life of President Reagan, including his childhood, his career in Hollywood and his political career and legacy. Given the impact of President Reagan on his beloved California, the United States and the world, this is a fitting and a proper tribute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Ronald Reagan transformed our Nation. He spoke of limited government, commonsense values, and the bedrock notion of democracy which built this country. He embodied the optimism, the principles and the determination of our citizens and our Nation. The American people responded to his call, and he led this country back from a decade of decline, transforming politics forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a broadcaster, as an actor, as Governor and as President, he gave voice to America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to support this legislation, and I ask my colleagues to join me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400641" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for introducing this measure. I urge its passage, and I yield back.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Higgins) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="5235">H.R. 5235</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
