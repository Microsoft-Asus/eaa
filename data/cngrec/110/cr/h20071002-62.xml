    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we are often told safety doesn't happen by accident. And it is no accident that Caldwell County has been kept safe under the careful watch of Lenoir Fire Chief Ken Briscoe, who has been fighting fires for more than 30 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chief Briscoe wrote the book on firefighting, literally. He developed extensive training curricula while working with the State fire marshal's office, sharing his wisdom and experience with more than 1,400 North Carolina fire departments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chief Briscoe then returned to the front lines of firefighting, taking the helm of the Lenoir Fire Department, and we have been fortunate to have him. The Lenoir Fire Department is a top-notch organization. And because of his leadership there, Chief Briscoe has recently been named North Carolina's top firefighter by the North Carolina State Firemen's Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the words of one of his lieutenants, "Chief Briscoe is a firefighter's fireman." I am honored to know such a public servant and call him a friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations, Chief Briscoe. We are very proud of you. You have earned this award, and you have kept the people of western North Carolina safe. Thank you for your service.</paragraph>
