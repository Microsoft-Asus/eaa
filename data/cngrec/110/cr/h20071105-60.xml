    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank both of my colleagues for organizing this time tonight in recognition of National Bible Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My own experience with the Bible began when I was an 18-year-old freshman at the University of Kansas in 1973. I was approached by some people who asked me if I knew what was in the Bible. I said I knew what it was all about. But then I had to admit I had never read it for myself. The only honest thing I could do at that point was to read the Bible for myself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I read the Gospel of John, I ended up discovering a personal relationship with Jesus Christ who became my Lord and Savior. In that gospel He says: I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father but through Me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I don't know where in their spiritual journey people may be who are listening tonight, but I do know this: It is better to read the Bible for oneself and not just to take someone else's word for what is in it. For me, it made all of the difference in the world.</paragraph>
