    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the month of May marks National Foster Care Month. The foster care system provides a safe sanctuary for children who are unable to live safely in their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Its primary goal is to ensure their safety and well-being by providing them with critical services and working to find a safe and loving and permanent home. Over 500,000 American children are in the foster care system on any given day with over 100,000 of these children waiting to be adopted. They need our help, and I believe this is one place where every Member of the House can come together as one, committed to protecting these innocent children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This morning, we, Mr. Weller and I, had a hearing in the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support to review the changes and the challenges that child welfare agencies encounter in achieving positive outcomes for children and families under their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The hearing identified a number of areas that need to be improved to strengthen children and families, which I am committed to addressing. The hearing also highlighted the commitment of some of our most selfless Americans on behalf of some of our most vulnerable children. Millions of Americans serve as foster parents, and,  in doing so, have unselfishly opened their homes and their lives to children in need. These families are to be commended for working  cooperatively with human service agencies and biological parents to strengthen the lives of these foster children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should also recognize the work of dedicated case workers, juvenile court justices, physicians and the advocates who have committed their lives to ensuring the safety and well-being of our most vulnerable children. These tireless workers should be commended for their work on behalf of children and families in crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing May 2007 as National Foster Care Month and commending the dedication of foster parents, case workers, judges, service providers and advocates for their commitment to our Nation's most vulnerable children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would now ask unanimous consent to allow Representative Cardoza of California, who is the author of this resolution and a staunch advocate for improving the well-being of children in foster care, and actually an adoptive parent of a couple of kids from foster care, so he's done it at every level, to control the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I'd like to allow Mr. Weller to speak next.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="263">H. Res. 263</bill>, as amended, recognizing National Foster Care Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're here today to discuss foster care, starting with recognizing the thousands of foster parents who step in to care for so many vulnerable young people across America. It is right to celebrate the efforts of foster parents who step in to keep children safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to these individuals, thousands of local organizations, with both public and private sector employees and volunteers, are also active in foster care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the congressional district that I represent, one good example of a trusted foster care organization is Baby Fold, and Baby Fold is a multi-service family support agency that has served the Bloomington-Normal region in central Illinois for over a century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today the Baby Fold specializes in residential, educational, therapeutic, adoption, foster care, pregnancy counseling and family support prevention services for children and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many similar groups provide similar services in every congressional district in America. These organizations and dedicated individuals, supported by private donations and over $23 billion in taxpayer funds each year, help children and families lead safe and productive lives. Today we thank each of them and all of them for their efforts and dedication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, despite such dedicated efforts, we also know a lot more work is needed to ensure that all children are adequately protected from abuse and neglect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a longstanding interest in training of child welfare workers. Today I am reintroducing legislation I have authored in prior Congresses designed to address a glaring flaw in current rules by ensuring all child care workers, whether they work for a public agency or a private agency, have access to the same training needed to protect children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Take Will County Catholic Charities, which helps protect over 300 children in foster care in the congressional district I represent. There's simply no reason why a caseworker with Will County Catholic Charities should have less access to training than an equally dedicated caseworker who happens to be a public employee. Yet, that is what current Federal rules promote, and we should fix this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also need to do more to ensure that each and every child involved with the child welfare system is safe. Too often that is not the case. The Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support, on which I serve as ranking member, held a hearing on these challenges earlier today. We focused on areas like Clark County, Nevada, which is home to Las Vegas. A series of child deaths in Clark County has proven the risks for children when foster care and child protection systems fail to protect them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an August 5, 2006 article in the Las Vegas Review Journal put it, "Since 2002, at least 79 children have died of abuse or neglect at the hands of their parents, foster parents or other caregivers while under the watch of the Clark County Department of Family Services."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As troubling as that is, the response of local officials has only made matters worse. "For years, the county child welfare system has continuously avoided scrutiny by hiding behind a veil of confidentiality meant to protect children and families, but which the county has used to shield itself from oversight and criticism."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This sad trail of facts was supported by testimony we received today from Ed Cotton, who has broad experience in child welfare programs in my home State of Illinois, as well as New Jersey and Nevada. Most recently Mr. Cotton conducted a top-to-bottom review of Clark County, Nevada's child welfare program in the wake of tragedies there. And the evidence shows that Clark County is a case study of what happens when there's no oversight from those administering the program, and clearly is a national  embarrassment and a disgrace because Federal funds were involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Mr. Cotton testified, in Clark County and too many other places, this system has a very long way to go to ensure that all children are adequately protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in contrast with the Clark County tragedies, some areas have shown progress, but they're all too rare. Recent positive examples include my home State of Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Starting under the leadership of former Governor Jim Edgar in the late 1990s, the entire child welfare system in Illinois has undergone remarkable changes, resulting in there being 16,272 children today in foster care, or in January of 2007 that number, down from 28,202 children in September of 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New York City, under the leadership of Mayor Rudy Giuliani, also made changes that were positive, dramatically reducing the number of children who need foster care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many experts think we should build on this success and do better when it comes to targeting efforts to prevent abuse and neglect from occurring in the first place. That would result in fewer children needing foster care, tracking the Illinois and New York City experiences, and that would free more resources to ensure the safety, permanency and well-being of those children who do not need to be placed in foster care. Both goals are critical, better prevention and better oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, Congress took some modest steps in the right direction by targeting more funds for child abuse prevention and holding States more accountable for results. So there is increasing recognition of the steps needed to turn this program around.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the meantime, we will certainly need the continuing involvement and support of tens of thousands of foster parents. We owe them, and especially the children they protect each and every day, our continued full support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge bipartisan support for this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 263, a resolution recognizing May, this month, as the National Foster Care Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to begin my statement today by thanking subcommittee chairman, Mr. McDermott from Washington, for his outstanding support and work with us to bring this resolution to the floor. Chairman McDermott has dedicated virtually his entire life to the work of helping children that have been disadvantaged, and he deserves great praise and thanks for the hard work he continues to do in this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to recognize Mr. Weller for cooperating with us today in bringing this resolution to the floor, and also for his thoughtful comments that he just prepared.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, this resolution has a long and tortuous path to reaching the floor today. My staff's been working tirelessly with both the majority and the minority staffs of the Ways and Means  and Judiciary Committees. Before this bill was able to reach the floor under suspension, I was forced to make substantive changes which severely, in my opinion, gut the force of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, my original resolution, drawing upon the recommendations of the respected Pew Charitable Trust, made clear that we need more funds for the CASA Program, that we need more funds to better ensure that we have trained personnel working with foster children, and that we provide more resources to State agencies that deal with foster children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the interest of comity, I was forced to withdraw all these recommendations. Unfortunately, while of course I still support the thrust of the current resolution, without sufficient resources we will never fully tackle this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd also like to just point out, and it's important history for us all to remember, that in the previous majority in the last Congress, we took, in my mind, unconscionable measures to reduce the funding to foster children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 8, 2006, President Bush signed the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The CBO estimates that this measure cut funds of $1.3 billion over 10 years to foster care and $2.1 billion over 10 years to Medicaid that would affect these children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stood up on the House floor on that day in December when it was being debated in this institution and fought against those cuts. I, at that time, called it "Scroogenomics," because we were cutting the money for foster kids right before the Christmas holiday. And those concerns went for nought. The bill was passed anyway and signed into law, and foster kids continue to suffer because of that act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I won't belabor the point too much at this point because I really want to focus on the needs today. But, Madam Speaker, I speak passionately about foster children because I have a very personal interest in this issue. Seven years ago I adopted two foster children. In fact, Madam Speaker, as an aside, I'm doing this resolution because they asked me to do it today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, I have advocated on their behalf and on the behalf of the adoption of foster children in the California State Assembly and now here in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The need is tremendous and the statistics are sobering. It is estimated that there are 800,000 children in foster care at some point during any given year. Moreover, children of color are disproportionately represented in foster care. African American children make up about 16 percent of the Nation's children, but make up 35 percent of the children in foster care. These children enter foster care at higher rates and remain in care longer, for longer periods than white children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too many children in foster care sit waiting for permanent families. There are about 118,000 children in foster care waiting to be adopted, and numerous barriers keep them in limbo. Children often bounce from one system to another, from child welfare to juvenile justice to mental health as their needs intensify.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, about 20,000 children age out of the foster care system without ever being adopted, placed with grandparents or any other supportive adult. Oftentimes, these children have no connection whatsoever to any adult.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several studies released in 2005 documented the special challenges facing these youths, especially in the area of mental health, education and employment. They are especially poorly prepared to be self-sufficient young adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These children are waiting. Speaking from personal experience, there is no greater joy in life than helping a child. My wife and I can attest to this every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every child, no matter what their situation that they may be born to, deserves a chance to be raised in a stable and loving home. Innocent children should not be forced to bear the mistakes of their parents. We have a moral obligation to ensure that these children, no matter what background they come from, have a shot that is equal to the shot that every American has to the American dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a big problem that will require bold solutions. In order to save the next generation of children, we must rededicate ourselves to their welfare and to pledge to do whatever is necessary to nurture and protect them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution, by highlighting attention to their problems, is a necessary first step. But, Madam Speaker, other dramatic actions need to be taken. That is why I have introduced legislation to expand Medicaid coverage to children who age out of the foster care system, and I'm considering legislation to ensure that every foster child has a CASA representative, a court-appointed special advocate, the same type of court-appointed special advocate that saved my children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are urgent problems. They require bold solutions. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400429" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the subject of the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois?</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of our time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Weller. I know he cares passionately about these children, and while we sometimes disagree on the specifics, I know that all Members in this institution care passionately about foster children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the time to act is now. We need to do more to work on behalf of these children to eliminate the barriers that prohibit them from leading positive lives in society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must extend health care coverage to these young people until the age of 21. It's currently a voluntary program. Thirty-three States in this country do not offer health care all the way to the age of majority. We must, in fact, do more. And it is imperative. And frankly, if we can keep these young people out of a life of crime, out of falling into trouble, assisting them into becoming productive citizens, instead of the current situation where nearly 50 percent of children who age out of the  foster care system end up homeless after 1 year, we can do better for our citizens and we can, frankly, probably save money to the taxpayers of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this resolution. I urge my colleagues here today within earshot of my voice to redouble their efforts in helping this population of our citizenry that has become disadvantaged.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400387" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National Foster Care Month. Our child welfare system faces severe challenges and this month provides Congress with the opportunity to make needed reforms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our society has an obligation to ensure that all children are raised in safe and loving environments. For the 500,000 children in foster care, the State is responsible for providing a stable home, through reunification with their families, permanent placements, or adoption. Tragically, we are not doing a very good job. Half of all foster children have been in care for more than a year. A quarter have been in the system for more than 3 years. For foster children that remain in the system and "age  out" with no family supports, the future is not very bright. For those children, the odds are that they will end up in jail, homeless, or reliant on public assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problems that plague our child welfare system are largely the result of poor Federal and State policy decisions. Luckily, we have the power to reform those policies and directly affect the lives of the hundreds of thousands of children who are counting on us to do the right thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are very concrete steps we can take to improve the foster care system. Congress should reform the financing system to make sure that we provide support for every foster child. Currently, the Federal Government supports less than 50 percent of children in care. We can also take steps to improve the child welfare workforce and reduce the number of cases those workers have to handle. A Federal ceiling for the number of cases a worker can handle should be established so that children get the  attention needed to keep them safe. In addition, we have to provide better services to the estimated 25,000 children who leave care each year when they turn 18. All of these children should maintain Medicaid eligibility until they are 21 and we should invest further in training, education, and housing assistance for these children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution before us (<bill type="hr" number="263">H. Res. 263</bill>) can serve as a stepping stone for real action to protect our children and help them flourish. I am proud to support it.</paragraph>
