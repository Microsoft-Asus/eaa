    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today the liberal leadership of this House will attempt to override the President's veto of SCHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For weeks, they have been taking to the airwaves and talking about anybody that opposes this bill is against disadvantaged children. Well, that's just not what this bill is about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their bill would change a block grant program to an entitlement; it would provide taxpayer-funded health care to illegal immigrants; it would add more adults and what the IRS calls high-income families to the government health care rolls. It would even remove people from private insurance rolls and place them on the government rolls. And, most important, it's going to move that decision between a doctor and a patient to a bureaucrat. Well, that is what they are for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest that we show respect for the children of the working poor that this bill was initially set up to address, that we sustain the President's veto. Let's start over. Show the issue the respect it deserves.</paragraph>
