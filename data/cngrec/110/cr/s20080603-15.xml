  <narrative>UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 239 -- (Senate - June 03, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4920">S4920</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in a moment I wish to make a motion, but I would like to say as a prelude, for 6 years I have worked on legislation to provide for notification in the event of a data breach. During that period of time, 43 States have passed their own legislation. We would not know of data breaches if it were not particularly for the State of California which has put forward action on several of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill went to the Judiciary Committee. It has been heard in the Judiciary Committee. With the cooperation and support of the chairman of that committee, Senator Leahy, the bill has come out unanimously and has been pending before this body. There are holds on the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 180, <bill type="s" number="239">S. 239</bill>, data breach modifications; that the committee-reported amendment be considered and agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, without further intervening action or debate.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I will object--I value the interest and effort Senator Feinstein has put into this bill. I have also worked on this issue for some time. Last year, I think my bill cleared the committee by unanimous consent, and this year her bill is out on the floor. There are some differences. I commit to Senator Feinstein, post my objection today, that we will try to work together to see if we can reach accord. There are some  differences that are significant and some I am sure we can work out. So we will just have to give a good-faith effort at it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I object.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I could respond to something the Senator from California said, I commend Senator Feinstein for her efforts. She has worked very hard on this privacy matter. I realize there are some who want to block it. If you are a person who has had your identity stolen, if you have had your computer hacked, and somebody has gone into your bank account or somebody has ruined the chances of your children getting into a college, all from identity theft, you would be rushing  down here to vote for this bill. I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle, Republican Senators, will stop objecting. I hope we can pass this legislation.</paragraph>
