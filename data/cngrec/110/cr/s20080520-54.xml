    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor Wilfred Kadlec, who served in the Pacific theater of World War II with the U.S. Navy. On this Memorial Day, I would like to commend him for his brave actions and devoted service to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many of his generation, Kadlec responded honorably to the call of duty in the Second World War. Kadlec served his country bravely as a Petty Officer, Second Class, on the USS Radford and the USS Klondike. Kadlec's sacrifice is evident as he received the Purple Heart among many other medals during his service in the U.S. Navy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kadlec continued to serve his local and veterans' communities long after his military service ended in 1946. He served as an officer on the Liberty Township board for over 60 years. Also, he is a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 3179 of Faulkton, SD, and the American Legion Post 259 of Roscoe, SD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kadlec is one example of the great generation that carried our Nation through its most difficult times. We are indebted to their sacrifice and their  willingness to fight for the American people and way of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I would like to thank Wilfred for his service as we remember all those who have protected freedom around the world and have made sacrifices to keep America safe on this Memorial Day.</paragraph>
