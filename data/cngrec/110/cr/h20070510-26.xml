  <speaking speaker="400125" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a former school chief serving in Congress, I rise today to commemorate National Teacher Appreciation Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All across America this week, our Nation's school children, parents, PTAs and others are gathering to show their appreciation to the professional educators who work every day to make their futures brighter. Teacher Appreciation Week is a great opportunity to stop and pay tribute to the profession that shapes the world of tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to note that this new Democratic Congress is doing its part to support education in our communities. Democrats rejected President Bush's misguided educational budget cuts. Earlier this year, the House passed a balanced budget resolution that provides billions of dollars more for the non-neglected priorities like Head Start, secondary education, the Individuals With Disability Act and important initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, my colleagues and I have crafted bipartisan legislation to provide critical investment in our school construction and modernization across this country. The Rangel-Ramstad-Etheridge America Better Classrooms Act will provide $25 billion in interest-free bonds for local schools. This bill will make a difference in our communities, our children and our teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in this piece of legislation on National Teacher Appreciation Week.</paragraph>
