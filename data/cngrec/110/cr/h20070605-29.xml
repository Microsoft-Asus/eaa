  <speaking speaker="400231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to join my good friend from Florida, the distinguished ranking member of our committee, in recognizing the 40th anniversary of one of the great military triumphs of the 20th century, the so-called Six Day War. Some of us remember and everybody has read about the attempt of the neighboring Arab countries to annihilate the State of Israel 40 years ago. In a brilliant preemptive move, the Israeli military moved ahead and destroyed the air forces and much of the military  of the neighboring countries which were ready to destroy it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Six Day War transformed the shape of the Middle East and brought about the unification of the city of Jerusalem. Prior to the Six Day War, Jerusalem was closed to Israelis. Following the Six Day War, members of all faiths have had full and free access to the city of Jerusalem, and places of worship, Muslim, Christian, Jewish, are available to all individuals who seek an opportunity for peaceful prayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This body and the other body some years back called for the proper placement of the United States embassy in Israel's capital in Jerusalem. My good friend, the late Senator Patrick Moynihan, and I introduced this legislation which was strongly supported with significant majorities in both the House and the Senate. But administrations since that time have seen fit to postpone the move of our embassy to Jerusalem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I earnestly hope that with this commemorative resolution we again call the attention of this administration to its promise, clear and unequivocal, to move the embassy to Israel's capital, Jerusalem. Our embassy is in the capital of every single country with which we maintain diplomatic relations and the capital is designated by the country concerned. It is long overdue that this administration honor the President's personal commitment to move the United States embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="hc" number="152">H. Con. Res. 152</bill>, which congratulates the citizens of Israel on the 40th anniversary of that nation's victory over those who sought to destroy it in the Six Day War and commemorates the 40th anniversary of Jerusalem's reunification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jerusalem has historically been a united city, one holy for Jews, Christians and Muslims alike. Last week I had the privilege to go on a congressional delegation to Israel with my distinguished colleague and friend from Florida, Mr. Wexler. There we visited the old city of Jerusalem and prayed at the ancient Temple's legendary Western Wall. At that site, and throughout the City of Jerusalem, people have freely beseeched God for centuries. But had Jerusalem still been divided, as it was  from 1948 to 1967, the old city's holy places would have been off limits to us and to millions of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, I stand here today with particular appreciation for the religious freedom that Jerusalem's unity entails. It is unfortunate, however, that much of the world continues to refuse to recognize Jerusalem's unity and specifically its status as Israel's capital, a status which is both appropriate and a fact of reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 states that it is a matter of U.S. policy that Jerusalem should remain the undivided capital of Israel and that the United States should move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The resolution before us, <bill type="hc" number="152">H. Con. Res. 152</bill>, reaffirms U.S. policy in this regard, and I hope that the administration and our allies worldwide will move swiftly to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and to move their embassies to that city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to support this important resolution, to clearly articulate that Jerusalem must remain the undivided capital of Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hc" number="152">H. Con. Res. 152</bill>, and I take pride in joining my colleagues to congratulate the citizens of Israel on this important anniversary, as well as commending Jordan and Egypt for making peace with their neighbor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The anniversary marks the 40th year that the ancient and historic city has been administered as a unified city in which the rights of all faiths have been respected. I have to say, Mr. Speaker, that having worked in Jerusalem in 1965, I experienced that time when in fact people could not travel to all of Jerusalem, and in fact we know that that is very different today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also important that we use this anniversary to highlight the work that still needs to be done. The historic victory by the Israeli military greatly expanded Israel's territory, but with territorial gains came new problems. These unresolved issues have led to ever-increasing tensions that today manifest themselves in the form of Qassam rocket attacks and military insurgents. As we debate this resolution today, the region, as we know, finds itself in dire conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, I introduced a resolution calling on President Bush to dispatch a new special envoy to the Middle East to capitalize on every opportunity for progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the United States must be the leader in promoting peace. The current situation is simply unsustainable. So as we look back 40 years today, let us also look 40 years ahead. Let us look 40 years ahead and work toward a future, not fraught with conflict and strife, but coexistence, moderation and understanding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and continue to push for peace.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to my good friend, the distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400120" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman and colleagues for this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my father is from Israel, and every summer I spent a good portion of my childhood in Israel, 2 days after the 1967 war, every summer for 5 years, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1973, every summer going to Israel. I remember that moment, since the bulk of my childhood was spent there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Six Day War was obviously not only an amazing military accomplishment, a lot of people think today in retrospect that it is a pyrrhic victory, that things would have been so much easier for Israel had that victory not occurred; that David became Goliath.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of myths that I would like to address to the chairman, and also to the leader on the Republican side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One is it was not such a peaceful time pre the 1967 war. There were a lot of attacks on Israel because of indefensible boundaries. In fact, the peace with Jordan and Egypt could not have happened if it weren't for the 1967 war. There was no possibility, given the pan-Arabism that existed under Nasser, for any peace to have happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, one has to look at the 1967 war, that it created possibilities, as did the 1973 war, for peace to occur, and every nation that has decided to make peace with Israel, Egypt and Jordan, has had peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The war in 1967, because of the changes to the boundaries to the south, to the immediate east and to the north, redefined Israel's security. Once those nations came to terms with Israel's status, which is what the 1967 war accomplished, they accomplished and received peace, and land-for-peace has been at the premise of America's foreign policy, Israel's foreign policy, and was possible because of the outcome and the results strategically on the ground and in the environment because of 1967.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People remember the military accomplishment which was unique and stands out in the 20th century, but it also created an environment that allowed peace to happen, at least with the two countries that have chosen the road of peace with Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to pick up on my colleague from California and her comments about the next 40 years. The next 40 years needs to be a period of time where America, and this may be a little bit of a criticism here, we were always and always will be the indispensable leader in that region. The moment we walk away from that role the parties lose interest in discussing among themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would hope that immediately the President would again, and I echo what my colleague from California said, nominate somebody to be a Middle East envoy, to again create a dialogue between the Israelis and Palestinians, to find what the Jordanians and Egyptians have found with the Israelis, peace, based on the premise of land for peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But everybody should not only look at the military peace of the 1967 war, but it created an opportunity that today two countries that prior to that had fought in the 1967 war against Israel now recognize Israel and have economic, cultural and other types of trade, and that is only due to what happened in 1967.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To those who think 1967 was a pyrrhic victory, wasted, we wouldn't have in fact the Israeli-Jordanian agreement  or the Israeli-Egyptian agreement if it weren't for the victories that happened there. There were also other things that happened to Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One does hope though that as we look forward to trying to find resolution and look at the region as a whole, everybody has always described that Israel and the Arab conflict was at the heart of the Mideast. That is not at the heart. It is a problem. It needs to be resolved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the larger problem of the greater Gulf area is not one of the Israeli-Palestinian problem, although it is a significant problem; it is the radical philosophy that is dominating the young in the Arab world that we need to help resolve, because it is leading and feeding part of the terrorism, and that is the larger conflict. The Palestinian-Israeli problem is a problem, but it is not at the heart of the conflict in that region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to compliment our two leaders today, the chairman and the leader on the Republican side, for this resolution, for recognizing an historic moment that in fact without which we would not see the peace between Israel and Jordan and Israel and Egypt.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, before yielding back my time, I would like to make a couple of observations. As my colleagues pointed out, two of Israel's neighbors, Jordan and Egypt, have signed historic peace agreements with the State of Israel. And while this peace is not a full-fledged, blossoming, all-encompassing peace agreement, it certainly has meant the end of hostilities and the beginning of commercial, cultural, educational, touristic and diplomatic relations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The time is long overdue for Israel to be able to reach an agreement with both Lebanon and Syria, as well as the Palestinian people, so this long-suffering area, where all of the people have suffered for far too long and far too severely, at long last can be a region of peace and reconciliation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For this to come about, terrorism must end. You cannot make peace with people who are plotting daily to destroy your very existence. When Israel evacuated Gaza, it expected peace from that area. But, under Hamas, daily rocket attacks are unleashed on peaceful civilian Israeli border communities. Two women were killed just in recent weeks as a result of these monstrousattacks. Hezbollah in the north similarly is sworn to terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This must be put to an end if this important region is to join much of the rest of the world in moving ahead with economic progress, social progress, and the reconciliation of people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I honestly hope that our resolution paying tribute to the victory 40 years ago and reminding ourselves of our formal commitment to move the U.S. Embassy to its proper location in Jerusalem will serve as a reminder that the time is long overdue for normalizing the situation in this region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The end of terrorism, the move of our Embassy, will bring about a long prayed for and hoped for period of peace.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hc" number="152">H. Con. Res. 152</bill>, which recognizes the 40th anniversary of the reunification of the City of Jerusalem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week Israel is recognizing the 40th anniversary of the Six-Day War. On June 7, 1967, Israel reunified the city of Jerusalem, opening it to worshippers of all nationalities and religions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On that day Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan declared: "This morning, the Israel Defense Forces liberated Jerusalem. We have united Jerusalem, the divided capital of Israel. We have returned to the holiest of our holy places, never to part from it again. To our Arab neighbors we extend, also at this hour--and with added emphasis at this hour--our hand in peace. And to our Christian and Muslim fellow citizens, we solemnly promise full religious freedom and rights. We did not come to Jerusalem  for the sake of other peoples' holy places, and not to interfere with the adherents of other faiths, but in order to safeguard its entirety, and to live there together with others, in unity."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, even 40 years after Israel's overwhelming victory in the June 1967 War--a war fought to preserve Israel's very existence in the face of enemies determined to destroy it--Israel's stability is still threatened. At this critical time in Israel's history we must focus on what is of the utmost importance--furthering the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress must fully analyze and consider the Arab League Peace Initiative which offers Israel full normalization of relations with the Arab world and is widely viewed in Israel and around the world as an important opportunity and a real basis for negotiations that could end the Israeli-Arab conflict. While not perfect, this plan sets the table for fruitful negotiations and a final resolution of the conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must also consider negotiations with Syria. If successful, such negotiations could have significant positive impact with respect to limiting Iran's sphere of influence, calming the situation in Lebanon, weakening the support network for Hamas and Hezbollah, and delivering real security to Israel on its northern border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must call on President Bush to invest in serious, sustained, and effective efforts to improve the security situation on the ground today and re-establish a viable peace process that can deliver peace and security to Israel, and international acceptance of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I call on all of my colleagues to support <bill type="hc" number="152">H. Con. Res. 152</bill>, and I pledge to continue to work to maintain Jerusalem as Israel's indivisible capitol and to promote the policy of the United States to support a peaceful, two-state solution to end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, forty years ago this week, America's Israeli allies triumphed over the greatest threat to their nation's survival since it was founded in 1948. By emerging from the Six-Day War victorious, Israel demonstrated that a country devoted to liberty, equality and democracy could not only exist, but flourish, in one of the most volatile regions in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the weeks leading up to June of 1967, Israel's Arab neighbors amassed an immense force along their shared borders with the Jewish state. Their goal--as Egyptian President Gamel Abdel Nasser then put it--was "the destruction of Israel," and they assembled 465,000 troops, 2,800 tanks, and 800 aircraft on Israel's doorstep to achieve this malicious goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the armed conflict that followed, Israel defended itself honorably, courageously, and effectively--winning the war in just six days and taking control of lands previously held by the invading nations. And in an unprecedented act of compromise, Israel offered to give back the captured lands in return for nothing more than a promise that Israel's neighbors would join them in pursuit of peaceful co-existence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, Israel stated that the City of Jerusalem, which was placed under Israel's control as a result of the war, would once again be open to peoples of all faiths and nationalities--a provision that allowed Jews, Christians and Muslims alike to freely worship in the holy city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These actions in defense of peace and equality--undertaken by Israel just weeks after being attacked--help to demonstrate why the U.S.-Israeli relationship remains so strong to this day. The Israeli people have always worked hard to find common ground with their neighbors, even while facing profound threats to their safety and sovereignty. And just as Israel has never turned its back on the principles and values that all free nations share, America will never turn its back on her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pride to support <bill type="hc" number="152">H. Con. Res. 152</bill>, commemorating the 40th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem and recognizing the preceding struggle--and I look forward to many more years of fruitful partnership between the United States and Israel.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hc" number="152">H. Con. Res. 152</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the 1947 U.N. Partition Plan created two separate states in Palestine--one Jewish, and one Arab--it was a milestone in world history. Jerusalem was from this point on to be an international city--neither Jewish nor Arab, but shared by the two cultures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the excitement over this groundbreaking compromise was short-lived. Although Israel accepted the plan, the Arab world refused to sign on, and soon after attacked Israel, plunging the region into Arab-Israeli War of 1948. The result of this war was a division of Jerusalem in two, with one half being controlled by Israel and one half controlled by Jordan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1967, during the Six Day War, Israel retook control of the Jordanian half of Jerusalem. On June 7, 1967, a cease fire occurred, and Israel took full control over the entire city of Jerusalem. One year later, Israel declared a new holiday--Jerusalem Day--to commemorate the reunification of the city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the reunification, Israel held its Jerusalem Day with the slogan "Something Special for Everyone." I commend Israel and all of the inhabitants of Jerusalem for embodying the inclusiveness of the phrase "Something Special for Everyone."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support the resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if there's been any good news on the Middle East peace process over the last 7 years, it's that barriers to ending the conflict are less about final-status issues and more about the challenge of reaching the outcome that majorities on both sides know will be necessary: an independent Palestinian state, based on the 1967 borders, living side by side with Israel in peace, with a shared Jerusalem and a negotiated solution to the Palestinian refugee problem. Against that  backdrop, it is unclear to me what good comes from passing a resolution which would place Congress out of step with large parts of the Israeli political spectrum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution is disconnected from the reality on the ground. At a time of rocket attacks in Sderot, retaliations in Gaza, and renewed fears of war between Israel and Syria, it is, at a minimum, inappropriate for either the United States Congress or the Bush administration to stand in the way of whatever moves for peace Israel may choose to make, yet that is exactly what this resolution does. We should be more engaged at promoting a return to a peace process, not less, and we should be encouraging  compromise, not intransigence on the difficult issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jerusalem is Israel's capital and a city of unmatched significance for the Jewish people. I will never forget my first morning in Israel and what it was like to go on a run around the Old City. However, I must oppose a resolution that reaffirms the need to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem prior to a peace agreement because, as both Presidents Clinton and Bush have recognized, this harms our efforts at diplomacy and, therefore, the security of Israel and the United States. Instead, we should  keep faith with the Biblical injunction to "pray for the peace of Jerusalem," reject this senseless resolution, and recommit our support for serious efforts at peace in the Middle East and security for Israel.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400253" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hc" number="152">H. Con. Res. 152</bill>, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the reunification of the city of Jerusalem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The city of Jerusalem is a unique place in the world, steeped in history and faith, the eternal heart of three major world religions. Jerusalem has suffered war and conquest repeatedly throughout the ages, but I have faith that Jerusalem will never be fractured again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jews, Muslims, and Christians all find a spiritual home in Jerusalem, and it is essential that Jerusalem remain open to worshippers of all faiths. Unfortunately, for too many years of its history, access to the holy sites in Jerusalem was denied to some. But for the last 40 years, Israel has guaranteed access to all faiths, and the world community has been able to visit Jerusalem freely. I applaud Israel for this principled and fair policy, which has surely not always been easy to maintain. It  is an important affirmation of Israel's humane and democratic values that a country which finds itself under frequent attack would maintain a commitment to the openness of a site of such international importance as Jerusalem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the great emotion people feel about the holy city of Jerusalem has frequently found a false outlet in violence against others. It is a great sadness to me, and a great injustice against the history and sanctity of Jerusalem, that the city has been a flashpoint for so much violence in my lifetime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am deeply disappointed and frustrated that in the past several years the Middle East peace process has been derailed from the promising moments during the Clinton presidency. President Clinton was as deeply involved, at a personal as well as a political level, with the quest to find a permanent solution to the problems of the region as any world leader has ever been. While he was not quite able to attain the overarching peace agreement that he had worked so hard to achieve, President Clinton  recognized that finding a lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian issue needed to be a foreign policy priority of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since President Clinton left office, the involvement of the United States in the Middle East peace process has been scattered, sporadic, and ineffectual. Instead of redoubling our efforts to find peace, the United States launched a disastrous war in Iraq. We have sparked a bloody civil war in that country, inflamed Islamic fundamentalism throughout the Middle East, empowered the dangerous regime in Iran, ignored the frustrations and economic despair of the Palestinians, and damaged the immediate  security of our great ally in the region--Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the 40th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem, I view that city as a symbol of hope in the bleak landscape of the Middle East. Through Israel's commitment to the openness of Jerusalem, worshippers of all faiths can visit the holy Old City and see the beauty of its timeless stone buildings and ancient walls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States has always stood steadfast with its close ally Israel, and we must never cease doing so. We must recommit ourselves to the peace process in the Middle East, and lead the international community in forging a path to reconciliation and coexistence. We must dedicate ourselves to bringing about a new peaceful history in this divisive region, so that future generations may continue to find spiritual renewal in Jerusalem.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise as a strong supporter of Israel, of the Palestinian people, and of achieving a two-state solution where Israel and Palestine exist peacefully side by side. I have had the pleasure of visiting Jerusalem on more than one occasion, and am keenly aware of its importance to people of different faiths.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today, however, to voice my disappointment that <bill type="hc" number="152">H. Con. Res. 152</bill> conveys rather empty rhetoric instead of constructive observations and commitments. The United States has always served as the historical broker of peace agreements between Israel and its Arab neighbors and this is a role that we should continue to fulfill and I believe we should return to taking a much more active role in negotiations than we have under the Bush Administration's tenure. However, passage of a resolution by  the United States Congress which fails to recognize the progress of past peace negotiations runs contrary to achieving our ultimate goal of a lasting peace in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jerusalem is the rightful capital of Israel and will forever remain the capital of Israel. However, it has long been understood that a permanent agreement about the Palestinian areas of Jerusalem will be left to final-status negotiations. The sooner the United States returns to a more active participant in the peace negotiations, the sooner we can arrive to a solution for Jerusalem. But in the meantime, I think we tread on dangerous territory when Congress adopts positions that run counter to  issues that have yet to be negotiated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Israel's victory in 1967 was necessary to shatter the idea that the State of Israel could ever be destroyed. Make no mistake that I am firmly committed to the viability and security of a Jewish state in Israel. However, it would be naive to ignore the unresolved consequences of the war and foolish to believe that continued occupation does not pose a real threat to Israel's well-being. I hope that we can use the anniversary of the Six-Day War to look forward and reaffirm a real commitment by the  United States to achieve at last a workable two-state solution and a lasting peace.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400129" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while I applaud the fact that <bill type="hc" number="152">H. Con. Res. 152</bill> recognizes and reinforces a two-state solution to end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, I urge Congress and the Administration to move away from rhetoric and actively engage in steps that will foster lasting peace in the Middle East. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict not only grossly disrupts the lives of Israelis and Palestinians, it destabilizes the entire Middle East and enflames extremism, threatening U.S.  national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. involvement in Iraq has consumed the Administration's attention, but resolving the Israel-Palestinian conflict is an integral component for long-term peace in the region. Efforts to bring resolution to this conflict should not be put on the back burner because of the Administration's political fumbling in Iraq. I urge the Administration to reinvigorate its role as a fair and balanced broker and call on the U.S. Congress to recognize that securing peace in the volatile Middle East will require  a sustained financial commitment. And, I urge our friends and allies in the region to recognize that peace in the Middle East is in their own countries' best national security interests and to become more actively engaged in the peace process.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400326" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to address <bill type="hc" number="152">H. Con. Res. 152</bill>, recognizing the 40th anniversary of Israel's victory in the Six-Day War. This resolution will pass by a large majority, but I fear that it will become the latest in a series of missed opportunities for this body to support a viable peace process in the Middle East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution has several positive features. It is appropriate to commemorate Israel's victory in the Six-Day War. Its overwhelming military victory helped to secure Israel's continuing existence as a sovereign nation, something that was very much in doubt on the eve of the conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I particularly support the third clause of the resolution, which commends Egypt and Jordan for their bold and brave decisions to reach peace with Israel. Their leadership has been a critical, if often underappreciated, guarantor of Israel's security and survival, and I continue to hope that other nations in the region will follow their lead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also important to affirm that Jerusalem is the rightful capital of Israel, while acknowledging that the Palestinian people also have a  claim to Jerusalem as a capital and as a sacred city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevertheless, I am concerned that this resolution, while calling for peace negotiations, actually undermines U.S. efforts to secure the trust of all sides in the search for peace. The resolution pursues an obsolete notion, put forth as if the last decade of peace negotiations simply had not occurred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The idea of an undivided Jerusalem under sole Israeli sovereignty has not been part of any serious peace proposal--proffered by Israelis, Palestinians, or the international community--in the last several years. Israel's 2000 Camp David proposal and the Clinton compromise proposal, the 2002 Road Map for Middle East Peace, the 2003 Geneva Initiative, the 2003 "People's Voice" Initiative offered by Ami Ayalon and Sari Nuseibeh: none of these plans envision an undivided Jerusalem under sole Israeli  sovereignty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this idea is not just outdated in theory; it fails to reflect the present reality in Jerusalem. Israel's security barrier is rapidly creating a physical barrier between already segregated neighborhoods of East and West Jerusalem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recognizing Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel under sole Israeli sovereignty does not help to bring peace to Jerusalem or Israel, nor does it help achieve the vision the resolution espouses. In fact, the only thing likely to fully guarantee Jerusalem as the permanent capital of Israel is the official, international recognition of Israel's neighbors and the entire international community--and this recognition is unlikely so long as Palestinian claims to their own capital and sacred  city are denied.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Christians, Jews, and Muslims, we can best honor our holy city by helping it become a model of peace, unity, and reconciliation. Doing so requires sustained, courageous, and open-minded efforts to promote negotiations, stand against violence, and find solutions. Congress and our Administration must play a much more effective role, returning our nation to active and sustained engagement in seeking peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just returned from a brief visit to Jerusalem, now divided, threatened, strained by the anxiety of constant conflict. It is my great hope to one day visit a revitalized Jerusalem, undivided and shared as the capital of Israel and an independent Palestinian state, where Jews, Muslims, and Christians live together in peace and mutually honor the sites sacred to all of us. I can only wish that the resolution before us more adequately expressed this aspiration.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the House recognizes the 40th anniversary of the Six Day War and congratulates Israel on administering a unified Jerusalem as a city open to people of all faiths.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to join in congratulating the people of Jerusalem on the 40th anniversary of the unification of this ancient city. Further, I wish to commend the State of Israel for opening this holy city to followers of all faiths. Jerusalem is the holiest city of the Jewish faith, the third holiest Islamic city, and is the site of many significant Christian sites. Because of its important status to all these religions, Jerusalem must remain an undivided city that protects the rights of all ethnic and  religious groups. Israel has recognized this important reality and allows members of all faiths to visit and worship at their holy sites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that all parties in the Middle East will use Jerusalem's example of religious coexistence to work towards a final negotiated peace in the region. A lasting peace between Israel and its neighbors is in the interests of all countries in the region and overall international stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, it is my belief that the United States should help to reaffirm its commitment to a strong relationship with Israel by placing its embassy and staff in its capital city of Jerusalem. Accordingly, I hope that the President will consider the relevant language in the legislation before the House today and abide by the provisions of the Jerusalem Embassy Act passed by Congress in 1995. This would be an important step in cementing the bond between the United States and Israel at this critical  time in history.</paragraph>
