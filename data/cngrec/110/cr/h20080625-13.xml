  <narrative>BROADCASTER FREEDOM ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6012]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>One year ago, over 300 Democrats and Republicans stood together to oppose efforts to restore the so-called Fairness Doctrine to the airwaves of this country for a single year. It was an encouraging vote. But, following that vote, I introduced the Broadcaster Freedom Act, which would permanently ban the Fairness Doctrine from ever coming back, and so far, not one single House Democrat has signed our position for an up-or-down vote on broadcast freedom. Now we know why.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Asked yesterday if she supported reviving the Fairness Doctrine, Speaker  Nancy Pelosi replied, "Yes." At a meeting at the Christian Science Monitor, she said that the Broadcaster Freedom Act would not receive a vote because "the interest of my caucus is the reverse."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to Speaker Pelosi, with respect, defending freedom is the paramount interest of every Member of the American Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my Democrat colleagues to take a stand for freedom. Oppose the Democrat leadership's plan to censure the airwaves of American talk radio and American Christian radio. Sign the discharge petition for broadcast freedom, and help us send the Fairness Doctrine to the ash heap of broadcast history where it belongs.</paragraph>
