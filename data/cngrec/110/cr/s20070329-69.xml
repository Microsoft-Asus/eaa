  <speaking speaker="300073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the passage of <bill type="h" number="1132">H.R. 1132</bill>, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Reauthorization Act of 2007, a program that the Senator from Texas, MRS. HUTCHISON, and I have worked closely to reauthorize. <bill type="h" number="1132">H.R. 1132</bill>, like our companion bill <bill type="s" number="624">S. 624</bill>, reauthorizes the successful Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. The legislation authorizes increased funding for this program to $275 million over 5 years and provides States with greater flexibility  to reach priority, hard to reach populations including women living in rural areas and racial and ethnic minorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Hutchison and I would like to clarify with the chairman and ranking member the intent of the new waiver demonstration project. The legislation authorizes the establishment of a waiver demonstration project that will allow States to leverage nonFederal funds for breast and cervical cancer screening and follow-up services, reduce barriers to screening, and increase the number of women served. Non-Federal funds for breast and cervical cancer services/activities are available in  some States through State or local government sources and private sources. Leveraging these non-Federal funds will augment limited available Federal funding and thus enable the efficient and effective utilization of resources to provide education and outreach to screen</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Maryland for her support and partnership in reauthorizing this very important piece of legislation, and I appreciate the assistance we received from Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Enzi, as well as the administration and our House colleagues. Early detection of breast and cervical cancers saves lives  and is essential to our fight against these devastating diseases. The national  early detection program has given millions of disadvantaged women access to vitally important cancer screenings, and I am proud of our commitment to continuing the Federal investment in these services. I hope that the new waiver demonstration project will provide the small number of States seeking to fully leverage private contributions the ability to capitalize</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I commend Senators Mikulski and Hutchison for their leadership on this issue and thank Senator Enzi for his hard work to get this bill through the Senate. I agree with Senator Mikulski that it is the intent of Congress that the Secretary, acting through the Director, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, will administer the described demonstration project as part of its overall management of the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Program.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank all of the key members--Senator Hutchison, Senator Mikulski, Senator Kennedy and others for their ongoing work and dedication to this program. I am glad that we have been able to complete our work today and send this bill to the Presiaent. I also agree that it is our intent that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention administer the new waiver authority which is added to the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Program as part of this  reauthorization process. The waiver authority is integral to the overall program implementation. As such, it should remain within the purview of the CDC.</paragraph>
