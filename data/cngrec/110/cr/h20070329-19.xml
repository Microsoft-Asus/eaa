  <speaking speaker="412189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Juanita Haugen, who passed away earlier this month after a courageous battle with lung cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Juanita's passion for education and her commitment to students enriched the lives of many people in our congressional district. Her efforts and dedication to public service leave a legacy that will continue to benefit my hometown and the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Juanita joined the Pleasanton school system after leaving her job as a probation officer to care for her children at home. She was elected to the Amador District Board in 1979 and was among the first trustees elected to the Pleasanton Unified School District, a position which she held for the rest of her career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Juanita's efforts won her many awards, it was her ability to inspire others with her passion for learning that separated her from her peers. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of Juanita Haugen and sending our thoughts and prayers out to her family and friends.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
