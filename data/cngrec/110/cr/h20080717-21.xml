  <narrative>THE DRILL ACT PROMOTES DRILLING ON 311 MILLION ACRES OF OPEN LAND -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6680]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Bush-Cheney energy plan is now 95 percent implemented and we are paying for it at the pump. It's no mystery how it happened. Two oilmen in the White House let Big Oil literally write the energy plan. And while Republicans continue to demand opening up more areas for drilling, Democrats are asking why not drill on 311 million acres of Federal land already open for energy production?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Day after day Republicans say drill, drill, drill. But they haven't once asked why oil companies are sitting on 68 million acres of already-leased land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This country needs a comprehensive plan for energy independence, and responsible drilling is part of that plan. Why not open new areas for development that will save consumers little at the pump decades down the road when there are 68 million acres of land ready for drilling?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Democrats don't want to make the American consumer wait another 10 to 20 years for any relief. Today we hope that the Republicans will join us in demanding that Big Oil start drilling on the leases they already have, otherwise lose the leases. It's time to tell Big Oil, "Use it or lose it."</paragraph>
