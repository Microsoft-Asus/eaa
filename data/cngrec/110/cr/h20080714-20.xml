    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1080, honoring the extraordinary service and exceptional sacrifice of the 101st Airborne Division, more commonly known as the Screaming Eagles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 16, 1942, the day the 101st Airborne Division was activated, Major General William C. Lee observed that "The 101st has no history, but it has a rendezvous with destiny." Since that day over 60 years ago, the 101st Airborne Division has distinguished itself time and again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently headquartered at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, the 101st Airborne Division has faithfully answered America's call to service and has a distinguished history as the only air assault division in the world. The division cleared the way for the 1st and 4th Infantry Divisions at Omaha and Utah Beach on D-day in Normandy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most notable of the Screaming Eagles' achievements was the defense of Bastogne, Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge, where the division was surrounded by advancing enemy forces who demanded their immediate surrender. Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe led the 101st through the siege, which was broken on December 26, 1944.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The division again proved its laudable skill and courage fighting bitter battles in Vietnam. The 101st established an extraordinary helicopter force of troops trained and ready for combat in Vietnam. Dense jungle and uneven terrain made the use of helicopters highly desirable for maneuverability and aided in the Tet Offensive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 101st Airborne Division (Air Mobile) was designated the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) in October 1974. The Screaming Eagles continued their rendezvous with destiny by faithfully completing combat missions in the Middle East, and humanitarian and peacekeeping missions in Rwanda, Somalia, Haiti, and in Bosnia. During the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, the division  conducted the largest air assault in history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the 101st continues their history of exemplary combat service to our Nation in Iraq and Afghanistan. Thousands of men and women proudly wear the patch of the Screaming Eagle on their right shoulder as they deploy to defend the liberties that we enjoy here in the United States. Today, we recognize the Screaming Eagles and the hundreds of thousands of their brethren in uniform who volunteer to defend our Nation each and every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400341" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this resolution honoring the extraordinary service and exceptional sacrifice of all those who have served and are serving in the 101st Airborne Division known as the Screaming Eagles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than 65 years, since its formation in 1942, the division has established a record of bravery, commitment, military prowess and excellence that marks it as one of the great military units in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When activated, the division's first commander told his men that, while the division had no history, it had a "rendezvous with destiny." And through five wars, the soldiers of that division have never failed that vision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In World War II, from Normandy to Holland to Bastogne, and Hitler's Eagle's Nest, the division fought with great distinction. More than 2,000 of its members died defending freedom. Deployed to Vietnam for 7 years, the division never failed to accomplish any mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though few of its battles became household names, the division's 4,000 deaths and 17 Medals of Honor are evidence of the unhesitating courage and sacrifice the division has made in Southeast Asia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, tens of thousands of the 101st soldiers have deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, helping to secure liberty for those nations, denying a safe haven to terrorists, and helping to protect America's interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, it is entirely fitting that we honor the 101st Airborne Division as one of the great American military units. More importantly, we must recognize and honor the tremendous debt that we owe to all who have served so well in this storied and historic division.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Whitfield, for introducing this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to my friend and colleague from Kentucky, Mr. Ed Whitfield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400431" topic="">
    <paragraph>I certainly want to thank the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) and the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Rogers) as well as Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for bringing this resolution to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As has been said, Fort Campbell, Kentucky is the home of the 101st Airborne Division known as the Screaming Eagles, which is the only air assault division in the world. It has been my distinct privilege and pleasure to represent the First Congressional District of Kentucky, which is the home of this great unit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to say that, while this resolution focuses explicitly on the 101st Airborne Division, Fort Campbell is also the home of the 160th Special Aviation Regiment, the Fifth Special Forces Group, the 86th Combat Support Hospital, and we have many young men and women also serving at the Blanchfield Army Hospital as well as the Garrison Command at Fort Campbell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was delighted that the gentleman from Connecticut and the gentleman from Alabama talked briefly about the history of this great 101st Airborne Division. I might say that, throughout its history, 19 individuals of that unit have received the highest declaration offered by the U.S. Government, which is the Medal of Honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom began, thousands of members of the 101st Airborne Division have been deployed no less than three times, performing dangerous counter-insurgency operations and working to secure liberty in nations that once served as safe havens for terrorists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might also say that we pay special tribute to the nearly 200 members of the 101st Division who have lost their lives fighting the global war on terrorism, and throughout its proud history over 6,000 have lost their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the dangers and difficulties faced by these soldiers and their loved ones, I might say that 65 percent reenlist and request to stay with the 101st Airborne Division, which certainly demonstrates the loyalty to the proud history and tradition of this unit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd like to thank all of the cosponsors of this resolution. The brave soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division have never hesitated to answer this Nation's call to duty, and it is my great privilege to honor them with this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, again, I just want to salute Mr. Whitfield's and Mr. Rogers' fine comments. They've said it all.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400395" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="1080">H. Res. 1080</bill>, a resolution honoring the extraordinary service and sacrifice of the Screaming Eagles of the 101st Airborne Division of the United States Army and their families. I am proud to represent in this chamber a portion of Fort Campbell, where the Screaming Eagles are based.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> This resolution is especially timely as soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division are currently deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. In April, Major General Jeffrey Schloesser, who commands the Screaming Eagles, took over as the senior U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Under General Schloesser, the 101st Airborne Division took over command of Regional Command East, an area comprised of 14 provinces in eastern Afghanistan. At the same time, three Brigade Combat Teams from the 101st Airborne Division  are serving in Iraq. Many of the soldiers have been deployed multiple times in Afghanistan and Iraq, some of those deployments under the command of General David Petraeus, now the Commander of U.S. Central Command.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> One need only look at the history of the Screaming Eagles to understand the legacy of the 101st Airborne Division. Originally activated during World War I, the Screaming Eagles would go on to serve in World War II, Vietnam, and Desert Storm, along with their most recent deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> During World War II, the soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division would have the distinction of being the first Americans to land in France as part of the D-Day invasion. Nearly 60 years later, the Screaming Eagles became the first conventional unit to deploy in the Global War on Terror; participated in Operation Anaconda, a tough early battle in Afghanistan; and help lead the invasion into Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Mr. Speaker, thank you for joining us today to honor the 101st Airborne Division, the men and women who have earned their place in history. They and their families will be in our thoughts and prayers as they continue to serve with distinction.</paragraph>
