  <speaking speaker="400640" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, LEE TERRY, from the Second Congressional District, my neighbor. I, too, Mr. Speaker, want to extend my heartfelt sympathies to the families and friends of this senseless act of violence. Sometimes we are shocked by just how brutal the world can be and that came home to rest yesterday in Nebraska, where people, joyfully going about their holiday season, shopping, having time with loved ones, people wrapping gifts, all of a sudden being  punctuated with this horrific act of violence that left eight people dead and in turn the perpetrator of the crime killed himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Nebraska prides itself on being a wonderful place to live and to work and raise a family, and Omaha is truly a good community. I think if we have won consolation here, it will be that the community will pull together and will heal together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal note, as well, as Congressman Terry mentioned, one of the victims of the tragedy was from my district and in fact had been a personal acquaintance and friend of mine, Gary Scharf. He was active in civic affairs. I knew he took great pride in the son that he had. I too wish to extend my deepest heartfelt sympathies to his family as well.</paragraph>
