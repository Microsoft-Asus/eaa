    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the University of California at Santa Barbara men's soccer team on their 2006 National Collegiate Athletic Association championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After a tough, hard-fought game, the Gauchos of UC Santa Barbara claimed the 2006 NCAA championship by a score of 2-1.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to congratulate the UCLA Bruins, the opposing team in the final game, on a well-played season. The Bruins had a season record of 14-6-4 and had three players named to the NCAA All-Tournament team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the UC Santa Barbara men's soccer program appeared in the championship match twice in the last 3 years, this is the school's first men's soccer title and the university's second Division I title in athletics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They accomplished many successes this year beyond the NCAA championship. The men's soccer team also won the 2006 Big West regular season championship and had a record of 17-7-1. The team was led to victory by head coach Tim Vom Steeg, assistant coach Greg Wilson, assistant coach Neil Jones, and goalkeeper coach Erick Foss. Also assisting the team was the UC Santa Barbara director of athletics, Gary Cunningham.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I again congratulate the student athletes, coaches, and the University of California at Santa Barbara on their 2006 men's soccer team's achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such times as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 70. This resolution recognizes the outstanding 2006 record of the University of California at Santa Barbara men's soccer team as well as their triumph in winning the university's first-ever national title in soccer and only the second in any other sport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With a 2-1 victory over the University of California at Los Angeles at the 2006 NCAA men's College Cup, the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos ended the season with a 17-7-1 record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The two rivals, whose schools are separated by less than 100 miles, played hard despite game time temperatures of 24 degrees and a windchill of 11. Still, in a testament to their strength and senior leadership, the Gauchos overcame the weather, as well as a 7-6 mid-season record, to become only the second unseeded team since 2000 to win the national title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shortly after the season ended and for the second time in 3 years, UC Santa Barbara head coach Tim Vom Steeg earned the most prestigious honor a Division I coach can receive when he was named national Coach of the Year by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America. According to College Sports Television, "in his eight seasons at the helm of UCSB, Vom Steeg has transformed a program that went 2-17-2 overall in the year prior to his arrival to a Division I power and reigning national champions."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the first 33 years of the program's existence, Santa Barbara had never reached the NCAA tournament but has now made five straight post-season appearances under Vom Steeg's guidance, including two trips to the College Cup.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my congratulations to head coach Tim Vom Steeg and all the hardworking players, the fans, and to the University of California at Santa Barbara. I am happy to join my good friends and colleagues, Representatives Capps and Gallegly, in honoring this exceptional team and all of its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to support this Revolution congratulating the University of California, Santa Barbara men's soccer team for winning the NCAA Division I National Championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along with my colleague ELTON GALLEGLY, I am thrilled to have this opportunity to congratulate every player, coach, alumnus, faculty member and supporter of UCSB.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 3, 2006, the UCSB Gauchos captured the National Championship by scoring two goals against the University of California, Los Angeles. This is UCSB's second national title in school history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While all the gauchos played their hearts out, I'd like to acknowledge two stand-out performances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sophomore Nick Perera scored a goal and assisted on Eric Avila's game-winner on his way to earning All-College Cup Most Outstanding Offensive Player of the Tournament honors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Junior Andy Iro, despite playing through an injury, helped keep UCLA at bay and was named the All-College Cup Most Outstanding Defensive Player.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the beginning UCSB's season was plagued by inconsistent play, the Gauchos fought to recover, winning 10 of their last 11 games, including 6 straight in the tournament.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coach Tim Vom Steeg, a UCSB alum, and his staff, Greg Wilson, Neil Jones, and Erick Foss, deserve tremendous praise not only for their impressive leadership in the 2006 season but also for leading the dominating Gauchos to their second NCAA National Championship game in 3 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coach Vom Steeg's colleagues were so impressed with his coaching abilities that they named him the National Soccer Coaches Association of America National Coach of the Year, the most prestigious award that a Division I soccer coach can receive, for the second time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while the men's soccer team is a great example of the excellence the University produces, there is much more to celebrate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of you know, my husband Walter was a professor of Religious Studies for more than 30 years at UCSB.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through his experiences as a professor, and my own as a graduate, I have watched the university rightfully gain national attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The university currently has five Nobel Laureates on faculty and was recently ranked in the top 15 best public schools in the Nation by U.S. News &amp; World Report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with a breathtakingly beautiful campus, it's no wonder that the men's soccer team and the university can attract such notable talent from all over the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If any of my colleagues ever find themselves on California's Central Coast, I encourage you to stop by this beautiful campus and see for yourself all that it has to offer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And of course, don't forget to catch a soccer game at Harder Stadium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Go Gauchos.</paragraph>
