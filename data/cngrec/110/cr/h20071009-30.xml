  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the Tropical Forest Conservation Act Reauthorization bill and urge my colleagues to do so as well. I would particularly like to recognize the efforts of Congressman MARK KIRK, the sponsor of <bill type="h" number="2185">H.R. 2185</bill>. Congressman Kirk is a long-time champion of this innovative debt-for-conservation program. Mr. Kirk's legislation extends and expands a vitally important environmental initiative launched during the Clinton administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, over the past 9 years this program has resulted in 12 Tropical Forest Conservation Act agreements in Asia, the Caribbean, Central and South America. These agreements have provided $135 million to help conserve 50 million acres of tropical forests. The Tropical Forest Conservation Act has become one of the most effective foreign policy tools that the executive branch has at its disposal to encourage developing states to take action to protect and preserve tropical forests.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H11349]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The program has been a tremendous success. It has provided needed funding to actively pursue debt swaps, buybacks, and debt restructuring with developing nations in return for concrete expenditures aimed at protecting vital natural resources. This mechanism inspires more prompt debt servicing and gives foreign governments a greater sense of responsibility for preserving the global heritage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2185">H.R. 2185</bill> would expand the program in a very significant way by extending its debt-relief-for-conservation mechanism to expenditures aimed at protecting coral reefs and sensitive marine environments. Coral reefs and coastal marine environments provide a host of benefits to humankind. They harbor a major share of the world's marine biological diversity, and act as vital nurseries and seeding grounds for many sensitive deep sea species. They also provide the foundation for economic, social and  recreational activities of immeasurable value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, coral reefs are extremely sensitive treasures. However, the shocking reports of wide-scale coral bleaching that has occurred around the globe in recent years should serve as a wake-up call for all of us. Urgent action is needed to mitigate the contributions that human activities are making to this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2185">H.R. 2185</bill> provides just the kind of creative, targeted and mutually beneficial assistance that is clearly required to tackle this important ecological threat. <bill type="h" number="2185">H.R. 2185</bill> will also enable more key countries to participate in the program. Currently, in order to qualify for the Act's mutually beneficial mechanism, a country must have an IMF agreement in place. Under the new language, eligibility would also extend to nations that are implementing sound macroeconomic policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the executive branch has partnered with us in crafting this reauthorization, and has expressed its interest in seeing it pass this year. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412250" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill <bill type="h" number="2185">H.R. 2185</bill>, which would reauthorize and amend the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998. As the total territory of the world's tropical forests continue to decline, programs such as that created by the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 are an important component of international efforts to slow and hopefully reverse the decline at the start of the new century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act, a country with a tropical forest within its borders may seek an agreement with the United States whereby some of the debts it may owe us can instead be utilized to support activities that maintain those tropical forests. The bill would reauthorize this important conservation program through fiscal year 2010. The bill also amends the program in order to make coral reefs eligible for coverage under the program as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important response to the increasing evidence of decline in the world coral reefs, which, along with tropical forests, are a vital environmental resource. It is important that we preserve such underwater treasures, not just for future generations to enjoy, but to ensure the sustainability of our world's fragile ecology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, enactment of this bill would authorize a continuation of these important conservation efforts for the next 3 fiscal years. I support this measure and urge my colleagues as well to support this measure.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400170" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2185">H.R. 2185</bill>, a resolution that I introduced with my good friend Congressman Mark Kirk and the bipartisan support of 30 other cosponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to first extend my appreciation for the hard work and efforts made by all parties who worked to craft this important bipartisan piece of legislation. Congressman Kirk and I worked closely with the Nature Conservancy, Conservation International, the World Wildlife Fund, the Wildlife Conservation Society, the Office of Management and Budget, and Departments of State and Treasury on this bill. I thank each of these bodies for their input, cooperation and support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This innovative program allows eligible developing countries to utilize all funds spent on tropical forest preservation toward foreign debt payments to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="2185">H.R. 2185</bill> builds on the already successful and sound economic and conservation law, the Tropical Forest Conservation Act, TFCA, of 1998.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 7 years, the program created by that act has simultaneously accomplished two key goals: providing relief for the burden of debt on developing countries and promoting increased international tropical forest conservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The program's achievements speak for themselves. Since its inception, 12 "debt-for nature swaps" have been signed in developing countries in Asia, the Caribbean, Central and South America, generating $135 million in debt relief for these countries and conserving some 50 million acres of tropical forests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation reauthorizes and expands this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By reauthorizing the Tropical Forest Conservation Act, the House is continuing to strengthen the indigenous economies and civil society of developing countries while protecting both the world's forests and endangered marine habitats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, by continuing to protect our rainforests we are protecting future medicinal storehouses. The medicinal value of these rainforests cannot be underestimated. Today some 120 prescription drugs sold worldwide today are derived directly from rainforest plants. By conserving our rainforests, we are providing possible cures for life-threatening diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By expanding this legislation, we are improving on an already responsible, sensible and successful initiative to conserve more ecosystems and relieve more countries' debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most significant expansions we made to the Tropical Forest Conservation Act in this bill extends the program to apply to all forests, coral reefs and associated coastal marine ecosystems. Including coral reefs and related marine areas under the scope of TFCA will encourage the conservation of these endangered marine environments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coral reef ecosystems throughout the world face numerous threats and even possible extinction. Threats to coral reef, in turn, threaten the species and livelihoods that depend on them. Coral reef offers protections from storms, wave damage, and erosion and also provides various economic opportunities from fishing to ecotourism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By providing incentives for developing nations to conserve their coral resources, we are in effect protecting coastal landscape's and maintaining coastal quality of water of some of the most important coral reef ecosystems in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another important alteration we made to the legislation expands the programs eligibility to additional countries. Current law forbids governments of beneficiary countries to be grant recipients unless there are "exceptional circumstances." However, for many countries their governments are the sole managers of their ecosystems, thereby preventing them from receiving the funds. By increasing the Treasury Department's authority to provide funds to governments of beneficiary countries, our legislation  extends the programs' eligibility to even more developing countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A final significant change we made to the program authorizes additional funding for audits and evaluation and allows these funds to be used for monitoring and administration. Increasing the funding amount allows the Treasury Department to better monitor all deals and improve oversight over the entire program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Top notch strategies and technologies needed to conserve and protect our international ecosystems can be found right here in the United States. In my State of Florida, several institutions have long been at the forefront of efforts to preserve these marine habitats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Florida Aquarium, a non-profit education and research institution in Tampa, has developed cutting edge technologies and protocols for coral conservation including how to safely introduce cultural coral into wild reefs. Until the museum pioneered this technology, there was no viable solution to "quickly" rebuild destroyed and dying reefs. Developing countries participating in our debt relief initiative could greatly benefit from the museum's technology and expertise, and I strongly encourage  these countries to seek out the museum as a resource in their efforts to rehabilitate coral.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, located outside of my district in Fort Pierce, does equally outstanding work to investigate the causes of and prevent coral reef degradation and deforestation. Dr. Brian Lapointe of the Center for Coastal Research at Harbor Branch has spent the majority of his career studying threats to the marine ecosystems in island nations such as Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Martinique and St. Lucia. He has successfully assisted these countries by helping them  understand the effects of human impact on coral reef.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Lapointe and others at Harbor Branch Oceanographic have tirelessly worked to educate communities on rehabilitation strategies and future conservation techniques. People like Brian Lapointe and institutions like Harbor  Branch Oceanographic can help countries that get assistance through the Tropical Forest Conservation Act program to restore and protect valuable and irreplaceable coral reefs and other marine ecosystems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is a win-win-win situation. With the passage of this bill, Congress can further alleviate debt in developing countries, provide long-term sustainable financing for environmental conservation and protection for important world ecosystems, and advance medicinal research and increase United States assistance to developing countries and further our credibility overseas. Reauthorizing the Tropical Forest Conservation Act provides numerous benefits to developing nations, to the United States,  and to our planet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we reauthorize the Tropical Forest Conservation Act, we take an important and critical new step to help the world preserve and restore its natural resources and vital ecosystems. This reauthorization will continue our efforts to preserve the world's forests, coral reefs, and associated coastal marine ecosystems. The Tropical Forest Conservation Act will create an invaluable debt-for-nature exchange that not only benefits the global economy, but also the global environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Protecting our natural resources is a daunting responsibility, and coral reefs present unique challenges to protect and rebuild. They are fragile, slow-growing, and easily damaged by passing ships, changes in temperature, or severe weather. Despite these challenges, they are an integral part of our environment. Corals support economies, protect coastlines, and act as ecosystems for thousands of species of sea life. They may also provide information for the development of new drugs or understandings  of human disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Florida Aquarium, a non-profit education and research institution in Tampa, has extensive experience in developing cutting edge technologies and protocols for coral conservation, including how to safely introduce cultured coral onto wild reefs. This facility has pioneered the methods and technology needed to confidently direct a coral health certificate program wherein aquacultured corals are certified as safe for introduction into the wild. Until the Florida Aquarium developed this certification  technique for artificially aquacultured coral, there was no acceptable solution for doing so. This made rebuilding reefs time-consuming and expensive, and often led to the destruction of the wild coral that scientists were trying to restore. Today, the Florida Aquarium continues to lead the scientific community as the only institution in the world that can certify aquacultured coral for wild reefs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, developing countries participating in our debt relief initiative could greatly benefit from the Florida Aquarium's technology and expertise.

I am proud to support this important legislation in its effort to preserve our natural resources.</paragraph>
