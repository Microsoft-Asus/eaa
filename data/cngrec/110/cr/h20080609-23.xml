    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5938">H.R. 5938</bill>, the Former Vice President Protection Act of 2008, a much-needed permanent solution that would authorize protection for our former Vice Presidents and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you no doubt know, the President of the United States, along with his or her spouse and children, are provided continued protection by the United States Secret Service after the President leaves office, but the law does not provide such protection for a former Vice President and his or her family. Rather, Congress has, on an intermittent basis, authorized such protection for limited periods of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the near future, Congress will again be faced with this issue. In January, Vice President Cheney will be leaving office, and we will presumably decide to provide continued Secret Service protection for him and his family, as has been done for every Vice President in recent decades. But this ad hoc process is inefficient, and the legislation before us replaces it with a permanent fix to current law. Specifically, it provides for Secret Service protection to a former Vice President,  including his or her spouse and children under 16 years of age, for 6 months, and it permits this period to be extended if information or conditions so warrant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5938">H.R. 5938</bill>, the Former Vice President Protection Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Secret Service must be authorized by law or the President to provide protection. Federal law provides Secret Service protection to sitting Presidents and Vice Presidents, former Presidents, their spouses and children, visiting heads of state, Presidential candidates, and other dignitaries. However, the statute does not include former Vice Presidents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past 30 years, it has been common practice for former Vice Presidents to receive protection on a temporary basis via a joint resolution of Congress or Presidential memorandum. This temporary protection typically continues for 6 months after the Vice President leaves office. When necessary, Congress or the President has extended this protection for an additional 6 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5938">H.R. 5938</bill>, the Former Vice President Protection Act, makes this routine  practice a permanent authority of the Secret Service. <bill type="h" number="5938">H.R. 5938</bill> amends title 18 to provide statutory protection of former Vice Presidents, their spouses and their children under the age of 16 for the initial 6 months after leaving office. The bill also provides the Secret Service with the authority to reevaluate the need for continued protection in 6-month increments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The permanent authority granted by <bill type="h" number="5938">H.R. 5938</bill> will improve the Secret Service's ability to prepare for the protection of Vice Presidents after they leave office. Preparation for such security takes time and can often overlap administrations. Permanent authority will allow for the development of long-term protection plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The upcoming change of administrations, not to mention the current threat level, makes permanent statutory authority for the Secret Service to provide such protections even more timely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5938">H.R. 5938</bill>, the "Former Vice President Protection Act of 2008." I would like to thank the Chair of the Judiciary Committee, Congressman Conyers, for introducing this bill and for providing leadership on this important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The former vice presidents of the United States have brought to that office significant public service experience, including as members of Congress or state governors. Some came to their role as president of the Senate already familiar with the body, having served as U.S. Senators. Several vice presidents later returned to serve again in the Senate, among them former President Andrew Johnson. Two vice presidents, George Clinton and John C. Calhoun, held the office under two different presidents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of the fourteen vice presidents who fulfilled their ambition by achieving the presidency, eight succeeded to the office on the death of a president, and four of these were later elected president. Two vice presidents, Hannibal Hamlin and Henry Wallace, were dropped from the ticket after their first term, only to see their successors become president months after taking office, when the assassination of Abraham Lincoln made Andrew Johnson president and the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt raised  Harry Truman to the presidency. Similarly, when Spiro Agnew resigned, he was replaced under the Twenty-fifth Amendment by Gerald R. Ford, who became president when Richard M. Nixon resigned less than a year later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The vice-presidency was generally held by men of mature years, with most of them in their fifties or sixties when they took office. The youngest, John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky, was thirty-six at the beginning of his term. At seventy-two, Alben Barkley, another Kentuckian, was the oldest when his term began.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because I recognize the importance of the vice-presidency and the pivotal role it plays in American politics, I believe that tribute, respect, honor, and protection should be afforded to the person, and the family, that has obtained this position. I am proud to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, Title 18 U.S.C. provides former Presidents and their spouses protection by the United States Secret Service after leaving office but provides no such protection for former Vice Presidents and their families. <bill type="h" number="5938">H.R. 5938</bill>, authorizes the United States Secret Service to protect the former Vice President of the United States, his/her spouse, and his/her children under the age of 17 for not more than six months after the Vice President leaves office. The bill would also allow protection  to continue should circumstances warrant extension.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901, Congress informally requested Secret Service presidential protection. A year later, the Secret Service assumed full-time responsibility for protection of the President. Today, the secret service, which is under the Department of Homeland Security, is tasked with protecting the President of the United States and spouse and children under 17 years old for up to ten years after serving in office. The Secret Service also provides protection  for widow(er) of the President and it provides protection for foreign heads of state and accompanying spouse when they visit the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To date, four presidents have been assassinated, and there have been approximately twelve other assassination attempts on U.S. presidents. Under current law, because of the prestige of the office of President, current and former Presidents are protected by the secret service. Former Vice Presidents have not received any protection from the secret service after the vice president's term in office had expired. This legislation would ensure that Vice Presidents get protection for as long as necessary.  Thus, the legislation ensures the safety and well-being of the Vice-President, spouse, and children under 17 years of age. This bill recognizes the important role of the office of Vice President. It is a powerful role with important responsibilities. This bill makes an important statement regarding our appreciation, commitment, and respect to the second most powerful position in this, our great country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this bill makes sense. It is reasonable in its scope and its terms. I am proud to support this bill and I urge my colleagues to do likewise.</paragraph>
