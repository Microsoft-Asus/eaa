    <paragraph>Madam President, I come to the floor briefly to speak about a bill I introduced today on the first day of this 110th Congress to signify its importance to our State and to speak about that for a moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But before I do, I want to give my public congratulations to the new leadership of this Chamber, to thank the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from Kentucky, the majority leader and the minority leader, for their gathering together of the Senators today, as the Presiding Officer also attended--a quite historic meeting of almost 100 of us in the Old Senate Chamber--and their commitment to us and to the Nation, although it was a private meeting, to work in a more collegial, cooperative way as  this Congress begins and to try to forge the bipartisan solutions I think our country called for as a reflection of the outcome of the last elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, for one, publicly want to commit myself to that endeavor and to work toward that end, as I continue to work across the aisle with many in the other party, and even Members such as the Presiding Officer in our own party, in the Democratic Party, to get the job done for our States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that regard, I introduced this bill today to authorize a project and to ask for special consideration for this very important levee and hurricane protection project in the State of Louisiana called Morganza to the Gulf. As today we look forward into what we are going to do with this new hope and new spring and new era of cooperation, that is terrific. But we also need to think about looking a little bit backward as to what we did not get done in the last Congress or the Congresses before so  we can pick up that work and move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This initiative, Morganza to the Gulf, would fall into that category of a project that was actually approved not only by the last Congress, the 109th Congress, but the 108th and the 107th, and started back actually decades ago. And because of just a few technical glitches resulting in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' failure to timely complete its report, the contingent authorization of the Morganza project expired. Eventually, the Corps submitted its report more than a year late and  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="202">S202</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, this project when completed will protect 120,000 people in south Louisiana, many of whom were devastated by two of the worst storms and subsequent flooding in the history of our country only 2 years ago, in 2005. However, these people are left vulnerable without this project being completed. It was part of a major WRDA bill, the Water Resources Development Act, of which this Congress worked together in quite an extraordinary bipartisan effort, as the Presiding Officer knows.  You have been a part of that effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It comes out of the EPW Committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee. Democrats on that committee and Republicans worked very hard, into the late hours of the night, trying to get that bill through. But for a number of reasons, this massive bill, with billions of dollars of projects, could not pass in the final hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this one project, of all of the projects in the Nation, I believe deserves special attention, not because it is in Louisiana, not because Senator Vitter and I represent this, and not only because our State received devastation from Katrina and Rita but because this is the one hurricane protection project that actually had been approved in the last WRDA bill. But because of untimeliness on the part of the Corps of Engineers, we could not get it authorized in the last bill, and it  should be first to be approved now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not know what is going to happen with our WRDA bill. I am certain the Senator from California, who has pledged her support, and the ranking member of that committee, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma, who is familiar with this, understand the special nature of this issue. Whether we can move this independently, I do not know. But I am going to ask. Until we are told no, we are going to try. Senator Vitter is not here to speak for himself, but I know he feels very strongly about  this, as indicated by his own actions and strong words he has put in the RECORD. Our House Members, both Republicans and Democrats, could make the same arguments on the House side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know people may be tired of seeing the Senators from Louisiana and Mississippi come down and talk about the gulf coast. But it is America's energy coast. It is a working coast. There are working people who live in real communities, large and small, whose homes have been devastated, whose churches have been destroyed, whose schools have been destroyed, and who still look to us to help them, to not waste their money or others' money in the relief but to spend it wisely and well and to provide  at least the Federal partnership for these hurricane protection levees. And that is what this is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The communities of Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, located in southeast Louisiana, which are the heart of America's energy coast, are willing and able to do their engineering, to put up their own money, to make sure that the projects are done in an expedited fashion. But they cannot begin without this Federal authorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I have introduced as stand-alone legislation, the Morganza to the Gulf of Mexico Hurricane Protection Project, as my first bill, to indicate the continued need throughout south Louisiana and the gulf coast for more protection from hurricanes and smart engineering, to say we are not going to stop asking for the things we think are most certainly meritorious of this Congress's attention and to continue to say that with all the challenges of housing, health care, education, small business recovery,  et cetera, that hurricane protection for levees and coastal restoration remains a constant need for the gulf coast and, I would predict, for other coasts around the country that need to wake up to the dangers of rising tides, surges from whatever, tsunamis on the west coast, hurricanes on the east coast, as a potential, and get serious about the business of stronger infrastructure and better planning about where and where not to build close to the coast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But again, these are working communities that are there--not sunbathing, not condos--running ports, laying pipelines, and giving the Nation the energy infrastructure it needs. These people, just like in the big cities of New Orleans and Baton Rouge and Lafayette and Lake Charles--these small communities of Houma and Lafourche and Cocherie and Golden Meadow and places that no one in Washington has ever heard of, but we visit all the time, deserve the protection of their Federal Government based  on what they contribute to the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I thank the Presiding Officer for letting me speak for the RECORD on this issue. I thank the leadership for giving me this time and commend it for the Senate to consider. Hopefully, we can pass it within the first weeks of this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
