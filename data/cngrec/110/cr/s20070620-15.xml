    <paragraph>Mr. President, on June 20, 1977--30 years ago to this day--oil began flowing through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. This event represents an important milestone in Alaska's history and a watershed moment in our struggle to secure America's energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My distinguished colleague from Alaska, Senator LISA MURKOWSKI, spoke at length about the history of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline before we adjourned last night. As she so vividly illustrated, its creation was a monumental undertaking which required the hard work of countless individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the long political fight to allow this important project to proceed, members of the environmental lobby claimed the pipeline would devastate Alaska. History has proven these critics wrong--responsible development and attentive stewardship have ensured the continued protection of our State's wildlife and lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even after the Arab oil embargo in 1973, the Senate remained closely divided on this matter. In fact, a tie vote on the authorizing legislation was not broken until Vice President Spiro Agnew cast the decisive vote in its favor. My own vote on that bill still ranks as one of the most memorable I have ever cast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When construction began in 1974, this project was the largest ever financed by private capital. Engineers faced staggering challenges as they plotted a route across 800 miles of rugged terrain and three major mountain ranges. Various geographic hurdles also necessitated the construction of seven airfields, dozens of bridges, and a 360-mile-long road to connect Prudhoe Bay to Fairbanks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just more than 3 years after construction started, however, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was ready to operate. Since then, more than 15.5 billion barrels of crude oil have been sent from Alaska's North Slope, through the pipeline to Valdez, and on to refineries throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The revenues generated by this production have had a tremendous impact in Alaska and throughout the United States. Over the past 30 years, North Slope oil production has added more than $300 billion to the U.S. economy and reduced domestic oil imports by more than $200 billion. Energy will always cost money, but instead of sending our dollars overseas, North Slope oil production--made possible by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline--has greatly contributed to economic growth here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Alaska, the economic effects of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline are even more apparent. Last year, revenues from oil production and transportation accounted for nearly 90 percent of the State government's total income--funds which were then used to help pay for our schools, our roads, and other important projects. North Slope oil revenue also provides the foundation for the permanent fund dividend, which will help assure the well-being of future generations of Alaskans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When oil began to flow through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in 1977, gasoline cost a mere 38 cents per gallon. Today, the nationwide average has soared to $3.00 per gallon, and many experts predict this price will reach $4.00 by the end of summer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As those of us in the Senate continue to debate a comprehensive energy policy for our Nation, we must take note of the consequences of 30 years of oil production in Alaska. Instead of the ecological disaster many predicted, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline has been an economic lifeline for our Nation. It continues to prove we can balance environmental concerns with the production of our natural resources. I urge my colleagues to heed this lesson.</paragraph>
