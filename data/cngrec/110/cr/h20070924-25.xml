    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill> extends the financing and spending authority of the Airport and Airway trust fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The trust fund taxes and spending authority are scheduled to expire on October 1, 2007. <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill> extends these taxes at current rates for 3 months. <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill> was unanimously reported out of the Ways and Means Committee with bipartisan support. This bill will keep the Airport and Airway trust fund taxes and operations in place until the long-term FAA Reauthorization Act is signed into law.</paragraph>

    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2007--As ordered reported by the House Committee on Ways and Means on September 18, 2007</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Summary: <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill> would extend, through the end of calendar year 2007, the existing taxes that are dedicated to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund and are set to expire on September 30, 2007. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that enacting <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill> would have no effect on revenues relative to the current baseline projection for taxes dedicated to the trust fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also would extend, through the end of calendar year 2007, the authority to expend amounts from the trust fund (including interest) for major programs administered by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). CBO estimates that implementing the bill would increase discretionary spending by $3.1 billion over the 2008-2012 period by authorizing appropriation of revenues expected to be collected during  the first three months of fiscal year 2008.  Enacting the bill would not affect direct spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JCT has determined that the bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Estimated costs to the Federal Government: The estimated budgetary impact of <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill> is shown in the following table. The costs of this legislation fall within budget function 400 (transportation).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Basis of estimate: For this estimate, JCT and CBO assume that <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill> will be enacted near the start of fiscal year 2008 and that appropriation actions consistent with the bill will be taken in fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The existing excise taxes that are dedicated to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund are scheduled to expire on September 30, 2007. The taxes consist of levies on transportation of persons and property by air, use of international air facilities, and use of aviation fuels and are estimated to generate revenues of over $11 billion in fiscal year 2007. The bill would extend all of the taxes at the current rate through the end of calendar year 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the projection rules in section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, which are followed for Congressional scorekeeping purposes, estimates of the revenue effects of the legislation assume that expiring excise taxes dedicated to a trust fund are extended indefinitely and are measured relative to a baseline that assumes that the expiring excise taxes are extended at the same rates that would be in place immediately before their scheduled expiration. As a result, JCT  estimates no change in revenue from the three-month extension in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By extending, through the first three months of fiscal year 2008, the authority to expend amounts from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, CBO estimates that the bill would authorize appropriations of the amounts that CBO estimates would be deposited in the fund during that three-month period--about $3.1 billion. Assuming appropriation action consistent with the bill, CBO estimates that implementing <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill> would increase discretionary spending by $3.1 billion over the 2008-2012 period. (If  the funding were authorized for the entire fiscal year, it would yield a total annualized amount of $12.4 billion.)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: JCT has determined that the bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Previous CBO estimate: On September 18, 2007, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for <bill type="h" number="3539">H.R. 3539</bill>, the Airport and Airway Trust Fund Financing Act of 2007, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Ways and Means on September 18, 2007. Differences in JCT's estimates of revenues result from provisions in <bill type="h" number="3539">H.R. 3539</bill> that would increase the excise tax rates on noncommercial aviation-grade kerosene and aviation gasoline. JCT also determined that increasing the tax rate on aviation-grade kerosene would  impose a private-sector mandate as defined in UMRA. In addition, CBO's estimate of discretionary spending under <bill type="h" number="3539">H.R. 3539</bill> reflects the four-year authorization contained in that bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Estimate prepared by: Federal Revenues: Barbara Edwards; Federal Spending: Megan Carroll.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Estimate approved by: Peter H. Fontaine, Assistant Director for Budget Analysis; G. Thomas Woodward, Assistant Director for Tax Analysis.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill>, the Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2007. As the gentleman, my colleague on the Ways and Means Committee, indicated, this bill is a 3-month extension of the excise taxes that currently fund the Airport and Airway trust fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Time is of the essence, as the Speaker knows, as these taxes are due to expire at the end of the month, and it is imperative that we do not cut off this source of funding that benefits our Nation's airports and the aviation community, as well as the tens of thousands of airline passengers. I see my colleague from Illinois nodding, and we shared a plane ride here moments ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, there has been a lot of discussion about a way to reformulate the way we fund the trust fund. There have been some interesting ideas bandied about by different points of view. This temporary extension allows us that additional time to consider some fundamental reforms to the tax structure that finances the Airport and Airway trust fund and to spend some more time studying the NextGen air traffic control modernization proposal before we move towards conference with the Senate to consider  FAA reauthorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman from Michigan pointed out, this bill was reported out of our committee by voice vote. Since it extends to the end of the calendar year the existing taxes dedicated to the trust fund, there is no effect on revenues as we extend the current baseline. I urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill>, the FAA Extension Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Rangel, Ranking Member McCrery, and my friends from Michigan and Missouri on the Ways and Means Committee, as well as the ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Mr. Mica, and Mr. Petri, the ranking member of the subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Thursday, the House passed <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill>, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007, a long-term authorization of the FAA programs. However, until <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> is signed into law, it is imperative that we not allow the FAA's critical programs to lapse. This legislation before us today would extend the aviation trust fund taxes for an additional 3 months at their current rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During our last funding debate 10 years ago, there was a lapse in the aviation taxes. At that time, the uncommitted balance of the trust fund was sufficient to continue funding our aviation program and services without significant disruption to the system. Today we do not have that luxury. The trust fund balances cannot sustain a long-term lapse in taxes, which is why it is critical that we pass this legislation before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to extending the aviation taxes, <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill> extends the Airport Improvement Program. Because the AIP is funded by contract authority rather than discretionary appropriations, funding for it is not automatically extended by continuing resolutions. <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill> creates $918.75 million in AIP contract authority to fund the programs for the next 3 months from October 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007. When annualized, this equates to $3.675 billion for the full fiscal year of 2008, which  is the current baseline level for this program. This will ensure that airport funding is not interrupted due to a lapse in the AIP authorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not the first time we have passed a short-term extension. In 1999 and 2000, as Congress was debating what eventually became the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, or AIR-21, we passed four extensions of the FAA's contract authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For FAA's operations, facilities and equipment, and research and development programs, the bill authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for a 3-month period of this extension.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, current law allows the Secretary to limit to $100 million the third-party liability exposure of airlines and aircraft manufacturers for any cause resulting from a terrorist event. This authority expires on September 30, 2007. The legislation before us today extends this authority to December 31 of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aviation is too important to our Nation's economy, contributing $1.2 trillion in output and approximately 11.4 million U.S. jobs. It is too important to allow for any lapse of taxes or funding for critical aviation programs. Until <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill> is signed into law, we must ensure that the FAA has the funds it needs to continue its vital programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill> provides a short 3-month extension to ensure FAA's programs remain fully funded, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Missouri.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, Members of this body considered and passed the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007, <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill>, which reauthorized the FAA for the next 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the authority of the FAA's programs and taxes expires this Sunday, September 30. As it is unlikely Congress will be able to send a FAA reauthorization bill to the President for signature before the September 30 deadline, we have before us <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill>, the Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2007, to extend the funding and expenditure authority of the FAA for the next 90 days through the end of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill> provides 3 months of AIP contract authority at the budget 2007 level, authorizes such sums as are necessary for FAA facilities and equipment, research and development, and operations for 3 months and extends the authority to limit the third-party liability of air carriers arising out of acts of terrorism for 3 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most importantly, the bill will ensure that our national aviation system continues to operate until a full FAA reauthorization can be enacted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is much work yet to be done on the reauthorization bill. We must work in a bipartisan and bicameral fashion to craft legislation that our President can sign. That's our task. That is what the communities involved and our constituents expect of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support this clean 3-month extension, and I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee for drafting and introducing <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill>, and look forward to working with them as we continue consideration of the FAA reauthorization bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill>, the "Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2007."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current authorization for aviation programs and taxes expires on September 30, 2007. Last week, the House overwhelmingly passed <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill>, the "FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007," to reauthorize the aviation programs for four years. Until this long-term reauthorization bill can be signed into law, there are a few critical provisions that must not be allowed to lapse at the end of this week. These important provisions are extended in <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill>, the bill before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support the extension of the aviation excise taxes as proposed in <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill>. These taxes are necessary to support the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which in recent years has provided about 80 percent of the Federal Aviation Administration's budget. With an uncommitted cash balance of less than $2 billion, any lapse in the aviation taxes could put the solvency of the Trust Fund at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to extending the aviation taxes, <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill> extends the Airport Improvement Program. Because the Airport Improvement Program is funded by contract authority, rather than discretionary appropriations, funding for it is not automatically extended by Continuing Resolutions. <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill> creates $918.75 million in Airport Improvement Program contract authority to fund the program for the three-month period from October 1, 2007, to December 31, 2007. This amount, when annualized, equals the  fiscal year 2007 amount for the program ($3.675 billion). This provision will ensure that airport funding is not interrupted because of a lapse in the Airport Improvement Program's authorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also authorizes the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for Federal Aviation Administration Operations, Facilities and Equipment, and Research and Development programs for the three-month period of the extension.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, current law allows the Secretary to limit to $100 million the third-party liability exposure of airlines and aircraft manufacturers for any cause resulting from a terrorist event. This authority expires September 30, 2007. <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill> extends this authority to December 31, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In summary, this bill simply continues aviation programs and financing under the same terms and conditions as current law. It ensures that these important programs continue to operate without any interruption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Chairman RANGEL and Ranking Member MCCRERY of the Committee on Ways and Means for working with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to include the aviation authorization provisions in <bill type="h" number="3540">H.R. 3540</bill>. I also thank my Committee colleagues, Ranking Member MICA, Subcommittee Chairman COSTELLO, and Subcommittee Ranking Member PETRI, for working with me on this critical legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to Senate passage of its long-term FAA reauthorization bill and sending a bill to the President in the coming months.</paragraph>
