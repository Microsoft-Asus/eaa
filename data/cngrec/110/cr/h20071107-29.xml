  <narrative>IMPEACH VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13216]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. KUCINICH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday I brought articles of impeachment before this House. The articles have been referred to the Judiciary Committee, and the people of the United States now have a chance to become engaged in a broad discussion about the importance of this action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People ask, why now? Well, recently, the administration asked for millions of dollars to be included in the defense budget to retrofit Stealth B-2 bombers with 30,000-pound bombs that can be used to bomb nuclear research labs in Iran at Natans and Bushir. Think of the humanitarian and ecological disaster that would come from that kind of a bombing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This administration, which took license to go to war based on lies, must be held accountable. And the Vice President must be held accountable for his role in bringing about the war against Iraq and in trying to beat the drums for a war against Iran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As has been pointed out here, we have so many needs here at home. We have people who are losing their homes, losing their pensions, losing their jobs, losing their health care, and we must bring discipline in this House to hold this administration accountable unto the law, so we can begin to focus on a domestic agenda and stop waging aggressive war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Impeach the Vice President.</paragraph>
