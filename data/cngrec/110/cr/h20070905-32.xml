    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="954">H.R. 954</bill>, which designates the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 365 West 125th Street in New York City as the Percy Sutton Post Office Building. This measure, which has the support of the New York delegation, was unanimously reported from our committee on July 19, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I have many remarks that I can make about Mr. Sutton, somebody that I don't know but read about as a young man growing up in, of all places, Massachusetts and then Vermont. But whatever I say is not worth listening to when we have another member of the New York delegation, remarkable in his own right, who actually knows Mr. Sutton and I expect is going to share some of his good qualities and be somewhat silent on anything else that may not be appropriate stories about the interactions  of these two terrific men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am going to reserve my time, and when the appropriate moment comes, allow the distinguished Member from New York to speak on behalf of the merits of Mr. Sutton, where he will be forever commemorated by having his name on a post office in the great city of New York.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Percy Sutton, a noted civil rights activist, lawyer and entrepreneur, has had numerous achievements in his lifetime. Today we honor Percy Sutton  with the naming of a post office in his hometown neighborhood of Harlem, New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in 1920 in San Antonio, Texas, he was the youngest of 15 children raised in a family with strong values in education. He found his niche at a young age with the Boy Scouts and rose to the rank of Eagle Scout. He attended Prairie View A&amp;M University, Tuskegee Institute and Hampton Institute, and he earned his law degree from Brooklyn Law School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a teenager, he learned to fly small planes and worked as a stunt pilot at county fairs. Upon the U.S. involvement in World War II, he enlisted with the Army Air Corps but was rejected because of his race. Shortly after, he moved to New York where he was accepted into the Corps and flew with the legendary Tuskegee Airmen. His military service awarded him Combat Stars as an intelligence officer with the 332nd Fighter Group's Black 99th Pursuit Squadron.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Percy Sutton gained national recognition during the 1950s and 1960s as a close friend and lawyer to civil rights leader Malcolm X. Sutton had moved to the Harlem area of Manhattan and formed his own law firm with the help of his brother and a close friend. The area, as well as his firm, quickly became associated with the civil rights movement and current politics of the era.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sutton ran unsuccessfully for public office, so he formed his own Democratic organization with other notable Harlem community leaders called the Harlem Clubhouse. He tried many cases during the 1960s defending the rights of many fellow African Americans in the Southern States. Still heavily interested in public service, he ran for and won an election to serve in the New York State Assembly in 1964.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His political career continued through the years and ended in the late 1970s. Over time and while still practicing law, he expanded his business by buying a radio station, the famous Apollo Theater, a local newspaper, and a cable television franchise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond his success in business, he has earned numerous awards for his charitable, civil rights and business achievements. Therefore, it is highly appropriate that we honor him with the naming of this post office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400333" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to support the naming of this post office on 125th Street after Percy Ellis Sutton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, 125th Street is the economic corridor of the village of Harlem. It is the exciting comeback of a community that is enjoying the creation of jobs through the Empowerment Zone. But it is also where our former President, Bill Clinton, has his offices and also one of the institutions that is driving it, the Apollo Theater. It is there because Percy Sutton brought it back from the ashes. So when tourists come and they see this wonderful new community that has come back, they will be  able to look at our post office and maybe ask the question, but who was Percy Sutton?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not too long ago, the President of the United States, George Bush, right here in the Capitol, gave the President's Congressional Gold Medal to the Tuskegee Airmen. My brothers and sisters, every day that we are fortunate enough to live in this great country, we fail to realize that we are making history, especially those of us who are honored to be elected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the House and Senate head toward getting the bill approved, with the help of Senator Levin on the other side, the President spoke to these people that sometime in 1941, black and as African American as they were, were denied the opportunity to join the United States Army Air Force in order to fight the enemies of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under great protest, they were allowed to try a pilot project in Tuskegee in order to see whether the outrageous charges that they were cowardly, that they couldn't learn, and they never would be able to manipulate these fighter pilots were true. And while they shattered all of the myths and turned out to be one of the most decorated outfits that survived World War II, the President, as he looked at them right here in Statuary Hall, reminded them that he knew that even though they became officers,  that many of the enlisted men refused to return the salutes to them because of prejudice, racism and discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the President said that, on behalf of the people of the United States of America, allow him to salute them. It was so moving. There wasn't a dry eye in the whole group as these warriors, these courageous fighter pilots that have done so much for this country, were able to hear the present Commander in Chief and President of the United States thank them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, in a way we are privileged by naming this post office not to be able to thank each and every one of the Tuskegee Airmen, but to thank at least one of them that comes from the village of Harlem, that you would say that our "thank you" may not be a salute from the Commander in Chief, but we are saying thank you for having confidence in this country and having confidence in this democracy and giving us a chance to honor Percy Sutton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He came back home, got involved in the NAACP, got involved in politics, became an assemblyman, became a borough president and became a well-known business person. But no matter what part of the United States you come from, we have to take time out to thank those of us who made the sacrifice, and Percy Sutton is one of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am glad that this committee has come together to pay tribute to him, because by doing this, we pay tribute to ourselves and for those people who we don't know their names but have made sacrifices, so that we could have the honor to serve this great country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers at this time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for a closing remark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Percy Sutton was the embodiment of the American Dream, and he did it as a man who grew up with the kind of prejudice that the chairman just alluded to. It is just an honor, I think, for all of us to have the kind of inspiration that a person like Percy Sutton has provided to our country, service in the military, and really the most decorated service unit in the whole war and accomplishing that against enormous obstacles. People didn't want them to serve, yet they did, and they had confidence  in us and our country despite the fact many in our country did not have confidence or even respect for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then his array of accomplishments in politics, as a civic leader, a commitment to this community. Harlem, which the chairman called a village, at many other times had really tough times, and this man had confidence that this community and the people in it had as much a future as any other American. He then acted with the skills that he possessed, the energy that he had, and made Harlem into what is now, a very vital community in the City of New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the Committee on Government Operations, with support from both sides of the aisle, is very proud to be bringing to the House for its full consideration the naming of this post office in honor of a great American.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote for <bill type="h" number="954">H.R. 954</bill>, a bill I introduced to designate the post office located at 365 West 125th Street in Harlem as the Percy Sutton Post Office Building. I express sincere thanks to Chairman HENRY WAXMAN and Ranking Member and Member TOM DAVIS of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform as well as Chairman DANNY DAVIS and Ranking Member KENNY MERCHANT of the Subcommittee on Federal Workforce Postal  Service, and District of Columbia for their support of this bill. It is appropriate to designate the post office in Mr. Sutton's honor because he worked at a New York post office as a clerk while attending law school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Percy Sutton, my very dear friend, was born the youngest of fifteen children on November 24, 1920 in San Antonio, Texas. His family owned land, a farm, and a funeral home. His entrepreneurial spirit was developed while working for the family businesses as a youngster. He was educated at Prairie View A &amp; M University, Tuskegee Institute, Hampton University, and Brooklyn College Law School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His career as a public servant began in 1941, when he was selected to work in Army Intelligence during World War II as a member of the Tuskegee Airmen. Just prior to that selection, he was not allowed to fly fighter planes for the Army Air Corps because of racial discrimination. Despite being subjected to racial discrimination, he was committed to serve his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After an honorable discharge from the Army, he decided to study law. To support himself while attending law school, he worked for the United States Post Office in New York as a clerk during the evening shift and later as a conductor in the New York City subway system. He maintained this schedule for 3 years. His dedication to finish law school still inspires me today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Motivated to fight racial discrimination, he represented the controversial revolutionary Malcolm X and other activists during the civil rights era. He also served as president of the New York chapter of the NAACP. His commitment to fight for justice and equality for African Americans was bold and admirable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A strong interest in politics led him to campaign for the New York State Assembly several times. Finally, in 1964, he was elected and served for two years. Immediately thereafter he became the president for the Borough of Manhattan and remained in that role until 1977.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an entrepreneur, his love of business and his Harlem community led him to purchase and totally revitalize the legendary Apollo Theatre in 1980. As the Harlem business district has flourished, the Apollo Theatre remains a community landmark and symbol. Another successful business venture he created is the Inner City Broadcasting Company, which housed the first African American owned radio station in New York. Today, there are nineteen radio stations in the Inner City network.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 29, 2007, I had the honor and privilege to see Percy Sutton honored with the Congressional Gold Medal along with over 300 other Tuskegee Airmen. It was a great day to see him and other African American veterans finally get the recognition that was so long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Percy Sutton is a great American and living legend. I'm certain America is a better place because of his contributions. Designating the post office building in Harlem is a great way to keep his legend alive for years to come. Since he is 86 years old and his health is fragile, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank my New York delegation colleagues for cosponsoring this bill.</paragraph>
