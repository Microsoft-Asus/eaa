    <paragraph>Madam President, when I was a young law student at Georgetown, the event that stands out the most in my memory was a morning that I and a few other young law students working at various agencies for the summer had with the then Attorney General. It was Attorney General Robert Kennedy. In that meeting, he stressed to us over and over again the professionalism of the Department of Justice and how the professionals had to stay out of any kind of partisan politics and that he would insist  upon it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was inspired by that meeting. I think it probably shaped my decision to go into public life more than any other single meeting I had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that an article in today's USA Today by Ronald Goldfarb entitled "Crossing the Line at Justice" be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
