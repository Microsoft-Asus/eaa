    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, over the past year, I have worked with colleagues in the House and Senate to achieve border security and comprehensive immigration reform without amnesty. I believe illegal immigration is a crisis that demands a national response, but amnesty is not that response.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From what we know about the recent compromise announced in the Senate, there are many commendable elements of the plan, including stronger border security measures and a shift to a merit-based immigration system. However, ultimately what has been dubbed a "grand bargain" is no bargain for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By permitting illegal immigrants to get right with the law without leaving the country, the Senate compromise amounts to amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants, and I cannot support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do hope to continue to work with colleagues in both parties in the House and Senate to craft final legislation that puts border security first, creates a temporary worker program without amnesty, that requires illegal immigrants to leave the country to apply, and, when they come, to learn English and live under the law when they are here.</paragraph>
