    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, later this week the liberal left in the House will take up the Defense Authorization Act, legislation that is supposed to make our Nation more secure and help our troops in winning the war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But you will have to excuse the American people if they don't understand the leadership's real agenda here, because you actually have to read through 452 pages of the National Defense Authorization Act to find it. Subtitle F, section 951 reveals all you really need to know: a significant diversion of national security resources to indulge the liberal fascination with global climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language paints an unwelcomed portrait of the liberal left's agenda on  national security: Wax philosophical about the so-called impact of global warming first and, only after that, talk about the real issue of the war on terror. This is the second time in as many weeks that the left plans to force this body to vote on a bill that would fund special interest priorities at the expense of our national security. It is unconscionable. It is unfair. It  is not right. It is an abusive use of Federal funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Welcome to national security, Democrat style.</paragraph>
