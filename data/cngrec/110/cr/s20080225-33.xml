  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="Introducing S. 2658. A bill to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to extend from 90 days to one year the period after release of a member from the Armed Forces from active duty during which the member is protected from mortgage foreclosure; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2658">S. 2658</bill>] Mr. President, in the Congress and in Washington these last years, there has been a tragic disconnect between the words spoken about keeping faith with those who wear the uniform of our country, and the actions actually taken to make those words count.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the tragic conditions at Walter Reed to the backlog of claims at the Veterans Administration, there has been a long list of problems unaddressed--and of problems that arose because someone, somewhere didn't plan ahead to prevent problems for those who sacrifice for all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we know from VA estimates that nearly 200,000 veterans are homeless on any given night and that nearly 400,000 veterans experience homelessness over the course of a year--a national disgrace to consider that in the richest country on the planet perhaps one out of every three homeless men sleeping in a doorway, alley or box once wore the uniform of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also know from the Bush administration's own U.S. Labor Department, that, for example, in 2006, the unemployment rate for young veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was 15 percent, more than triple the national average back then. We know that too many unemployed veterans are National Guard or Reserve troops who were called to duty but found when they came home that their old jobs were gone, that they'd lost their place in line in the local economy, or that the small businesses they'd  left behind to serve overseas were in dire straits when they came home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know these two challenges--the homeless rates for veterans and the unemployment numbers for veterans--demand big solutions, and we are working to provide them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we should also know by now that the least we can do is stop these problems from becoming worse. We have seen a wave of foreclosures send a ripple effect across the economy. By late 2007, 2.5 million mortgages were in default--a 40 percent increase from just 2 years earlier. Last month, foreclosures in Massachusetts alone were up 128 percent from the previous January. In fact, in 2007 alone 1.6 million Americans defaulted on their home loans, and as many as 3.5 million more are expected to  do the same by mid-2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every U.S. Senator would agree that the thought of our men and women in uniform being thrown out of their homes because of mortgage foreclosures is miles beyond unacceptable. The question is, in the middle of a national housing crisis and a subprime mortgage collapse, what can be done--done at a minimum--to ensure that Washington acts to shield veterans from becoming the faces of the foreclosure crisis, and from making today's Iraq and Afghanistan veterans the faces of tomorrows' homeless and  jobless populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that the soaring and staggering foreclosure statistics are directly affecting Americans from all walks of life, and our military is not exempt from the pain. The least we can do today is make it clear that we will pay some small measure of respect to veterans by helping them avoid foreclosure. They need more time and greater flexibility as they return to civilian life. The Commission on the National Guard and Reserves has urged us to take preventative action. The Commission found that  the transition from military to civilian life extends well beyond the current timelines which forces many service members to focus their attention on imminent foreclosure instead of first locating</paragraph>
    <paragraph>a competitive job or addressing any mental or physical health concerns that they may be facing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why today I am introducing commonsense legislation that would protect servicemembers and veterans involved in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan by securing a longer grace period for payment. My bill would extend the time from 90 days to 1 year the time period that a servicemember is protected from foreclosure. By extending the deadline to 1 year, I hope we can take one small step to prevent future homelessness throughout the veteran's community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If America's leaders truly support our troops, we owe them more than a polite thank you and best wishes. We owe them action. We cannot tolerate a pattern in Washington that has persisted for too long--provide lip service about supporting the troops but not the lifesaving body armor they need; talk a good game about veterans but cut funding for their healthcare. It is wrong, and it is time for it to end. We should act now to ensure that those saddled with the burden of the mortgage crisis are  not those who have carried the greatest responsibility for America overseas in the fight for freedom. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400357" topic="Introducing S. 2660. A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to ensure that the mission and functions of Regional Transmission Organizations and Independent System Operators include keeping energy costs as low as reasonably possible for consumers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2660">S. 2660</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help protect consumers from high electricity prices that have followed deregulation of electricity markets. I am honored to have many of my colleagues joining me in offering this legislation--Senator SNOWE, Senator KERRY, Senator COLLINS, Senator KENNEDY, and Senator LEAHY. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Market pricing of electricity promised to bring lower costs to consumers. Unfortunately, consumers in organized market regions--those that have a Regional Transmission Organization or  Independent System Operator, RTOs or ISOs as they are called--are experiencing just the opposite: substantial, across-the-board problems with spiraling costs, unaccountable governance, and a chronic lack of oversight. Increasingly, RTOs/ISOs are adopting questionable, unproven,  and expensive market mechanisms, and there seems to be little interest at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, or the RTOs/ISOs to question any of the economic theories behind these mechanisms. I note that on February 21, 2008, FERC finally took a step toward</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The goal of lowering costs to consumers has been lost in the race to create competitive electricity markets. In fact, something as simple as keeping costs to consumers as low as reasonably possible is not even part of the mandate, or mission statement, of any of the Nation's ISOs or RTOs! In New England, we have seen what can happen--there have been several instances in which ISO-New England has implemented expensive market mechanisms, over the objection of significant segments of electric stakeholders,  without either conducting a cost-benefit analysis or comparing the costs of the proposed initiative with alternative means of achieving the desired results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Showing the strong interest in this issue in the New England region, the legislation is supported by the Northeast Public Power Association, the Vermont Public Power Supply Authority, the Burlington Electric Department, Kennebunk Light &amp; Power District, the Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Company, Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative, the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel, and the Pascoag Utility District. The Ohio Consumers' Counsel, the Maryland Office of People's  Counsel, Electricity Consumers Resource Council, and the Utility Consumers' Action Network support the legislation as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation I am introducing today would refocus FERC on the consumer cost impacts of RTO/ISO actions. Consistent with existing law, the bill makes explicit that, when FERC considers the lawfulness of RTO/ISO rates, it must assess whether those rates will ensure that consumer costs are as low as reasonably possible consistent with the provision of reliable service. Also, in recognition of the uniquely important roles played by RTOs and ISOs, this bill requires FERC to make both goals--cost  minimization and reliability--a part of each RTO or ISO's mission. These changes clarify and amplify existing law as applied to these important organizations, but do not alter, diminish, or imply an absence of similar requirements with respect to other public utilities regulated by FERC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe these simple, commonsense issues, when posed by FERC to an RTO/ISO that is seeking approval for a rate, charge, or rule, will instill a much stronger sense of cost accountability. The bottom line, as I see it, is that this simple bill will likely yield substantial benefits for consumers and for many regional economies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in pushing for adoption of the Consumer Protection and Cost Accountability Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="Introducing S. 2661. A bill to prohibit the collection of identifying information on individuals by false, fraudulent, or deceptive means through the Internet, a practice known as &quot;phishing&quot;, to provide the Federal Trade Commission the necessary authority to enforce such prohibition, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2661">S. 2661</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that focuses on eliminating online fraud and identity theft that is facilitated through the use of phishing schemes, as well as deceptive and misleading domain names. Phishing is a method of online identity theft that takes the form of fraudulent e-mails or fake Web sites in order to deceive the recipient into giving personal or financial account information. In addition to victimizing unsuspecting consumers, phishing scams maliciously  exploit the trust that legitimate businesses have worked so hard to establish with consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Anti-Phishing Consumer Protection Act of 2008 would prohibit the practice of phishing--the deceptive solicitation of a consumer's personal information through the use of e-mails, instant messages, and misleading Web sites that trick recipients into divulging their information to identity thieves. The legislation would also prohibit related abuses, such as the practice of using fraudulent or misleading domain names, by defining them as deceptive practices under the FTC Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the legislation seeks to solidify the integrity of domain name registration, a longtime goal for the Federal Trade Commission, by making it illegal for a domain name registrant to provide false or misleading identifying contact information in a WHOIS database when registering a domain name. Too often law enforcement officials have been hindered in their pursuit of phishers and other online scams  because the person responsible is hiding  behind the anonymity of false registration information--this legislation would put an end to that practice by requiring accurate registration information about those that own Web sites and domain names that are used to harm consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason it is imperative to address this through legislation is because online fraud and, more specifically, phishing scams are running rampant. A December 2007 New York Times article reported that more than 3.5 million Americans lost money to phishing schemes and online identity theft over a 12-month period ending in August 2007--this is a 57-percent increase over the previous year. The total amount lost by the victims, $3.2 billion dollars. The Anti-Phishing Working Group found, in November  2007, that 178 corporate identities and brands were hijacked and used for phishing scams, which is the highest number ever reported. All of these figures are very disconcerting and will only increase if we don't put greater effort on curtailing this online fraud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Phishing and other forms of identity theft continue to have a detrimental effect on e-commerce by eroding consumers' confidence in online transactions. According to a 2007 Javelin Strategy &amp; Research study, 80 percent of Internet users are concerned about being victims of online identity theft. What is more, a 2006 Zogby Interactive poll found that 78 percent of small business owners polled stated that a less reliable Internet would damage their business. While consumer confidence is critical  in any commerce activity, it is paramount for online transactions. Phishing and other online fraud activities directly undermine that vital trust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Phishing schemes aren't just isolated to individuals and e-commerce. Companies, organizations, and government agencies are also targets. A form of phishing known as spear phishing targets these entities to gain unauthorized access to the organization's computer system in order to steal financial information, trade secrets, or even top-secret military information. The security risks that phishing poses in the world of cyberterrorism is very significant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But one doesn't have to look to some distant country to find the origin of traditional phishing schemes. The United States only until recently was consistently the top country that hosted the most phishing Web sites. While China now holds that claim, the United States is a very close second--hosting approximately 24 percent of phishing Web sites. So we can definitively do more within our borders to make the Internet notably safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since President Bush signed the stimulus package into law earlier this month, millions of Americans will be expecting to receive tax rebate checks this May. But before those checks arrive, taxpayers should also expect to be targets of numerous phishing schemes between now and then. Many of these scams involve official-looking e-mail messages that try to trick the recipient into entering their personal information at a fake IRS Web site by stating in the e-mail that they are eligible for a refund  check. This is not the first time the IRS identity has been misused for phishing scams, and it will continue if we don't do more to go after phishers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this is what the Anti-Phishing Consumer Protection Act of 2008 does. It looks to make the Internet safer and more reliable. It also facilitates the restoration of trust and consumer confidence that has been eroded by the prevalence of deceptive e-mails and Web sites, which has, in part, mired the Internet from achieving its full potential. That is why I sincerely hope that my colleagues join Senators BILL NELSON, STEVENS, and me in supporting the critical legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="Introducing S. 2662. a bill to respond to a Medicare funding warning; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2662">S. 2662</bill>] Mr. President, under a provision of the 2003 Medicare bill, the Medicare trustees are required to determine the point at which general revenues will finance at least 45 percent of Medicare's total outlays. If for 2 consecutive years, the trustees predict that this 45 percent threshold will be exceeded in the next 6 years, they are required to issue a "Medicare Funding Warning," which they did last April. As a result, the law requires the President to submit and Congress to receive  a legislative proposal to reduce general revenues as a share of total Medicare spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> The President has now submitted proposed legislation to Congress in response to the funding warning, and I am therefore required to introduce the President's proposal. So today, Senator Gregg and I will introduce a bill to respond to a Medicare funding warning. But I do so while emphasizing that the President's proposal, contained in this very bill, is not the answer to the Medicare program's problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Everyone agrees that Medicare faces a serious long-term financing problem that must be addressed. But the challenge facing Medicare is not what share of its funding comes from general revenues--the problem is rising health care costs in the health care system as a whole. Medicare's costs are increasing because costs throughout the health care system are skyrocketing. Addressing the causes of these system-wide costs will be the key to addressing Medicare's long-term financing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> With health care costs increasing much faster than wages and inflation, Congress must find ways to control these rising costs in order to ensure the long-term financial viability of the Medicare program. We must also address current Medicare policies--such as overpayments in the Medicare Advantage program--that exacerbate the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> While I am statutorily required to introduce the President's Medicare bill at this time, I still fully intend to pursue real Medicare reform legislation in the coming weeks. That bill will increase access to preventive benefits and primary care, and will improve the quality of care delivered under the program. I will also seek to help low-income seniors with the costs of rising Medicare premiums, and to offer timely, appropriate improvements for the prescription drug benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Beyond advancing a more realistic Medicare reform bill this year, I also intend for the Finance Committee to launch an aggressive look at comprehensive health care reform. Working together, my colleagues and I will examine the underlying causes of rising health care costs in the entire health care system and explore solutions that can be the foundation for system-wide reform--the only way truly to control costs in the Medicare program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> I am required by law to introduce the White House's legislation on Medicare today, but I am compelled by my commitment to America's seniors to insist on better solutions. Where the President's bill cobbles together ill-conceived or premature proposals to check the box on curbing Medicare costs, I intend for the Senate to consider a carefully crafted, thoughtful package of real improvements to the Medicare program overall--and to spend the rest of this year preparing for a time when real health  reform is within our grasp. Working together, we can do better by America's seniors.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300018" topic="Introducing S. 2665. A bill to extend the provisions of the Protect America Act of 2007 until July 1, 2009; read the first time.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the issues of housing are very much on the minds of the American people and those of us in Congress. While we focus on the challenges that homeowners currently are facing, we must not fail to recognize that there are a lot of families that dare not dream of owning their own home; they dream simply of having access to safe, affordable rental housing in our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Today, I am pleased to introduce the Affordable Housing Investment Act, a bill that will update and modernize the low-income housing tax credit program--a program that we all know has been tremendously successful in helping construct needed affordable housing in communities across our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> We often find ourselves reacting to Government programs that are broken; this bill is about a Government program that works but can be improved upon. The low-income housing tax credit program was created as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and made permanent in 1993. Designed as a public/private funding partnership, largely administered by the States, this program has become the most successful housing production program in existence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> These tax credits make it attractive for investors to forego highly profitable luxury residences, in order to provide housing for those most in need. Without affordable housing, many low-income Americans would find themselves on the street. Instead, these families can provide shelter to their children and have a secure place to live near where they work and go to school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> State agencies award housing tax credits to housing developers, who turn the credits into construction funds by selling them to investors. There funds allow developers to borrow less money and pass through the savings in lower rental rates for low-income tenants. Investors, in turn, receive a 10-year tax credit based on the cost of constructing or rehabilitating apartments that cannot be rented to anyone whose median income is higher than 60 percent of the median income in the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Each State's annual housing credit allocation is capped. In 2007, the cap is $1.95 per capita, with a minimum of $2.275 million. States put each development through three separate, rigorous evaluations to make sure it receives only enough housing credits to make it viable as low-income housing for the long term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Since its inception, this program has created nearly 2 million homes for low-income families at restricted rents for terms of at least 30 years--housing that would not have occurred without the tax credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> The credit is responsive to the needs of local communities. It works for new construction, rehabilitation, and preservation of affordable housing. It works in cities, suburbs, and rural areas. It revitalizes low-income communities. It serves families, the elderly, the disabled, and the homeless. Each State sets its own housing priorities, and developers compete aggressively to meet these priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> The program is cost efficient and has a high compliance rate. The marketplace imposes discipline on the program so that taxpayers' dollars are well-spent. Investors receive their tax credits only if housing is built on time and on budget, operates successfully within local housing markets, and is well maintained over time. The annual failure rate for housing credit properties is 0.02 percent annually, well below that for other housing or commercial real estate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> As successful as the housing tax credit program is, it could benefit significantly from updating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> The Affordable Housing Investment Act of 2008, which I am introducing with Senators Smith, Kerry, Coleman and Salazar, modernizes the tax credit rules in order to make it even more useful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> First, it eliminates the penalties for combining housing credits with other Federal housing programs. The bill proposes to remove various restrictions that make it hard to coordinate housing credits with other Federal policies and programs. These restrictions frustrate efforts to address local needs and add unnecessary legal and accounting costs. In some cases, these restrictions were set many years ago to prevent properties from receiving excessive subsidies. Such restrictions are no longer  needed because States examine each project at three points to ensure that it needs the amount of housing credits allocated to it. In addition, the high demand for housing credits and other subsidies motivates all subsidy providers to limit subsidies to the minimum amount necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Second, the bill helps foster low-income community revitalization by facilitating the construction of child care, primary health care, recreation and other community service facilities and aiding with the specific needs for housing in rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Third, the bill preserves existing affordable housing by easing restrictions on rehabilitation of older properties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Finally, the bill eliminates unneeded inefficiencies in the tax laws that serve no public policy purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> The legislation has been endorsed by the National Council of State Housing Agencies, the Affordable Housing Tax Credit Coalition, the Housing Development Consortium, Local Initiatives Support Corporation and Impact Capital, National Association of State and Local Equity Funds, Seattle Housing Authority, and the Washington State Housing Finance Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> The tax credit program may be invisible to the people that now have a roof over their head, but it is indispensable to our ability to meet the growing demand--and diminishing supply--for affordable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> For example, Port Orchard Vista--a 42-unit apartment building for low-income seniors--would not have been built without the tax credit program. One resident, a 62-year-old grandmother named Jackie, would be homeless if this project had not been built. Jackie's Social Security check is $600 per month. Her rent was $605, not including utilities--or groceries! She was selling her furniture and her mom's old  cookbooks to make up the difference. She was  just a few months away from being homeless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Thanks to the tax credits, the Kitsap County Consolidated Housing Authority was able to get this project built and keep Jackie off the street. Today, Jackie's rent is $200--including utilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> The Village at Overlake Station in Redmond, Washington, was built in 2001 and offers beautiful public spaces and apartment homes. Sarah, a single mother, came to Overlake Station in late 2005 after spending that summer and fall living out of her vehicle with her two children. She was extremely grateful to find a suitable, affordable apartment before the cold weather came. She and her children were forced to huddle together in the backseat of her car to stay warm as they slept and she was concerned  about their safety. Though she tried to be cautious, she just knew she should find a better way to take care of her children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Sarah and her children have proudly lived at Overlake for 2 years. Soon they will move into a new house, thanks to Habitat for Humanity. In two years, Sarah has gone from homelessness to homeownership--thanks to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> These stories can be replicated in every community in my State and across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> In 2002, the Millennial Housing Commission said in its final report to the Congress:</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Securing access to decent, affordable housing is fundamental to the American Dream. All Americans want to live in good-quality homes they can afford without sacrificing other basic needs. All Americans want to live in safe communities with ready access to job opportunities, good schools, and amenities. All parents want their children to grow up with positive role models and peer influences nearby. And the overwhelming majority of Americans want to purchase a home as a way to build wealth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> By leveraging private capital to build affordable housing units, we are also helping our local communities. People left with no affordable housing options join the ranks of the homeless and then become the responsibility of our cash-strapped communities. We can alleviate some of the community responsibilities of caring for the homeless, the disabled, and other vulnerable low-income families by helping to provide these people an affordable place to call home. I encourage my colleagues to join  me in this effort.</paragraph>
