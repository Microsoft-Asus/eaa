  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to mark the enactment of the Americans With Disabilities Act amendments Act, <bill type="s" number="3406">S. 3406</bill>. Passed with overwhelming, bipartisan support in the Senate and House of Representatives, this important bill was signed into law this week. I am proud and honored to celebrate the occasion with my colleagues, particularly Senator Harkin and Senator Hatch, who worked so hard to craft the legislation and help guide it through Congress. The disability, civil rights,  and business stakeholders behind this legislation deserve our recognition as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are all part of a nation built on the promise of equal rights, justice, and opportunity for everyone. Eighteen years ago, we took a historic step toward fulfilling that promise with the passage of the original Americans with Disabilities Act. Unfortunately, we didn't expect then that Supreme Court decisions would narrow the law's scope contrary to congressional intent. As a result, the lower courts have now gone so far as to rule that people with amputation, muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, diabetes,  multiple sclerosis, cancer, and even intellectual disabilities are not disabled. The Supreme Court decisions further imposed an excessively strict and demanding standard to the definition of disability, although Congress intended the ADA to apply broadly to fulfill its purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ADA Amendments Act finally rights these wrongs. For one, the new law directs the courts toward a broader meaning and application of the ADA's definition of disability. More major life activities will also be included in the definition of disability, so that more people with disabilities will be covered by the ADA. The amendments further clarify that the ADA covers people who use "mitigating measures," such as medications or prosthetics, to treat their conditions or adapt to their disability.  Otherwise, they will continue to be in a catch-22 that forces them to choose between managing their disabilities or staying protected from job discrimination. No one should have to make that choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to the newly enacted amendments, the ADA's focus can return to where it should be--the question of whether the discrimination occurred, not whether the person with a disability is eligible in the first place. Simply put, the ADA Amendments Act restores the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act to the civil rights law it was meant to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we cannot rest on our laurels as we look ahead to the future. Today we reaffirm the principle that discrimination based on disability doesn't belong in the workplace, but we cannot ignore the low employment rates for people with disabilities who want to work. They want to achieve to the best extent of their potential and enjoy economic self-sufficiency, but this piece of the American dream remains just beyond their reach. Clearly, there is still much work to be done if our Nation  is to realize the ADA's vision of full inclusion and acceptance of all people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let us renew our commitment to the goals and ideals of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I look forward to continuing this effort on behalf of the American people, including all those in Nevada and throughout the country celebrating the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act.</paragraph>
