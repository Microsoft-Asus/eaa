  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - July 07, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="6343">S6343</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, following leader remarks, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 3 p.m. Senators will be permitted therein to speak for up to 10 minutes each.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know the two managers of the housing bill plan on being here on or about that time. As I have indicated, the Senate will resume consideration of the House message that accompanies <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, housing reform legislation, under a previous order. At 5:30 p.m. today, the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the motion to concur with respect to the housing reform legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before we left for the Fourth of July recess, we were able to reach an agreement on FISA legislation. We will debate the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have spoken to the distinguished Republican leader today. We are going to try to get an agreement--I feel very comfortable that we can--and we will complete all the debate tomorrow. There are a number of Senators proceeding to North Carolina for the funeral of Senator Helms. So they could spend whatever time is necessary to be in North Carolina and not feel pressed on coming back, we are going to try to do the votes Wednesday morning. I think that will work out just fine for everyone's schedule.  We will debate the bill then tomorrow afternoon; tomorrow night, we have 7 hours set aside. We may even leave a little time for Wednesday morning. We will see how that goes. Whatever I do will have to be with the agreement of the Republican leader; otherwise, we finish everything tomorrow night and no one thinks that would be appropriate. Senators will be notified as soon as this is worked out. We will try to have a unanimous consent agreement on that at the earliest possible time today.</paragraph>
