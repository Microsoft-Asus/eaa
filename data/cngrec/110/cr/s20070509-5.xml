    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning, there will be 60 minutes for morning business, with the Republicans controlling the first half, and the Democrats controlling the second half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the FDA legislation. Last night, due to the hard work of Senator Enzi and the staffs of Senators Kennedy and Enzi, they were able to come to an agreement to complete action on this legislation today. I compliment the hard work of the many individuals who worked to accomplish this, especially Senator Brown who, in the absence of the chairman, was here throughout the day to assist in moving the  process along. In addition, I would like to single out Senator Enzi, who has worked so hard on this legislation in the committee and, of course, with it being on the floor. He has worked very well with Senator Kennedy in the entire process of getting this legislation through the committee to the floor and now toward completion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the hard work of these I have mentioned, we have only three amendments that are in order to the bill, and we have 60 minutes of debate time. Votes on the remaining amendments and passage of the bill will occur around 11:30 this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following final action on the FDA bill, the Senate will consider, for up to 3 hours, the nomination of Debra Ann Livingston to be a circuit court judge. Upon the use or yielding back of that time, then a vote on confirmation will occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once the judge has been confirmed, I have every belief that the Senate will begin and complete the process of going to conference on the budget resolution. I have spoken to Senator Conrad earlier this morning. He and Senator Judd Gregg get along extremely well, and they will work out the time on the number of motions to instruct and how many motions to instruct the minority will require. So Members should be prepared to work into the evening on this most important item.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the water resources legislation will not occur before tomorrow morning. Today will be a busy day, with votes occurring throughout the day, so Members should plan accordingly.</paragraph>
