  <narrative>COMMEMORATING CJ MARTIN'S BIRTHDAY AND IN SUPPORT OF CJ'S HOME PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 19, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8125]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the birthday of CJ Martin. I say commemorate because he would celebrate his fourth birthday tomorrow. Instead, CJ was taken from his family and our community by a killer F-3 tornado that struck his great grandmother's home in Eastbrook manufactured housing community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CJ and the other 24 victims might have been saved had they only had a warning that they needed to protect themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I was the sheriff of Vanderburgh County when this tornado hit. I saw firsthand the devastation that it caused and what severe weather can bring to the families and the communities that they touch. That experience resulted in my introduction of CJ's Home Protection Act, <bill type="h" number="2787">H.R. 2787</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill simply requires manufactured homes to come equipped with life-saving NOAA weather radios. Like a smoke detector, these inexpensive devices can provide families with the warning they need to take action and protect themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, as we remember CJ's birthday, I encourage my colleagues to honor his life by cosponsoring this important public safety measure.</paragraph>
