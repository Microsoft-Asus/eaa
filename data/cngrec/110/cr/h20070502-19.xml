    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday the majority party sent a plan for failure in the war on terror to the President, and the President did the right thing. He sent it right back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's now time for Congress to pass a funding bill that supports our troops and doesn't undermine their mission. The political maneuvering done by the majority over the last 2 1/2  months has done nothing, nothing, but delay the delivery of tools and resources to our troops in the field, while outlining a very specific and dangerous blueprint for defeat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's stop wasting time. Let's stop trying to rewrite the Constitution and the role of the Commander in Chief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a choice. The majority can continue to play these partisan games, or we can get down to work. We have that choice. The brave men and women in our Armed Forces do not. Let's honor their sacrifice with leadership rather than political partisanship. The American people are watching, and so are our allies and our enemies around the world. We have a choice.</paragraph>
