  <narrative>NOMINATION OF JUDGE MICHAEL MUKASEY -- (Senate - October 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12948">S12948</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased the Judiciary Committee will begin hearings this morning on the nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be the Nation's 81st Attorney General.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Mukasey has outstanding qualifications and a sterling reputation. Throughout four decades, he selflessly devoted his life to public service, culminating in his selection as Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a jurist, Judge Mukasey handled complex legal problems judiciously, thoughtfully, and fairly. The complex problems that face the Justice Department merit similar serious treatment, and I am confident that were he to be confirmed, Judge Mukasey will bring his trademark qualities to bear in analyzing them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Analyzing these problems requires a careful and deliberative process. It is a process that starts today, and it will continue after the Judiciary Committee's hearings are over. It is a process that does not lend itself to snap judgments or snap answers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Mukasey will not abandon his trademark qualities of judiciousness and thoughtfulness today, nor should we want him to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be injudicious and unthoughtful for Judge Mukasey to make snap judgments about particular outcomes on highly complex and highly sensitive policies in the war on terror before he even gets into office. Judge Mukasey is not read into some of these programs, and is not, at the present time, fully familiar with others. Even if he were fully familiar with them, it would be imprudent for him to discuss their classified features in open sessions while our enemies are watching.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate Judiciary Committee should be mindful of the complex problems that Judge Mukasey is being called on to solve, as well as the constraints under which he is operating. And it should treat him fairly. If he is treated fairly, I am confident the committee will report him to the floor for a prompt up-or-down vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The majority leader is recognized.</chair>
