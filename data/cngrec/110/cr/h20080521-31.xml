  <narrative>SUPPLY AND DEMAND -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H4329]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400655" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the New York Times today has got an article predicting $200 a barrel for crude oil in the not-too-distant-future. The laws of supply and demand, the economic law of supply and demand works. This House, led by this majority, has passed bill after bill after bill whose intent and whose implication is to increase the costs to generate energy, whether its electricity or gasoline. Those policies specifically demand higher prices. If there was a cheaper way to generate electricity  or drive our cars, we would already be using those cheaper methods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the policies are to raise the prices, and the twisted logic is they then come down here and speaker after speaker gripes and complains about those exact high prices, which is the direct result of what their policies are putting in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, in a staggering twist of illogic, is to pass, as a part of that bill that was passed yesterday, to unleash our Department of Justice on the very producers that we are trying to incent to produce more crude oil and natural gas on an unfettered witch hunt that will cost millions and millions of dollars and result in absolutely zero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's wrong policy. The American people need to speak up.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
