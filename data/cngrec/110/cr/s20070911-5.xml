  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - September 11, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11355">S11355</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning, following any remarks of Senator McConnell and myself, the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the Transportation Appropriations bill. There are no votes presently scheduled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night, there were discussions about the possibility of the Republicans offering an amendment on the subject of Mexican trucks, which is the subject of the pending Dorgan amendment. We are all hopeful we can work something out on that this morning regarding the Dorgan amendment and the so-called alternative amendment to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding Senator Coburn is going to arrive about 10:30 this morning to start offering amendments on problems he has with this legislation. As I mentioned last night, he tends not to speak for long periods of time, but he does have a number of amendments. He hasn't decided how many that will be. We hope we can proceed on that as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At 12 noon today, the Senate will observe a moment of silence in commemoration of the sixth anniversary of the September 11 attack. Both the Republican leader and I encourage Members to come to the floor for this observance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, the Senate will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 for the regular party conference meetings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, I indicated that today would be a late night as we work toward completing this legislation. There is no reason we can't complete this bill tonight. If we complete it tonight, of course, there will be no votes tomorrow. As indicated, there would be no votes after 1 o'clock anyway, so we should do our best to complete this legislation tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It could be a very late night, but we have two of our most competent, experienced legislators doing this bill--Senator Murray and Senator Bond--and we do hope we can move forward on this legislation.</paragraph>
