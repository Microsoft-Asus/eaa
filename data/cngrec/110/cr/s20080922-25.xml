    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to call the attention of the Senate to the 40th anniversary of the leading Latino litigation, advocacy, community education, and outreach organization in the United States. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, MALDEF, celebrates 40 years of  protecting and promoting the civil rights of Latinos in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>MALDEF'S service to the Latino community is exemplary; they utilize multiple strategies to foster sound public policies, laws, and programs that secure the civil rights of Latinos. Their work on employment, education, immigration, political access, language, and public resource equity issues is pivotal to the advancement and progress of the Latino community in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over its rich 40-year history, MALDEF has been led by some of the best and brightest Hispanic leaders who paved the way for excellence in nonprofit leadership. Thanks to the fine leadership of Mario Obledo, MALDEF's first president and general counsel; Antonia Hernandez, who served MALDEF for 23 years; and John Trasvi&#xF1;a, MALDEF's current president and general counsel, we have much to celebrate. MALDEF's leadership is heard throughout the nation from their headquarters in Los Angeles, to  San Antonio, Chicago, Washington, DC, Houston, and Sacramento.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During these especially hard times for our Latino brothers and sisters, when the anti-immigrant sentiment is at its highest, MALDEF has been fighting to challenge breaches in voting rights, workplace discrimination, access to justice, and educational access. In 2006, MALDEF went before the U.S. Supreme Court and successfully challenged a congressional redistricting plan that discriminated against Latino voters in Texas. Most recently, MALDEF won a case that will require the Texas Education Agency  to fix the State's English Language Learner, ELL, programs in secondary schools and restore educational equity for our Latino students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund for their 40-year commitment to the Hispanic community. Their record of legal representation, advocacy, and educational outreach has indisputably improved the quality of life and opportunities of all Latinos in the U.S. It is through the hard work of organizations like MALDEF that we will be able to overcome social and economic inequalities faced by Americans of different ethnic and racial backgrounds.</paragraph>
