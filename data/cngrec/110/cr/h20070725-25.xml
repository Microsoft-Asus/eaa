    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support this morning of the funding levels included in the State and local law enforcement in <bill type="h" number="3093">H.R. 3093</bill>. This legislation reverses a dangerous downward trend in the Community Oriented Policing Services program, the COPS program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, it increases the COPS budget to $725 million, which is a $183  million increase over last year. It also includes $80 million in additional money for the Byrne grant system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was the sheriff in Seattle up until 2 1/2  years ago for the last 8 years of my career. I was in law enforcement 33 years. As a sheriff, I used the Byrne Grant funds. I used the COPS money. We worked together with our communities. We worked together with business. We made our communities safe. It is a vital program, a useful program, a necessary program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we cannot have freedom, we cannot feel safe in our neighborhoods until we know we are safe, until we know our law enforcement is there to protect us. The COPS grant does that.</paragraph>
