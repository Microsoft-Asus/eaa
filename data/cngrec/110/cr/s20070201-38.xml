    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing 100 years of groundbreaking research and education at the University of California Riverside's Citrus Research Center--Agricultural Experiment Station. This year, the university celebrates a century of improving our Nation's agriculture, environment, and natural resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The idea behind the creation of a citrus experiment center began with the pioneering work of Riverside citrus grower John Henry Reed, who first proposed the idea in 1900. At the time Riverside was the hub of a rapidly expanding citrus industry, in part because refrigeration made nationwide shipments possible. His proposal became a reality in 1905 when the California Legislature passed a measure authorizing the establishment of the Citrus Experiment Station in Riverside. By 1907, the Citrus Experiment  Station became an open branch of the Statewide Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From that time on, the Citrus Experiment Station continued to grow and develop, to become one of California's premier agricultural research institutions. In 1914, the station maintained a staff of 18 with an annual budget of $60,000. Over the next 40 years, the Experiment Station's research area grew from 30 acres to almost 1,000 acres, and staff grew to 265.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During that time, Leon D. Bachelor, as director, worked to initiate many of the long-term fertilizer experiments and worked to ensure the strength of the walnut industry through disease research. During his tenure, shipping and processing of produce was vastly improved, and improvements were implemented in citrus rootstocks, disease resistance, and fruit quality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this was taking place, facilities and physical plant construction continued to increase as more research stations and research buildings were being built. In 1954 Weber Hall was constructed, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Boyden Entomological Laboratory was built in 1961, and research property increased to 1,100 acres. There were also advances in research focus, beginning in 1955 with the arrival of a vegetable crops group from UC Davis. During the next year, the Department of Nematology  and the Biometrical Laboratory were established. Work also came from UCLA focusing on entomology and plant pathology on ornamentals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just after this, the Air Pollution Research Center was established on the UC Riverside campus, and agronomists from Davis were welcomed to join in the research efforts. A Dry Lands Research Institute was added in 1963, and in the year following, the UC Riverside campus added a Department of Agricultural Engineering. The year after this, the Department of Agronomy accepted further work from UCLA on turf grasses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the expansion of research into all of these areas, it became clear that the university did not simply research citrus, and the Citrus Experiment Station was appropriately renamed the Citrus Research Center and Agricultural Experiment Station, CRC-AES, in 1961. A full college devoted to this research effort was added in 1974, establishing the College of Natural and Agricultrual Sciences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, UC Riverside agricultural and natural science researchers pave the way for many of our Nation's important scientific advances. Studies in plant sciences and environmental and natural resources continue to improve the quality of life for our Nation and our planet. As the Citrus Research Center--Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of California, Riverside celebrates its centennial, I applaud the tremendous efforts and advances and look forward to another century of progress.</paragraph>
