  <speaking speaker="300070" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Alan Harre on the occasion of his retirement from the presidency of Valparaiso University in Valparaiso, IN.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have known Alan for many years and have greatly valued his insightful guidance. He is a man of singular character and faith whose leadership has been an important cornerstone for Valparaiso University and the community in which it resides since his arrival there in 1988.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the University's 17th president, Dr. Harre has overseen an exciting two  decades of growth and expansion on campus. With his support a center for the arts was built, as was the Kade-Duesenberg German House and Cultural Center, the Christopher Center for Library and Information Resources, and the Kallay-Christopher Hall. In addition, several renovation and structural expansion projects owe their success to Dr. Harre's commitment and vision toward making  Valparaiso a world-class collegiate environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But perhaps President Harre's most impressive achievements have very little to do with mere brick and mortar building projects. They include a considerable expansion of the university's nationally ranked graduate programs, greater enrollment of minorities and international students, the establishment of 11 endowed chairs and professorships to attract and retain high caliber instructors, and technological upgrades that offer students 21st century tools and skill-sets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While President Harre will be dearly missed back in Valparaiso, I am confident that the legacy he leaves behind will continue to be a great boon for this lauded institution of learning. I wish Alan every success as he pursues new challenges and adventures.</paragraph>
