  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this has been a joyous new year for the people of Bulgaria. On January 1, Bulgaria and Romania were admitted into the European Union. In less than 16 years Bulgaria has successfully transitioned from a Communist totalitarian regime into a free market democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Three years ago, I was honored to be at the White House with former Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg Gotha as  Bulgaria was admitted into NATO. Bulgaria has proven to be a true ally in the global war on terrorism and there are currently plans for three U.S. bases to be located within Bulgaria. Bulgaria has one of the fastest-growing European economies, and membership in the EU will accelerate its pace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations to President Georgi Parvanov, Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev, Ambassador to Washington Elena Poptodorova, and my longtime friend and former ambassador to Athens, Stefan Stoyanov. I am grateful to serve with Congresswoman ELLEN TAUSCHER as co-chair of the Bulgaria Caucus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
