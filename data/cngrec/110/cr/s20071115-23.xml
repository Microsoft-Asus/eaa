  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="SPECIALIST ADRIAN HIKE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have the responsibility to pay tribute to a soldier from my home State of Iowa who has fallen in the line of duty. SPC Adrian Hike was killed while serving his country in Afghanistan. He was assigned to A Troop, 1st Squadron, 91st Cavalry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My prayers go out to his mother and father in Iowa and all his family and friends. I understand that his loss has come as a shock to those living in and around Sac City where Adrian attended high school. I know that many Iowans will be saddened to learn of his fate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, we can be very proud to call him a fellow Iowan. Specialist Hike was wounded in Iraq, receiving the Purple Heart. After several surgeries, he returned to duty and was even talking about reenlisting. This kind of selfless dedication to our Armed Forces and our country is what has kept us free since the founding of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adrian Hike's honorable service and tremendous sacrifice on behalf of the United States of America should never be forgotten. His was a true patriot and deserves to be remembered as such.</paragraph>
