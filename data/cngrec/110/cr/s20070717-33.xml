  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 4, 2007, in Pearland, TX, Terry Mark Mangum brutally murdered Kenneth Cummings, Jr., for being gay. Mangum says the two had drinks at a Montrose-area club before returning to Cummings' home in Pearland. Mangum confessed to having stabbed Cummings to death with a six-inch knife at Cummings' residence that night. He then burned the body and buried it at a 50-acre ranch owned by his grandfather. Mangum says he believed that Cummings was gay and allegedly had planned the killing for 6 months  prior to the murder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew Shepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
