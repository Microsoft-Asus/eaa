    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, one of President Bush's most used justification for the war in Iraq has been that it is central to winning the war on terror, but the National Intelligence Estimate tells a completely different story.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al Qaeda has only gained strength since the United States invasion of Iraq in March of 2003, and al Qaeda has regenerated in Pakistan along its border with Afghanistan, a reality that may have something to do with the fact that the great majority of our troops and resources are fighting an ill-conceived war in Iraq instead of finishing the job we started in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sad truth is that when our Nation undertook Operation Enduring Freedom after the horrific attacks of &#xD0;9/11, we had al Qaeda on the run. We had them on the verge of being dismantled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush decided to alter our mission at a critical time and send our brave men and women to Iraq that had nothing to do with 9/11, to fight a war that has been a detriment to the war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush had al Qaeda on the ropes. He threw them a life preserver. They were weak, and today they're stronger, according to the report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So to President Bush, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who want to stay the course, I simply ask why? Why would we want to continue a war that the American people want to end?</paragraph>
