    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring about next week's schedule, and I yield to my good friend, the gentleman from Maryland, the majority leader, Mr. Hoyer.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the Republican whip for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday the House will meet at 12:30 for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. There will be no votes before 6:30 p.m. as is our practice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Tuesday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning hour, and at 10 a.m. for legislative business. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m., and on Friday the House will meet at 9 a.m.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to further suspension bills, a complete list of those bills for the week will be announced later this week, we will consider a small business tax relief bill, and a resolution regarding the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because we intend to make sure that every Member who wishes to speak to that matter will have the opportunity to do so, Members should be advised that we will have long days next week, meaning perhaps as late as midnight, and Friday could be a full day in order to complete our work for the week.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for that information. I would like to yield again to him to ask when on our side we might be able to see the resolution in its completed form, or in any form for that matter.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have told our Members that by Monday morning at 10 a.m. we ought to have that resolution available.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would also ask, will we see that resolution go through the Armed Services Committee and be marked up there? Or what will be the process for the resolution? I yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. There have been, I would tell the gentleman, some 22 hearings on Iraq by the Government Reform Committee, by the Armed Services Committee, by the International Relations Committee, by the Appropriations subcommittee and by the Committee on Intelligence. There have been extensive hearings on this bill. This is a resolution. It is being done in conjunction with the Armed Service Committee and the International Relations Committee. I do  not anticipate that there will be a markup of the resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the information. This resolution I guess we have never had a hearing on. But the resolution is going to be put before the body by the leaders. Is that what you anticipate happening, Mr. Leader?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is what I anticipate, the leaders being Mr. Skelton, Mr. Lantos, and others. We expect there to be Members on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, another question: What about the Republican leaders and Members? Will we have a chance to have amendments to this bill? Will we get a chance to have a substitute? Will there be more than one substitute? What kinds of things are you thinking about in terms of the structure of the debate?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we believe that the issue of the President's policy, which was announced some weeks ago, is an extraordinarily serious question confronting the country and the Congress. We expect the resolution to be very straightforward and very simple.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We expect the resolution to deal only with the proposal the President has made for escalation. We believe we should present that to the House of Representatives as an issue on which they can make their advice to the President of the United States and to the Executive Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the answer to the gentleman's question is that we do not believe, as you have not in the past on similar resolutions, I remember your so-called Murtha resolution, we believe that there will be a direct question propounded to the House which every Member can speak to for 3 to 4 days, and then give their advice on.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, would we have at least the opportunity for a recommittal with instructions? At one time I thought you had announced the likelihood that we would have a substitute on Tuesday of this week or sometime earlier this week. Am I hearing now you do not any longer believe we will have that, and will we at least have the recommittal opportunity?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>We are grappling with this, I will tell my friend. We believe the American public, the American people, have the right to know where their representatives stand on the central and sole issue that the resolution will raise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There may be other issues that you might want to raise at some point in time. And there are going to be at least three pieces of legislation, as you know, that will be coming down the pike on this issue: the supplemental, the authorization bill, and the appropriation bill for 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We expect all of those bills to be relatively broad in their treatment of various different aspects. But I will tell the gentleman, frankly, because we feel this is such a critically important question and that the clarity of the question and the clarity of the response is so important that we are trying to carefully consider how we can assure that there is no confusion as to the answer that this House gives.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Of course, I hope that as you grapple with this, you will grapple toward the determination of input into this important debate. I believe, as you do, it is a critically important debate. This is an important issue. You and I have been together to Iraq twice. We both have taken this issue very seriously. We watched and the American people have watched the debate on the other side of this building this week, where the whole process has come to a halt because of the unwillingness of that  body to move forward without having options on the table; and even in that debate, the majority offered at least one alternative opportunity to the minority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that was not acceptable to that minority on that side of the building. I would hope on this side of the building that at least we would get the offer that if you are working on the other side of the building, you walked away from, which would be one opportunity to express another view.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to have 3 full days of debate. The gentleman said some of them could very well last as long as midnight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>That is enough time to consider more than one point of view and have at least two points of view heard. And I heard the gentleman early in the week; I heard him say today, you are still grappling with that. And I would just encourage you to do your best to try to create the opportunity for this issue to be debated in the fullest possible way at this moment and move on with that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to ask, with February 15 being the last day for the current continuing resolution to be in effect, it seems to me possible at least that the Senate is not going to deal  with the bill by the end of the week. Do we have any plans as to how to deal with that issue? Or do you have any information that I don't have that would suggest that it is likely that the Senate will have agreed to a bill that we can agree to?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One option, obviously, would be agree to the bill that the House sent over. But I am interested in what happens on Friday, and between now and Friday that might settle that also, that important issue as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman is correct. On February 15, of course, the existing CR expires in terms of authorization for the funding of the departments that were unfunded in the budget cycle, in the appropriation cycle, so that we need to take action to keep the government operating for all agencies other than Homeland Security and the Defense Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are trying to plan on the contingencies. Obviously, one of the alternatives you mentioned is one that we would hope might be followed, and that is the adoption of the House-passed CR, which we think is one that obviously a broad number of this House supported in a bipartisan fashion. We would hope that the other body would.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if they do not move ahead, we are discussing the possibility of some short-term CR. But those discussions have not moved beyond the contemplation that they may be necessary. They have not come to any decision as to how long it would be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, one of the problems, as the gentleman knows, is we are leaving for a week for the Presidents' Day District Work Period, so that we would not be here at least for the following week. One of the reasons obviously Friday may be a very long day will be because the CR will have expired if we don't pass something, and we may have to deal with it that day, as well as ending the debate that we referred to previously.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for that information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would assume that fairly early in the week, it is likely, it is possible, at least, that having to deal with that CR question will appear to be likely rather than not. I will be glad to join with you in watching that closely early in the week. We look forward to the debate.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will my friend yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I don't want to get into a long debate, but I do want to make an observation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Dreier was critical that we put today's bill on the floor, and he indicated he thought it would take just a few minutes to pass and that everybody would be for it. The Members were hoping that would be the case. But you never can tell.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate those comments. And, of course, after the 6 weeks that we have had of no opportunity to express our views, we were eager to express those, and we were grateful for the open rule. And, frankly, we were able to, I think, bring some good debate to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The re-voting issue surprised me because when we re-voted those amendments that had been passed in the House, on one amendment, 57 people changed their mind between the vote and the re-vote. And on another one, 25 people changed their mind. I had always assumed there was more consistency in the voting than that, but I guess 30 minutes can make a big difference in how that goes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman will yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I think the expression you saw was not on the merits of the amendments.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>That very well could be. I am sure that those Members will be able to explain that fully in that way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for the information.</paragraph>
