  <speaking speaker="412243" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me today in honoring Rev. Dr. Wallace S. Hartsfield, a much-loved member of the Kansas City community. Reverend Hartsfield will soon retire after 40 years as the senior pastor of Metropolitan Missionary Baptist Church. He has served as Metropolitan's pastor since 1972 with the support of his wife Matilda and their four children. Prior to that, he held pastoral positions in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Kansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Hartsfield's distinguished career in the ministry has touched thousands in Missouri. As the ambassador for his church, he has graced pulpits across the country bringing words of hope to the masses. He is a respected servant-leader of many organizations including the National Baptist Convention of America, Inc.; National Baptist Convention, USA; Congress of National Black Churches and the General Baptist State Convention of Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has expanded his ministry as a community advocate. Reverend Hartsfield has spent much of his life speaking up for those whose voices are ignored on the subjects of civil rights, health care, education, crime and safety, and economic development. One of his bravest acts occurred in 1964 when five department stores in downtown Kansas City refused to allow African Americans to try on clothes, use the restrooms, drink at the water fountains, or eat at the lunch counters. Reverend Hartsfield organized  a boycott and marched on the stores. Eventually African Americans were allowed to patronize these stores but it was not without the personal intervention of this inspirational leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His service has afforded him a seat at many tables where he has proven to be a skillful diplomat and a cunning negotiator. Reverend Hartsfield has worked on countless boards including those of the Jazz District Redevelopment Corporation, Greater Kansas City Community Foundation, Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission, and Kansas City Interfaith Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Hartsfield has a bachelor's degree in elementary education and minor degrees in religion and psychology from Clark College in Atlanta, GA. He also holds a bachelor and master of divinity from Gammon Theological Seminary in Atlanta. Dr. Hartsfield has served as an adjunct professor and guest lecturer at numerous colleges and universities across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Hartsfield has been a mentor to many, from pastors to politicians. He continues to provide wise counsel to those who want to make a difference in the world. He also has the ability to identify hidden treasures in those who have not been afforded an opportunity to thrive. This precious gift has been the catalyst for many to realize their dreams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 40 years, the members of Metropolitan have been blessed to have this powerful leader at the helm. Reverend Hartsfield has worked hard and he has earned the opportunity to step back. However, we know his work is not yet done. He will continue shaping lives, communities and destinies for years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During one of the many times he was honored for his good works it was said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wallace Hartsfield does battle with all the dark forces that would keep us from knowing and loving one another. With his Bible and his passion for justice and his rock-ribbed integrity, Reverend Wallace Hartsfield leads us to the high moral ground where all God's children sit down together as family at the table of peace and delight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No truer words could be spoken.</paragraph>
