  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>The failure of Congress to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act amounts to a breach of faith to more than 600 forested counties and 4,400 school districts across our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For Union County, Oregon, this means a third of the road department employees no longer will have a job, other county services will be cut, and another rural school district is left behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night, County Commissioner Colleen MacLeod was making the 8-hour, 616-mile round trip from her home in Union County to the State capital in Salem, where she and other commissioners around Oregon were meeting to discuss how a county declares bankruptcy. Commissioner MacLeod says, "County governments, all they want is to be able to work for themselves, and the Federal Government needs to let us. We just want to be able to work in the woods."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Traveling with the commissioner was the Union County Chamber of Commerce Executive Director, Judy Loudermilk, who says, "What affects one area in a rural community affects us all. Loss of these funds is devastating."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues, Congress must keep the Federal Government's promise to timbered communities. Pass <bill type="h" number="17">H.R. 17</bill> and do it now.</paragraph>
