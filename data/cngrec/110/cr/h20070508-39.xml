  <speaking speaker="400339" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for the last 4 months, we have taken control of the House, and we have headed in the right direction, bringing back necessary oversight of this administration and producing positive results for the American people, especially as it dealt with the special interest groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We got off on a quick start, passing six bills during our first 100 hours that will make college and prescription drugs more affordable and will expand economic opportunities for millions of Americans who have not received a pay raise in the last 9 years. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to indicate to you that we will continue to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also passed the budget for 2007 that should have been done last year, striking out all earmarks and adding additional money for our veterans, $3.6 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to also announce that we passed a supplemental that added additional money for our veterans, an additional $1.8 billion for our war veterans. Unfortunately, the President has vetoed this piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to continue to push forward in making sure that we have oversight over these committees.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
