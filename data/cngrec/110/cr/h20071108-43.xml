  <narrative>APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON <bill type="h" number="3093">H.R. 3093</bill>, COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13387]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400281" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1 of rule XXII and by direction of the Committee on Appropriations, I move to take from the Speaker's table the bill (<bill type="h" number="3093">H.R. 3093</bill>) making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes, with a Senate amendment thereto, disagree to the Senate amendment, and agree to the conference asked by the Senate.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion.</chair>
  <chair>The motion was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Frelinghuysen moves that the managers on the part of the House at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the bill, <bill type="h" number="3093">H.R. 3093</bill>, be instructed to recede to section 527 of the Senate amendment.</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to clause 7 of rule XXII, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen) and the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mollohan) each will control 30 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400142" topic="MOTION TO INSTRUCT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this motion to instruct is straightforward. It instructs the House conferees to recede to the Senate on a provision in the Senate-passed bill that would prevent the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from using funds to initiate civil action against an organization which requires its employees to speak English at work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision was motivated by a lawsuit filed earlier this year against the Salvation Army. In that particular case, the EEOC sued the Salvation Army over its policy that its employees speak English. The lawsuit sought hundreds of thousands of dollars in monetary and punitive damages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is more troubling is that when you look at the history of this issue, you will find a Federal court ruling almost 4 years ago that upheld the Salvation Army's policy that employees speak English at work. You will also find that the Salvation Army gave the two employees a year to learn English before it took action to terminate them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The EEOC has an important mission, one which we all support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The EEOC currently has a tremendous backlog of pending cases, approximately 46,000, a number that the Commission estimates will grow. At a time when the EEOC is struggling to fulfill its mission, cases like this lead one to questions about the Commission's ability to set priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By insisting on the Senate amendment, we are sending an important message to the EEOC that we expect them to prioritize their actions and work diligently to address the major discrimination issues facing the American workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the motion and reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400281" topic="MOTION TO INSTRUCT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman that this amendment would send an important message to the EEOC, but I agree it's important for a different reason. I think it's important because I think it would be a perverse message.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States Congress has, in previous years, passed legislation specifically granting to the EEOC authorization and responsibility to work on behalf of employees where they face discrimination in the workplace. That legislation anticipated an opening of a remedy for employees. This amendment would close a remedy for employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These cases should be decided on their facts. If we were to adopt this motion and the conference were to include the amendment in its agreement, then the EEOC would not have an opportunity to look at the facts and represent employees pursuant thereto. Therefore, we do oppose the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to point out that the court in this case upheld the decision and upheld the position of the employer in this case. That's well and good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What's important in that is that the court, through due process, decided the matter. That's the way the EEOC ought to operate, not through Congress in a motion to instruct conferees and in an appropriation conference, taking away what the Congress has already given jurisdiction in these cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
