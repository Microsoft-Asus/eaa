    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to tell the story of Jonell Stinnett from my district in Fairdale, Kentucky. Here are her words:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"My story is about my brother and his wife who died last September. Carol, my sister-in-law, had colon cancer for over 7 years. She took chemo for the last 5 years of her life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"My brother had a heart attack 2 years after she was diagnosed. A week after his heart surgery, he had a massive stroke which paralyzed his right side, and then he got a diabetic ulcer on his foot and finally had to have his leg amputated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Needless to say, their medical bills were massive. They lost everything they had worked for their whole life. I take care of him now, and he needed to file bankruptcy. He needs a ramp to get out his front door, a safe way to take a shower, but there is no help anywhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I believe as an American citizen who has worked, paid taxes, and served his country in the Armed Forces, there should be some sort of help. I don't know what, but with all the intelligent people in Washington, it seems they could come up with some kind of plan for people like these so they don't lose all they have made."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was Jonell Stinnett, one voice from Kentucky's Third District.</paragraph>
