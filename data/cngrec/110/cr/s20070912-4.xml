  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, fortunately, this morning, we are going to conclude action on this Transportation appropriations bill, which is so vitally important to this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the hard work last night of the managers, Senators Murray and Bond, the last remaining amendments will be disposed of this morning. Those are an amendment by Senator DeMint, amendments by Senator Coburn, and then final passage. There is a period of 20 minutes of debate with respect to the DeMint amendment and then a rollcall vote following the DeMint amendment, if the participants so desire, and then there will be 2 minutes of debate on the Coburn amendments.  So Members should be prepared to vote around 9:25. There will be three rollcall votes--DeMint, Coburn, and then final passage. They will be the only votes today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Members return next week, there will be no rollcall votes on Monday, September 17, as I had previously announced a long time ago. But on Tuesday, we may have votes in the morning. I haven't worked that out yet with the distinguished Republican leader. We do have some things we have to try to dispose of prior to moving to the Defense authorization bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maybe today, if not on Monday next, we will have a consent agreement regarding how we are going to move forward on the Iraq amendments and the Defense authorization bill. So next week will be an action-packed week. We have the Jewish holiday--we have Yom Kippur--which will begin next Friday, 9 days from now, at sundown. That being the case, we will have no votes after 1 o'clock on Friday next.</paragraph>
