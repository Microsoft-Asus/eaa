  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, what we are asking with the amendment I have tried to put forward but which was ruled out of order is to simply restore the $3.1 billion that was cut from the Base Closing Commission military construction. We cut--not we, but the bill that is on the floor that we are not able to amend--$3.1 billion out of the Base Closing Commission military construction funding. Our amendment, the Hutchison-Inhofe amendment, has 27 cosponsors. That is almost one-third of the Senate,  and there are many who said they would like to sponsor the amendment but in deference to their leadership did not feel they could, because so many States have major projects in this BRAC military construction funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are not projects that any Member of Congress put in this bill or in the bill that passed the House and Senate. These are the Department of Defense projects, for them to be able to meet the congressionally mandated deadline of 2011 for finishing the BRAC process. So they are projects that were selected in order of priority by the Department of Defense. There is not one earmark, not one congressional add in the military construction budget that we are trying to restore. We are trying to restore  the budget we have already passed so the Department of Defense can meet the deadline we have set.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this amendment should be in order. It is my great hope that the distinguished leader and the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee will allow it to go forward with no further delay, because there is going to be a delay if we wait until the supplemental. Not only will the $3 billion be outside of the scope of the budget and add $3 billion more to the deficit, but it will, in fact, delay the building projects for yet another 2 months, which will be a whole half year that  the Department of Defense will be strapped for the funds to do what it needs to do to have its synchronized movement of troops be able to accomplish what they are trying to accomplish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we will have a reconsideration. I hope the House will work with us. We have a whole week to do it. We have done things in 24 hours that were harder than this, and I believe that delaying the return of 12,000 troops to facilities they deserve to have is not a good bargain. So I am very hopeful we will eventually have true bipartisanship in the Senate, true bipartisanship in the Appropriations Committee, which has been the tradition in the Senate for all these years. I ask that the majority  in leadership help work with us to accommodate the needs of the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me inquire as to how much time is left open from the 10 minutes of the Senator of Texas?</paragraph>

  <chair> There is 5 minutes 40 seconds.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that those 5 minutes be divided between myself and Senator Chambliss.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have been watching this debate as it has taken place. I am disappointed that procedurally we dropped the ball. We were hoping to be able to speak all afternoon on probably the most immediate crisis we are facing in terms of the budget; that is, the BRAC process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me share a couple of ideas as to what this is all about. A lot of people are not all that familiar with the process we are talking about. The BRAC process is the Base Closure Realignment Commission. It was brought to our attention and first voted on by a Congressman from Texas, Dick Armey. Prior to that time, it appeared that all of our military establishments that were in the United States had been looked at as economic bases. Consequently, it is very difficult to close down some that are  either not efficient or not needed for defending the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was the idea of Congressman Armey to put together a system to take politics out of the base-closure system and to allow some criteria to be put forth and have a base-closure commission make recommendations and then take those recommendations and put them into effect. The bottom line would be they may find, in my State of Oklahoma, that one of our installations should be closed or should be realigned and part of it moved somewhere else. If that is the case, we would have to vote on the overall  picture. You could not pick or choose. That way, as nearly as you can take politics out of a procedure on this Senate floor, I believe they successfully did that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had the first BRAC round back in 1988. We have had four since then. The last one is the one we are talking about now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to say that when we came to this fifth BRAC closure vote as to whether we are going to allow the Commission to reconvene and make determinations as to priorities, I voted against it. I led the opposition. In fact, we only lost it by two votes. We have had a BRAC round, after all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I made a statement from this Senate floor, from this podium, that whatever recommendations they came up with on this independent, nonpartisan BRAC Commission, I would not object to, and that is exactly what has happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem we are facing--and I can remember so well saying in the Senate before this last round was decided upon, I said it may be that we will save $20 billion over a period of time with another BRAC round. We don't know that for sure, but there is one thing we do know; that is, it is going to cost us a lot of money in the next 3 or 4 years, right when we are going to need the funding for our military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We went through the 1990s downgrading and downsizing the military. I remember this euphoric attitude that many people had--the Cold War is over, and we no longer need a military. Consequently, the attention was not given to the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a chart I have not used for quite a while. This is during the Clinton administration, from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 2001. If we take the black line, that shows that if we merely kept the budget we had for the military from fiscal year 1993 and added nothing but inflation, the black line would represent the amount of the budget and what it would have been at the end of that period of time. The red line represents what the President's budget--it was President Clinton at that  time and what he was requesting. You can see the huge difference in there, about a $412 billion difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress, in its wisdom, increased the President's budget insofar as military spending is concerned to this line right here. Nonetheless, over that period of time, while we did bring it up a little bit, it still was $313 billion below what a static budget would have been from that year, in bringing that year forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the problem we are facing in the 1990s, the late 1990s. I remember so many times coming to the Senate and saying that we will rue the day we downgraded the military. And we did. We went down to about 60 percent of the force strength, did away with and slowed down a lot of our military modernization programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember watching other countries producing better equipment, so when we send our young people out to do battle, they don't have the kind of equipment someone else might have. A good example would be our non-line-of-sight cannon, artillery piece. The best piece we have today is the Paladin. That is World War II technology where you have to swab the breach after every shot--something that is totally unacceptable. There are five countries, including South Africa, that make a better cannon than  we have. We are going to remedy that now, and we have future combat systems where we will start modernizing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also slipped behind in the Air Force. I remember when General Jumper at that time came to the Senate, in 1998, and he said that now the Russians are making the Su series, and he referred to the Su-35 and he said it was better than any strike vehicle we have, our F-15s and F-16s. Now we have an F-22 that will do a better job. This is what happened to us in the 1990s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we come to the BRAC process. We had an opportunity to save $20 billion. But to do that, we have to build installations in different areas, divest ourselves of other installations. That is where we are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As has been said by several speakers in the Senate, we are in a position now going into a continuing resolution, that it would tie us to the 2006 budget. If this happens, the BRAC funding that is necessary to implement the changes to accommodate our fighting troops over there, in their rotations coming back home--all of these things that are taking place are things that can't be taking place now because we are $3 billion short.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My next chart shows we are scraping just to fund the BRAC process. The money the military needs to pursue the BRAC round in fiscal year 2007 is $5.6 billion. You can see that on the chart. That is the amount the President requested. That is also the amount in our authorization bill, the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act. Those on the Senate Committee on Armed Services authorized this $5.6 billion. The Senate appropriators thought they could shave a little bit off, so they cut from  that $.4 billion. That brings it down to $5.2 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because there is no appropriated amount, the BRAC was funded at the fiscal year 2006 level, which is $1.6 billion--far lower than what is required to even start the process of this latest BRAC round. Under the continuing resolution now being considered, the funding was increased by $1 billion, which puts us at a total of $2.5 billion less what the military is  going to have to have. That means it is a $3.1 billion shortfall. I know it is confusing, so we put it on a chart so we can clearly understand it. That is what is necessary to carry out those requirements we had in the BRAC round.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We did get $1 billion. Let me tell Members where that came from. The Democrats scraped and squeezed all the unfunded amounts that were needed to be funded by the CR. They were able to get an extra $13 billion to fund their own priorities. We talked about those priorities, many of them social programs, many of them programs I would support, some programs I would oppose. To me, they were not in the league of necessity that we have in our military construction in carrying out and implementing BRAC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chart shows the amount of money, the $13 billion, and where this money went. If you go around the chart, you see Veterans' Administration, $4.5 billion--we supported that; defense health, $1.4 billion; State and Foreign Ops--this is HIV/AIDS, which has been talked about in the Senate--that is $1.25 billion; law enforcement, $1.35 billion--quite frankly, I am not sure what that is referring to; pay raise for Federal workers, $1 billion; Labor-HHS, Head Start, AIDS, Social Security, and so  forth, Pell grants, that is $2.3 billion; Interior Department, $200 million. Finally, after everyone else is taken care of, everyone else has been funded, there is $1 billion left over to put toward BRAC. The need was $4.1 billion. It brings it down to the $3.1 billion. So the need is still there. That is how we got where we are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this Senate needs to do is to evaluate and establish priorities as to  what is really significant. What do we need to add? We are at war. It is inconceivable to me, when we come along with a BRAC process that applies housing and other needs for our troops who are rotating back and forth, that we are not able to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the concerns I have that I have not talked about in the Senate is the problems we have in the communities. One of the reasons my State of Oklahoma has always, throughout all BRAC processes, all five of them, benefited--and I am bragging a little bit here, and I know other States do a good job--Oklahoma has always done an excellent job on community support. In our five major military installations, we have the communities building hospitals, doing child health care, helping with roads,  donating land. For that reason, we have always done a very good job of that in my State. A lot of people were concerned when the BRAC processes took place; that is something which has actually been a benefit to my State. However, in this case, there isn't a State that isn't involved either in pluses or minuses, but overall it is a way to take care of those kids when they come back, when they rotate through.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have two things that are happening right now. We are trying to rotate our troops who were in battle, and the second thing is, we are trying to establish a program where, instead of sending some of our people overseas for 3 and 4 years with their families, to bring them back and let them rotate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I am going to yield the floor. It is my intention to come back. I have quite a few more things to talk about.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Under the previous order, the Senator from Georgia is recognized for 12 1/2  minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say to my friend from Oklahoma, as well as to my colleague from Texas, we appreciate their leadership on this issue, restoring this funding for the transition as required under BRAC. The Senator from Oklahoma and I both went through some very difficult times under BRAC. Now, to not be able to carry out the direction of the Commissioners with the difficult decisions that were made is simply not right. Without his leadership, we would not be where we are today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the Senator yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>The point I was trying to make in terms of community support, many communities in Georgia and Oklahoma have made commitments predicated on this next BRAC round coming forward. I ask the question, Aren't you a little concerned how to face the communities if we renege on what the Government's portion is?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="">
    <paragraph>The Senator is exactly right. I will address that in my comments in a few minutes. It is not fair to the taxpayers in general but specifically those communities that are affected, as communities in Oklahoma and Georgia are, that we now come back and say: I know you have made these plans and you were preparing to receive additional infrastructure, but now it will not happen because the folks in the Senate have decided they want to spend that money on social programs as opposed to  spending it on our military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do rise today to support my colleagues in restoring funds for the Department of Defense fiscal year 2007 BRAC requirements in the continuing resolution. The fiscal year 2007 President's budget requested $16.7 billion for MILCON, which included $5.7 for fiscal year 2005 base realignment and closure actions required to meet a statutory deadline of September 15, 2011, to complete all realignments and closures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fiscal year 2007 Defense authorization bill authorized MILCON appropriations of $17.4 billion after accounting for $278 million in prior year rescissions proposed by appropriators in both Chambers. The final authorized amount was $17.1 billion--$400 million above the President's budget for fiscal year 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate passed a fiscal year 2007 MILCON appropriations bill at $434 million below the fiscal year 2007 President's budget by cutting the BRAC request and accounting for additional rescissions. The House version of the fiscal year 2007 MILCON appropriations bill is $803 million below the President's budget, and it cut BRAC and $500 million in projects requested in the President's budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No conference allocation was provided and a conference agreement was never reached.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A continuing resolution was enacted through February 15, 2007, at levels equaling the fiscal year 2006 appropriations, but currently does not allow for military construction new starts in fiscal year 2007. In addition, the fiscal year 2006 BRAC appropriation is $4 billion below the request for fiscal year 2007. Therefore, over 90 percent of the authorized fiscal year 2007 MILCON projects will not be able to be constructed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new CR language proposed by House and Senate appropriators on January 30 would provide fiscal year 2007 MILCON funds at levels requested in the fiscal year 2007 President's budget, but would underfund BRAC in fiscal year 2007 by $3 billion, seriously jeopardizing the ability of the Department of Defense to carry out all BRAC actions by 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Inhofe offered a bill in early January that I cosponsored along with several other Members of the Senate that would appropriate funds for all MILCON projects authorized in the fiscal year 2007 Defense authorization bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy on January 30, strongly opposing the reductions that are in the continuing resolution we are considering. The Secretary of Defense and the service chiefs and Secretaries have met with many of us to provide an assessment of the impact on military programs as well as military readiness. By cutting $3.1 billion in the fiscal year 2007 BRAC request, the proposed continuing resolution does not allow the Department to carry out the investments  and the timing required to complete all BRAC initiatives by 2011. That is a statutory requirement established to assist communities affected by BRAC by mandating an accelerated transition to aid in economic recovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deferring funds will result in higher contract costs as construction will be delayed and ultimately compressed in a tighter execution timeframe, forcing a greater demand for limited resources. Resolving this issue has the support of key members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, as well as many military and local community advocacy groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee intends to attempt to restore BRAC funding in the supplemental appropriations bill. But what kind of solution is this? Supplemental funds have been requested by the President for military operations in Iraq as well as Afghanistan. The funds requested in the supplemental are critically needed to purchase equipment for force protection and IED defeat initiatives. These funds would be used to train and equip Iraqi security forces.  The funds will be used for military intelligence, coalition support, and other regional operations in the global war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since when do base realignments and closures qualify as an emergency directly supporting the global war on terror? How do we explain to the American taxpayer that BRAC should be considered along with body armor, additional military end strength, and vehicles being used in Iraq and Afghanistan?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, we are having this discussion because my colleagues who developed the resolution share with all of us the common goal to reduce overall Government expenditures. In that spirit, what critical warfighting requirement do we cut in the supplemental to pay for the BRAC increase that is proposed? What do we deny to our frontline fighting troops? While I heard the idea of funding BRAC in the supplemental, I have not heard one idea on how we pay for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do they instead advocate for an increase in the supplemental? Why not just add funds to the resolution we have in front of us, as this is proper? Could it be they want to hide the additional funds they have inserted for domestic programs by pushing BRAC to an inappropriate method of funding? Is this how we propose to manage military appropriations for the future? By using budget gimmicks and shell games which will have devastating results for the military and for local communities? We must address  full fiscal year 2007 funding for BRAC in this continuing resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Including funds for BRAC in the CR is critical to modernizing and increasing the readiness of our Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current CR provides $2.7 billion for Base Realignment and Closure programs, which is $3.1 billion below the President's request, as I previously stated. These reductions are inconsistent with congressional emphasis on force and readiness. Such a severe reduction to BRAC funding will force the Department to rephase BRAC implementation plans. This will have a negative ripple effect on the movement of troops and missions throughout our global defense posture restructuring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This planned approach could delay force rotations to Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the Army's overall readiness posture, which relies on completing the Modular Force conversions on time. This move will impact readiness. And soldiers at Fort Campbell, Fort Drum, and Fort Stewart will not have adequate places to train, work, or sleep.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This move will devastate the Department's ability to complete BRAC actions within statutory deadlines. It will stymie efforts to construct facilities and move equipment and people to receiver locations, thereby impeding our ability to realize savings and organizational efficiencies. Over 82 percent of the fiscal year 2007 BRAC request is for construction that is required before these moves can occur. The current continuing resolution cuts funding for family housing by $300 million below the President's  request. This will directly and adversely affect the quality of life of our servicemembers by perpetuating the continued use of inadequate facilities where they work, train, and live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regarding my home State of Georgia, the following projects will be in jeopardy--and these are going  to have very serious consequences to the ability to train and give quality of life to the soldiers, which they deserve--a child development center at Fort Benning; two trainee barracks complexes at Fort Benning; training brigade complex at Fort Benning; fire and movement range at Fort Benning; modified record fire range at Fort Benning; brigade headquarters building at Fort Benning; stationary gunnery range at Fort Benning; Marine Corps Reserve center at Robins Air Force base; Marine Corps Reserve  center in Rome, GA; three facilities to prepare Moody Air Force Base to receive A-10 aircraft; and relocation of a vehicle maintenance complex at Robins Air Force Base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>None of these improvements can be made for our fighting men and women without this funding. It is imperative we do so in this CR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I inquire as to how much time I have remaining?</paragraph>
