  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress, good news. Last Wednesday, after 10 or 12 years of having the opportunity to play the Georgetown law faculty to raise money for the homeless, the congressional basketball team helped Georgetown raise $334,000 for the homeless. We are very pleased about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But more importantly, after two overtimes and sudden death, the House of Representatives won the game. We are very pleased that we have such star players. With just 2.8 seconds left in regular time, our Member, Tim Ryan, got fouled on a three-pointer. The game was 39-36, he made all three shots, and we went into overtime. We went into another overtime; and finally the referee said, you are now going into sudden death. I am pleased to report that my son, Mervyn Jones, made the last shot  in sudden death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, the Hill's Angels beat the Georgetown Hoyas. And 40 members of the page crew came along to cheer for us.</paragraph>
