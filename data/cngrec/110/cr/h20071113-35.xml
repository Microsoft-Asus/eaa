  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="808">H. Res. 808</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments is an independent, nonprofit organization, founded in 1957, and comprised of elected officials from 21 local governments of the District of Columbia, suburban Maryland, and Northern Virginia, plus area members of the Maryland and Virginia legislatures, the U.S. Senate, and the U.S. House of Representatives;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in April 1957 forty officials from Washington area jurisdictions voluntarily  gathered to establish an organization where they could exchange ideas and work together on regional issues such as transportation, the environment, and public safety; this organization became the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas during the past half century COG's activities have touched every aspect of the life of the citizens of the National Capital Region and have improved the quality of life for all residents;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas COG has facilitated the development of effective responses to such issues as the environment, affordable housing, economic development, human services, land use development, public safety and emergency response, and transportation that have had a profound and positive impact on the National Capital Region;</narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas these responses include galvanizing the region's response to the September 11th attacks and the ongoing emergency preparedness programs, cleaning up of the Potomac River, spearheading a number of regional health programs including one of the nation's first regional conferences on AIDS, creating the region's express bus lane system, reducing air pollution through a model law and establishing the region's daily air quality index, and founding the Foster and Adoptive Families program for  vulnerable children and teenagers;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas COG has served as the Metropolitan Planning Organization guiding the region's transportation planning in partnership with the state and local departments of transportation since the 1960s and has served as key advocate for increased funding for the region's transportation needs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas COG's air quality committee created by the State of Maryland, the Commonwealth of Virginia and the District of Columbia, has worked successfully to reduce pollutants in the region's air;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas COG has worked with area governments and law enforcement and emergency response officials to improve public safety response and coordination for over four decades, starting with the "mutual aid agreements" that began with the opening of the Wilson Bridge in 1962 and continuing to the present with homeland security planning and initiatives such as the regional pawnshop database that has helped recover millions of dollars of stolen property; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas COG managed a Federal pilot program to provide treatment and support services to women who abused alcohol and drugs, and currently works with area health officials to improve the region's emergency preparedness by developing a disease and syndromic surveillance system: Now, therefore, be it</narrative>
  <narrative> Resolved, That the United States House of Representatives does hereby offers its sincerest congratulations to the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments in recognition of its 50th Anniversary and its legacy of outstanding service to the governments and citizens of greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan region and expresses its appreciation for a job well done.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.</paragraph>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400283" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my good friend and distinguished colleague from Illinois for yielding me the time. I have the great honor to offer this resolution on behalf of all of my colleagues in the Washington metropolitan area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Council of Governments of the Washington Metropolitan Area began 50 years ago, in 1957. In the ensuing 50 years, it has become the premier group for collaboration on transportation, air and water quality, regional growth, emergency response, and any number of other domestic issues that are important to its individual jurisdictions. We will be honoring the Council of Governments Thursday night in their 50th anniversary gala, and all of our Washington area colleagues, including Ms. Norton,  Congressman Van Hollen, Congressman Hoyer, Congressman Wynn, Congressman Davis and Congressman Wolf, will all participate, as they have been participating since they have been elected to office in the Council of Governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its first meeting during the Eisenhower administration where there were seven charter member governments, it has grown to include 21 local jurisdictions. As it has grown, it has become the place to discuss and address and solve so many of the region's problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the Council of Governments, this is one of the finest regions in the country in which to live. But it wasn't always that way. Fifty years ago, it had half of its current population, it had no Metro system and no interstate highway system. Imagine, just 50 years ago. But the visionary leaders of this area got together, and in working with the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, have made enormous strides in creating a region that is proud to be the capital of the free world,  and those who live here reflect that pride. But it didn't happen by accident. COG has been an essential component of that growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1967, COG was responsible for the D.C. Air Pollution Act. It was a model that was created by the Council of Governments, signed by President Johnson. The fire chiefs of the area got together and put together a mutual aid agreement. That became the model for the 9/11 Commission's recommendation for all metropolitan areas in the country. The response of the Council of Governments on September 11, 2001, in pulling together all of the emergency responders, was tremendous and deserves great credit  as well. The Regional Incident Communication Coordination System is a model in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now those 21 local governments have over 250 members. We have one of the highest quality of life achievements in the country and the Nation's strongest economy. And as we plan for an additional 1.6 million people and 1.2 million more jobs over the next 25 years, COG will continue to address those challenges. When we look forward to the next 50 years, COG predicts that by the year 2057 the average home in metropolitan Washington will cost more than $14 million. That means a lot of pay increases  for all of the Federal workers, I guess including the Members themselves. But we are going to be part of a mega-region stretching from Baltimore to Richmond. The way in which we use energy is going to be a key determinant in terms of the region's prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be enormous changes that take place. But whatever changes take place, we know that the Council of Governments is going to be there as a meeting place, as a forum, as a facilitator, to address all of the challenges that confront us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, after 50 years of tremendous achievement, we do want to recognize this organization, and I very much appreciate the committee giving us the opportunity to do so. I think I have used my time, and I don't think there is much controversy, so I will conclude my remarks at this point.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to join with the gentleman from Virginia, my friend, in enthusiastically supporting this legislation. After 50 years of this kind of a Council of Governments' working, it deserves the recognition it will receive here on the House floor today. I certainly believe that Mr. Moran has done a very, very good job of outlining the 50 years of success, beginning in April of 1957, and I think we should briefly reflect on what 1957 until day was all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a time in which the District of Columbia went through terrible upheaval. Maryland and Virginia had to reinvent themselves. All of this could not have been done without the kind of cooperation that this council produced. I think it is certainly unique to have the District of Columbia and two States, five counties, two cities and dozens of Maryland counties all working together. These jurisdictions are cooperating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that is a legacy that has only half finished its work. I think on a bipartisan basis we all recognize the improvements in the quality of living here, the transportation and infrastructure that makes it possible for us to get to work by road or by rail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, I look forward to this organization continuing for another 50 years serving what is today 1.6 million people, and certainly a growing population, both in and out of the district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I very much urge passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, and I commend Representative Moran for his introduction of <bill type="hr" number="808">H. Res. 808</bill>, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the regional planning that has taken place in the Washington, D.C., area. It has been instrumental in making this, as he indicated, one of the most desirable areas of the country in which to live. I commend them for their effort and salute him for his introduction of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, <bill type="hr" number="808">H. Res. 808</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
