  <speaking speaker="300010" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kansas, who made the point well that we cannot afford to lose in Iraq. I thought my colleagues, and maybe those who may be interested--if anybody is paying attention and watching the floor--may be interested to hear what the intelligence community said in public. It is rare we have public hearings in the Intelligence Committee, but once a year at least we have the worldwide threat hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Thursday, we had that hearing and we spent about 5 1/2  hours. It was very informative and mostly dealt with Iraq. Present were the Director of National Intelligence, Ambassador Negroponte; Director Hayden of the CIA; Director of the DIA General Maples; Mr. Foote from the State Department INR; and FBI Director Robert Mueller. Much of the questioning was about what is going on in Iraq. I think the consensus of the intelligence community was that while things have not gone well, the new commitment  by Prime Minister Maliki and the rest of his Government--not just the Shia Prime Minister but the Kurds and the Sunnis--was to take over and take ownership of ending the insurgency in Iraq. That gave us the best hope of achieving a peaceful solution that would leave</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, one of the real problems we have had has been the reluctance of the Iraqi Government to let us go in and eliminate Shia militia, such as the Moqtada al-Sadr Mahdi army. This has been a serious problem. The American forces have been held back. Now it is our understanding--and the intelligence community believes what they have told the policymakers in the executive branch--that this is now the best chance, because they realize time is running out, that while our commitment was strong to  Iraq, it is not an unending one, infinite.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are going to have to take control if they don't want to see their country descend into chaos. So there was a lot of talk about the pros and cons of the policy the President announced to turn over the responsibility to the Iraqi military, for ending the insurgency in Baghdad, and to send our troops into the Al Anbar province to deal with radical Islamists, such as al-Qaida, who continue to stir up problems and who we believe were responsible for the bombing of the Golden Mosque in Samara,  which escalated the insurgency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I asked another question and the answers, I thought, were very telling. They were not covered in the media. I asked what if we decided now or within 2 or 3 months to withdraw and turn it over to the Iraqi Government, and the consensus was uniform and frightening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Admiral Negroponte said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I think the view pretty much across the community is that a precipitous withdrawal could lead to a collapse of the government of that country, and a collapse of their security forces, because we simply don't think that they are ready to take over, to assume full control of their security responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We think that that is a goal that can be achieved on a gradual basis and on a well-planned basis. But to simply withdraw now, I think, could have catastrophic effects. And I think that's a quite widely held view inside of Iraq itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later, I went back and asked what it would mean in terms of the worldwide terrorist threat of al-Qaida. Director Negroponte responded:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think in terms of al-Qaida's own planning, if you look at the letter that Zawahiri wrote to Zarqawi last year about establishing in Iraq a sort of beachhead for the expansion of al-Qaida's ideology throughout the Islamic world, establishing the caliphate, it would be the very sanctuary for international terrorism that we are seeking to avoid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, the No. 2 man under Osama bin Laden, Zawahiri, wrote to the notorious, infamous butcher Zarqawi, who had beheaded Americans and others on television, to tell him to cool it; we are trying to establish a basis for al-Qaida to operate out of Iraq. This would be, in Zawahiri's and bin Laden's own words, establishing the range of the caliphate. What they mean by that is to establish a Taliban style of government, such as we saw in Afghanistan, on a regionwide and ultimately a global  basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I asked General Maples about the impact of withdrawal, precipitous or immediate, or politically, a timetable withdrawal, determined by what we want in Washington, rather than what is available on the ground. He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>..... I believe that a failure in Iraq would empower the jihadist movement. It would give that base of operations from which the jihadist movement would expand. And it's consistent with the goals of al-Qaida in Iraq to establish that Islamic state, and then to expand it into the caliphate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He went on to say there would be regional impacts and that there would be a tremendous economic impact. He cited hydrocarbons and, obviously, we know Iraq is very rich in oil reserves, and it would make oil reserves available to fund the activities of al-Qaida and the international radical Islamist terrorist movements. He also said it would have an impact on the world market on oil, driving up the power of oil. He concluded by saying it would give Iran the power to expand its evil empire, which  President Ahmadi-Nejad is urgently trying to expand not only in the Middle East but throughout Latin America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think probably the best summary of the intelligence community estimates of the impact of the choices--and we are talking about choices--is there is nothing good in terms of choices. One option has been put forward by President Bush. I happen to believe it is the best available option to support the Iraqis who have committed to end the insurgency, to bring the Sunnis into a government that would share in the oil revenues and take responsibility for ending the insurgency, while our troops go  after the external forces, the terrorists coming in from other countries and joining the al-Qaida movement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I asked General Hayden to give me a concise statement of his view and the view of the intelligence community on the second option, which would be to  withdraw now, or to set a short timetable deadline in 2 or 3 months. I will read what he said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, sir, Senator. When I went before the Iraq Study Group, I prefaced my remarks by saying I think I'll give a rather--I'm going to be giving a rather somber assessment of the situation in Iraq. But before I do that, I said, let me tell you. If we leave under the current circumstances, everything gets worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At that point, I commended him for being a master of understatement. He went on to say:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Three quick areas. More Iraqis die from the disorder inside Iraq. Iraq becomes a safe haven, perhaps more dangerous than the one al-Qaida had in Afghanistan. And finally, the conflict in Iraq bleeds over into the neighborhood and threatens serious regional instability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said, well, what would be the threat to the U.S. homeland? How does that affect us in Washington, in Rhode Island, Missouri, Kansas, New York, Los Angeles, and elsewhere? He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The immediate threat comes from providing al-Qaida that which they are attempting to seek in several locations right now, be it Somalia, the tribal area of Pakistan or Anbar province--a safe haven to rival that which they had in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have my views on this. This is the overwhelming consensus of the intelligence community. There are no great options, but the best option, they believe, is to provide American troops to support what the Government of Iraq has pledged to do, and that is to end the insurgency, to stop the Shia death squads, to cut the Sunnis in on a fair share of the Government, and take responsibility not only for clearing but for controlling the areas in Baghdad that have been the problem. So I think as we talk  about the options available, it is vitally important that we listen to the intelligence community and their best assessments of what happens if we follow the President's plan or if we choose a course of continuing to do what we have been doing, without assisting the Iraqis to take control of their Government, or if we cut and run.</paragraph>
