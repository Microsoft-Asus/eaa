  <speaking speaker="400087" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of awarding Aung San Suu Kyi the Congressional Gold Medal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, since the founding of our country, this Congress has awarded more than 300 people and organizations the Congressional Gold Medal. We have bestowed this honor on those who have performed outstanding deeds and acts of service. Past recipients include the Dalai Lama, for his contributions to peace, nonviolence, human rights and religious understanding; Elie Wiesel, one of the foremost spokesmen of the victims of the Holocaust; the Reverend Francis X. Quinn, pastor of the Church of the  Guardian Angel in New York City, who risked his own life in persuading an armed gunman to surrender to police and free an elderly couple he was holding hostage; Mother Teresa of Calcutta; and Nelson Mandela of South Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Like those who have received this award before, Aung San Suu Kyi embodies the spirit of the Congressional Gold Medal, dedicating her life to the cause of freedom and democracy by fighting to establish peace in her home country of Burma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aung San Suu Kyi was born in Burma in 1945, and 2 years after her birth her father negotiated Burma's independence from the United Kingdom and was then assassinated by his rivals that very same year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like father, like daughter, Ms. Suu Kyi has spent most of her life working to better her native country. Although Burma established democratic rule after becoming an independent republic in 1947, a military coup toppled the government in 1962, and since then the government has been effectively under military control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than 20 years, Ms. Suu Kyi has led the effort to end military rule in her country. In 1988, she helped form the National League for Democracy, also known as the NLD, which advocates nonviolence. She is currently the NLD's general secretary. In 1990, despite being under house arrest, she led her political party to a landslide victory in parliamentary elections, gaining 82 percent of the seats in Parliament. The military junta snubbed the will of the Burmese people by nullifying the results  of the election and, subsequently, ruling with an iron fist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout her political career, Aung San Suu Kyi has been in and out of house arrest, but this has only solidified her determination to secure democracy for the people of Burma. And, when offered the chance to leave the country and live in exile, she said "no," choosing instead to stand with her fellow citizens of Burma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In August, her struggles and the struggles of the Burmese people were thrust onto the international stage when pictures of monks protesting the military junta were shown all over the world. Despite the junta's violent crackdown on dissidents, protesters have remained committed to peaceful protests, inspired by their rightful leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who met with foreign leaders and junta officials from her home to work for a peaceful way forward after the bloody nationwide crackdown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their efforts prompted new calls for democracy within the global community. The United Nations' Secretary was outspoken in calling on the junta to allow for democracy to take place in Burma. And First Lady Laura Bush continues to make public statements in support of the democratic movement in Burma, and we are all grateful to the First Lady's efforts in trying to bring about democratization within Burma; yet, the nation is still under military control and Aung San Suu Kyi's fight for democratic  rule continues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Burma is a nation in the heart of southeast Asia. It is bordered by China, Laos, Thailand, Bangladesh, and India. In a region that is working to establish firm stability, Burma is a cancer whose main exports are illegal drugs, diseases like HIV and AIDS, and refugees pouring into neighboring countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Burma and Southeast Asia deserve to live in a stable and thriving region. That is why the United States must continue to support efforts to establish peace and democratic rule in Burma. And it is my hope that by honoring Aung San Suu Kyi with the Congressional Gold Medal, we will continue to pressure the junta to release her and bring freedom and democracy to the people of Burma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aung San Suu Kyi's work on behalf of the Burmese people has already been recognized by many on the international stage. She has won over 60 international awards, including the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought from the European Union, the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the United States, and the Nobel Peace Prize. She is also the world's only imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize recipient, spending more than 12 of the last 17 years under house arrest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aung San Suu Kyi and the people of Burma are leading a courageous nonviolent struggle for human rights and democracy, values we share as Americans. Her passionate, nonviolent approach and commitment to a free democratic Burma has won the hearts and minds of the people of Burma and, I dare say, the rest of the free world. Today I believe we should show her and the rest of the world that she is also in the hearts and minds of the Members of the U.S. Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A number of my colleagues deserve special thanks for helping me bring this message to the floor today, including my good friend from Illinois (Mr. Manzullo) for working with me to make this a bipartisan measure. Also, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Financial Services Committee Chairman BARNEY FRANK and Ranking Member Bachus deserve my thanks and our thanks in helping to ensure speedy consideration of the bill. Additionally, at the staff level, I want to thank  Nien Su, Joe Pinder, Jonathan Obee and Greg Sheiowitz from my staff for their help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400252" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support this very important effort to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Aung San Suu Kyi. She is one of the most honorable advocates for democracy and human rights the world will ever know. Ms. Suu Kyi is the world's only Nobel Peace Prize winner to remain a political prisoner. Ironically, the daughter  of Burma's revolutionary hero is herself a captive in the very country that her  father freed from colonial rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to take this opportunity to thank my colleague and good friend from New York (Mr. Crowley) for being a leader on such an important matter. His drive and commitment to awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to Ms. Suu Kyi is not only impressive, but it is a true testament to his character. I am honored that he reached out to me to help drive this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Burma's military junta has held Aung San Suu Kyi captive for most of the 18 years she has spent inside that country. In fact, she was placed under house arrest in 1989, after she formed the National League for Democracy. And even after that party won the decisive election in 1990, with Ms. Suu Kyi elected as Prime Minister, the junta continues to not recognize the election results and the fact that the people have spoken. Except for brief occasions, Ms. Suu Kyi has remained a prisoner.  She even was not allowed to attend her husband's funeral and remains separated from her children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In September of this year, the Burmese people held the largest peaceful protests that country has seen in the past 20 years. They protested the poor economic decisions of the junta as well as the continued denial of democratic and human rights of the Burmese people. An estimated 100,000 people marched through Rangoon, peacefully demanding the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. The world watched and hoped that this time the Saffron Revolution would lead to meaningful change. But, rather than listening  to its people, the regime of Than Shwe turned its guns against the people, as they did in 1988. The U.N. Special Envoy for Human Rights reported recently that at least 31 people were killed in September and over 1,000 people remain incarcerated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, we gathered here in this House to pass a bill sponsored by two champions of freedom, my good friends Mr. Lantos, chairman, and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The Block Burmese JADE Act of 2007 can be an important tool to add even more pressure to the regime to change its ways, particularly if our government encourages more countries to adopt similar economic sanctions. I note that the European Union is following a similar  approach in response to the killings. Even Burma's immediate neighbors have issued strong statements condemning the massacre.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American people are outraged and disgusted by the severe use of force on the protestors and the continued detention of Aung San Suu Kyi. Shortly after the protest, the Subcommittee on Asia, Pacific, and Global Environment, on which I serve as ranking Republican member, with Congressman ENI FALEOMAVAEGA as chairman, held a hearing on the situation in Burma. We heard dramatic testimony from experts within the administration and from nongovernmental organizations. All the  witnesses agree that Burma's fall from a prosperous country to pariah state was a direct consequence of the dictatorship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that is why we are here today, to state for the record that it is time the military junta recognize the will of the Burmese people, and of most countries of the world, and open the door for true reconciliation. By awarding Ms. Suu Kyi the Congressional Gold Medal, we Americans send a strong message that totalitarianism in Burma needs to come to an end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all Members to support <bill type="h" number="4286">H.R. 4286</bill> so that we can voice our full support for Burma's first daughter and for all the people of Burma. This will remind the military junta of the American people's unwavering support for Aung San Suu Kyi. We need to pass the bill so there can be no mistaking our support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400087" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as the gentleman may consume to my good friend, ENI FALEOMAVAEGA.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to commend and thank the gentleman from New York for his sponsorship of this important legislation. I also want to commend my good friend, the ranking member of our Asia, Pacific Subcommittee, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Manzullo) for allowing bipartisanship of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in full support of <bill type="h" number="4286">H.R. 4286</bill>, a bill to award Ms. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi the Congressional Gold Medal for her dedication, her service, and unwavering commitment and courage to stand up against the forces of military rule on the people of Burma. For over 10 years now, Ms. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has been placed under house arrest by the military regime of Burma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will submit that there are a lot of complications here on the situation with Burma. Burma continues to exist under very difficult conditions whereby seven to eight ethnic factions are constantly competing for the control of that country. In fact, it was even so bad that even the British could not control them under their colonial rule. As such, the military organization now claims, and continues to claim, that it is the only group or organization that is keeping the country together  and, without the military, Burma would be in a state of civil war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to say that that is the very heart and problem that we face with Burma today; the fact that there are about seven to eight different ethnic groups within the country that could never be controlled by one group. And I want to say that, as the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, Ms. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi continues to make every effort to work with the military regime to see the possibility of democracy ever to return to Burma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my sincere hope that, in the coming weeks and months, Ms. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her military counterparts will work out a compromise solution, hopefully, to establish a democratic form of government for the people of Burma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to again commend my good friend, the gentleman from New York, for his authorship of this bill and, most appropriately, to honor this great leader Ms. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi with the Congressional Gold Medal. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400252" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400087" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank once again Mr. Manzullo for his support and efforts in helping to bring this legislation in a bipartisan spirit to the floor today. I want to thank my friend again Mr. Faleomavaega for his comments and work as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no question that the situation in Burma is complex. One only needs to read today's Washington Post to understand again the complexity of this in terms of the ethnic diversity within Burma. Also, in reading that article today, one could also understand that there's incredible turmoil within that country where there are more child soldiers than any other country today; where every day, daily, young boys are coerced and enslaved by conditions into becoming soldiers as young boys and children.  There are over 2,000 political prisoners that we know of today in Burma. And that same article today alluded to the destruction of villages in Burma. Let me just point out that over 200 ethnic minority villages have been destroyed by the military junta, forcing 1.5 million people to flee their homes, some to flee the country, in a country where rape is used as a weapon by the military regime against the ethnic minorities within that country, documented and well known.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aung San Suu Kyi, if she receives this award this year, will receive the award the same year that we just gave this to the Dalai Lama, the same award, the Gold Medal. She is known in Burma and throughout the world as the Nelson Mandela of Burma. She is known as the Gandhi of Burma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I think it is appropriate that this year she share the limelight in some way with the Dalai Lama who himself has brought attention to the cause of the people of his own land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me close by saying just one other point about Aung San Suu Kyi and the sacrifices she has had to make, giving up of her personal freedom and opportunity to live in Great Britain, India or elsewhere. She has turned that down to be with her own people who are suffering to the point where she is not permitted to see her family members because of her involvement in human rights activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1999, when her husband was dying, the military regime refused to allow him to live with her during that time. She had to spend those terrible days in isolation from the person she loved more than anyone else, her dying husband.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also important to note that Aung San Suu Kyi received the Nobel Peace Prize. But quite frankly, that was done in 1991, a very long time ago; some 16 years ago she received that award. So I believe that the work that the administration is doing, the work that the First Lady, and again I want to congratulate First Lady Laura Bush for her continued effort to bringing light and attention to this particular issue, I think it is having an effect on the world. I think more of the world is interested  in what is happening in Burma and paying attention to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to take this time to ask our friends in India to play more of an active role in bringing about a constructive solution to the issues of Burma. And again to China, a country that I believe has continued to turn its face away from atrocities, no longer should China turn her face away from what is happening in Burma. China, India, Bangladesh, all of the countries in the region need to be concerned about what is happening in Burma today. Again, it is about what makes America America,  standing up for those countries that stand up for democracy and human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present this legislation to the House floor and hope my colleagues support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
