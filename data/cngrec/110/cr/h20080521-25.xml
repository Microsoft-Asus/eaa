    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week, Congress, with strong Democratic support, passed the new GI Bill, which provides all veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars the promise of a full 4-year college scholarship. The bill makes veterans a part of the American economic recovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The original GI Bill in 1944 allowed millions of families to achieve the American Dream. It also set our economy on the right course after World War II. For every dollar spent on the GI Bill, $7 were returned to the economy. A similar economic spark is needed today. You would think that the new GI Bill would gain the support of President Bush. But he opposes it. Unfortunately, the vast majority of House Republicans opposed the bill when it was on the floor last week. We must make sure that the  brave men and women that we are sending off to battle have everything they need and deserve when they return home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Democrats vow to never leave a veteran behind after returning from war by ensuring that they receive the quality care and benefits they have earned. That includes living up to the promise of providing them access to quality higher education.</paragraph>
