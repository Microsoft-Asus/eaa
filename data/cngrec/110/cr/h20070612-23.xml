    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this year and in years past, the Bush administration has neglected the needs of America's veterans. In his annual budget request, the President did not propose enough funding for the Veterans Administration to meet the growing needs of our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, the new Democratic Congress did not forget about our veterans. This week, we will bring a Military Construction and Veterans' Affairs Appropriations bill to the floor that provides the largest increase in veterans' health care funding in history. Our bill includes $600 million for a new initiative for mental health and post-traumatic stress syndrome, so that we can ensure that our veterans and returning soldiers have the facilities and the care they need. The funding bill also provides  essential services that will allow these veterans to transition back into their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats know that the Federal Government must keep its promises to the men and women who have defended our Nation. This bill, I am proud to say, lives up to that promise.</paragraph>
