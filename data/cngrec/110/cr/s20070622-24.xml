  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, minutes ago a new Senator for the State of Wyoming was officially appointed by the Governor of Wyoming, and I want to welcome Dr. John Barrasso, now Senator Barrasso, and introduce him to the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John is an extremely capable person who has gone through a selection process that involved 30 people who were interested in serving as Senator. He went through an interview process and a selection process and was one of three people given to the Governor from whom to select. The Governor gave each of the people a list of 42 issues of critical interest to the State of Wyoming and interviewed each of them and made a selection on that basis. Dr. John Barrasso was the selection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very excited about this. I am excited about having a full roster from Wyoming. I have known John for many years. I was pleased that he ran for the State Senate. He worked on a lot of conservative issues there. He was a  hard worker, and he was extremely efficient. In fact, one of the amazing things to me was that he was able to answer every e-mail almost immediately and to keep his desk clean. It is different from the way I worked when I  was in the Wyoming legislature and it is much different than the way my desk looks here. So his efficiency is unmatched, and he has great knowledge of Wyoming and the issues that are important in Wyoming, which include energy, and of course health. He is an orthopedic surgeon and will make a big difference in our health care debate back here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is quiet but efficient and has worked across the aisle in Wyoming, and I am sure he will continue to do that here, much the way Senator Thomas and I have done. We have always worked as a team, the Wyoming delegation, and he will become a very strong team member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to congratulate the Wyoming Republican Party on the process they went through. I want to particularly congratulate Fred Parady, who is the State chairman, for the way he walked into some fairly uncharted waters, particularly for that many people who were interested. He did an excellent and fair job, and one that was timely so we would be able to get to this point. He did an outstanding job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the Governor for the care and concern he gave and the way he went about his job and the comments he made as he did that job and as he introduced the new Senator. I think Wyoming can be a good example for the rest of the Nation to follow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, no one is going to be able to replace Craig Thomas, but working with John, we can ensure the representation of Wyoming in the Senate will remain second to none.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John has had some interesting things he has worked on in Wyoming. He is extremely well known across the State because he has been doing virtually a nightly television spot helping people to help their own health and has given tips for a number of years doing that. I have no idea how many years he has also been the host for the Jerry Lewis telethon for Wyoming and has raised innumerable dollars for that great cause, and he does it so easily and so naturally and is such a great speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, he is very pleased that both of his children, Pete and Emma, have graduated from high school. Emma graduated this year. So he has gotten to watch them grow up in a very involved way through the years, and now that they are going to college, he can come to Washington, and I know he and his family are very excited about it and are great participants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I welcome the newest member of the Senate and let everyone know we are looking forward to a great team and his extreme capability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
