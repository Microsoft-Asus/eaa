  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I begin by thanking the staff for staying a few extra minutes to enable me to come back to the floor to make a short statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have sought recognition to speak about a revised reform bill on immigration. In the course of the past 3 years, the Senate has spent a great deal of time on trying to reform our immigration system: to begin to fix the broken borders; to add more Border Patrols; to undertake some necessary fencing; to add drones; to undertake employer verification by utilizing identification which now can provide, with certainty, whether an immigrant is legal or illegal; to take care of a guest worker program  to fill employment needs in the United States; and to deal with the 12 million undocumented immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the 109th Congress, when I chaired the Judiciary Committee, we reported out a bill. It came to the floor, and after considerable debate it was passed. The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation directed only at border patrol and employer verification, and for a variety of reasons we could not reconcile the bills and enact legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year a different procedure was undertaken: to have a group of Senators who had been deeply involved in the issue before craft a bill. It did not go through committee, and, as I said earlier on the floor, I think it probably was a mistake because the committee action of hearings and markups and refinement works out a lot of problems. At any rate, as we all know, after extensive debate, the bill went down. We could not get cloture to proceed, and it was defeated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was defeated for a number of reasons. But I believe the immigration issue is one of great national concern--great importance--and ought to be revisited by the Congress and that ought to be done at as early a time as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a very serious problem with people coming across our borders--a criminal element, and a potential terrorist element. The rule of law is broken by people who come here in violation of our laws. We have continuing problems from the 1986 legislation that employer verification is not realistic because there is no positive way of identification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No matter how high the borders or the value of border patrol, it is not possible to eliminate illegal immigration if the magnet is present. The legislation I will be putting in as part of the Record at the conclusion of my remarks is a draft of suggested proposals to be considered by the Senate. There are two major changes which have been undertaken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much as I dislike to, I have eliminated the automatic path to citizenship but instead deal with the fugitive status of the undocumented immigrants, the 12 million, and eliminate that fugitive status. Whether it is categorized as permanent legal resident or some other category, as a matter of nomenclature it can be worked out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the principal concern has not been the citizenship, although it is a desirable factor to try to integrate the 12 million into our society. But the principal concern has been that when an undocumented illegal immigrant sees a policeman on the street, there is fear of apprehension and being rounded up and deported, or the undocumented illegal is at the mercy of an unscrupulous employer who will take advantage of them and they cannot report to the police the treatment or a violation of law by  an employer because they are fearful of being arrested and deported. In many places you cannot rent an apartment or undertake other activities. So I think eliminating the fugitive status is a major improvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other significant change is to not tamper with or change family unification but to leave it as it is now. We had come up with, with the bill which was defeated, an elaborate point system for immigration. It was our best effort but, candidly, it turned out to be half-baked. It did not go through the hearing process to hear from experts. It did not have that kind of refinement and raised a lot of problems. That could be revisited at a later date. I have worked with the so-called interest groups  representing immigration interests and have had what I consider to be a relatively good response.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not want to characterize it or put words in anybody's mouth. There is a certain reluctance to make any more concessions because concessions were made last year and the bottom fell out. So they made an inquiry, understandably so, that there be some realistic chance of getting the bill passed if they are to give up a path to citizenship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have undertaken to talk to many of my colleagues, Senators who opposed the bill, to get a sense from them as to whether, with the automatic path to citizenship out, and dealing only with the fugitive status, that there might be some greater willingness to find an accommodation and deal with the issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to citizenship, even under the legislation that was defeated, there would not be an opportunity for citizenship until at least 8 years have passed, to take care of the backlog, and then another 5 years to work out the 12 million undocumented immigrants. So the citizenship, even under the bill which was defeated, was not something which was going to be imminent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen local governments and State governments trying to deal with the issue. Reports are more than 100 laws have been passed and ordinances enacted which would deal with the immigration problem. They cannot do it on a sensible basis. Last week the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania handed down an opinion that the city of Hazelton, notwithstanding the understandable efforts by the mayor, program was not constitutional; that under our laws, the answer has to come  from the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen a lot of unrest on the issue. The front page of the Washington Post the day before yesterday had a report about groups of immigrants feeling that they had been mistreated. There was an uneasiness on all sides, uneasiness by people who are angry about the violation of our borders, by immigrants who think they are not being fairly treated, and a grave concern about the availability of workers on our farms across America, concerns of the hotel industry and landscapers and restaurateurs  about the adequacy of our labor force. So there is no doubt that this is a very significant issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week I circulated to my 99 colleagues a letter, and one page summarizing the study bill--I will call it a study bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the draft proposal and the one-page letter circulated to all other Senators be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <narrative>(See exhibit 1.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>In conclusion, I emphasize that I am inviting suggestions and comments for improving the bill. The one view that I do have, very strongly, is that it is our pay grade to deal with this issue. Only the Congress can deal with the immigration problem, and it is a matter of tremendous importance that we do so. We obviously cannot satisfy everyone, but I invite analysis, criticism, and modification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see my distinguished colleague from Vermont, one of my distinguished colleagues from Vermont, awaiting recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Exhibit 1</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. SENATE,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe it is possible to enact comprehensive immigration reform in this Congress, perhaps even in this calendar year, if we make two significant changes in the bill we recently had on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, a new bill should eliminate the automatic path to citizenship for the approximately 12 million undocumented immigrants. Instead, we should just eliminate the fugitive status for the 12 million so that they would not be fearful every time they see a policeman, be protected from unscrupulous employers who threaten to turn them in if they don't do the employer's bidding, and be free to do things like rent apartments in cities which now preclude that. From soundings I have taken from many  senators, that should take the teeth out of the amnesty argument, which was the principal reason for the defeat of the last bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, we should not tamper with the current provisions on family unity with the elaborate point system which was insufficiently thought through. If that is to be ultimately accomplished, we need hearings and a more thoughtful approach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, although not indispensable, I believe we should provide more green cards to assist the hitech community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The enclosed draft bill covers these three changes and also includes the guest worker program, the increased border security and enhanced employer verification in the last bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because it will be easier to get real border security if we deal with the 12 million undocumented immigrants, I think this proposal presents an alternate and plausible path to achieve comprehensive immigration reform now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have discussed this proposal with the senators who were part of the core negotiating group and with the relevant interest groups and have received a generally favorable response and, in many cases, an enthusiastic response. Similarly, in discussing the proposed bill with the dissenters, I have heard no strenuous adverse response so I believe it is worthy of a repeat effort. Although the defeat of the bill on the Senate floor was a major disappointment, I think that we proponents of comprehensive  immigration reform have significant momentum and these changes, perhaps supplemented by other modifications, could put us over the top.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>"(III) such other information as the Secretary may require to determine the identity and work authorization of an employee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(iii) PRESENTATION OF DOCUMENTATION.--The employer, and the individual whose identity and employment eligibility are being confirmed, shall fulfill the requirements of subsection (c) of this section.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(iv) PRESENTATION OF BIOMETRICS.--Employers who are enrolled in the Voluntary Advanced Verification Program to Combat Identity Theft under section 307 of this Title shall, in addition to documentary evidence of identity and work eligibility, electronically provide the fingerprints of the individual to the Department of Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(B) Seeking confirmation.--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(i) The employer shall use the EEVS to provide to the Secretary all required information in order to obtain confirmation of the identity and employment eligibility of any individual no earlier than the date of hire and no later than on the first day of employment (or recruitment or referral, as the case may be). An employer may not, however, make the starting date of an individual's employment contingent on the receipt of a confirmation of the identity and employment eligibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(ii) For reverification of an employee with a limited period of work authorization (including Z card holder), all required verification procedures must be complete on the date the employee's work authorization expires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(iii) For initial verification of an employee hired before the employer is subject to the employment eligibility verification system, all required procedures must be complete on such date as the Secretary shall specify in accordance with subparagraph (d)(2)(D).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(iv) The Secretary shall provide, and the employer shall utilize, as part of EEVS, a method of communicating notices and requests for information or action on the part of the employer with respect to expiring work authorization or status and other matters. Additionally, the Secretary shall provide a method of notifying employers of a  confirmation, nonconfirmation or a notice that further action is required (`further action notice'). The employer shall  communicate to the individual that is the subject of the verification all information provided to the employer by the EEVS for communication to the individual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(C) Confirmation or nonconfirmation.--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(i) INITIAL RESPONSE.--The verification system shall provide a confirmation, a nonconfirmation, or a further action notice of an individual's identity and employment eligibility at the time of the inquiry, unless for technological reasons or due to unforeseen circumstances, the EEVS is unable to provide such confirmation or further action notice. In such situations, the system shall provide confirmation or further action notice within 3 business days of the initial inquiry. If providing  confirmation or further action notice, the EEVS shall provide an appropriate code indicating such confirmation or such further action notice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(ii) CONFIRMATION UPON INITIAL INQUIRY.--When the employer receives an appropriate confirmation of an individual's identity and work eligibility under the EEVS, the employer shall record the confirmation in such manner as the Secretary may specify.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(iii) Further action notice upon initial inquiry and secondary verification--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(I) FURTHER ACTION NOTICE.--If the employer receives a further action notice of an individual's identity or work eligibility under the EEVS, the employer shall inform the individual without delay for whom the confirmation is sought of the further action notice and any procedures specified by the Secretary for addressing the further action notice. The employee must acknowledge in writing the receipt of the further action notice from the employer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(II) CONTEST.--Within ten business days from the date of notification to the employee, the employee must contact the appropriate agency to contest the further action notice and, if the Secretary so requires, appear in person at the appropriate Federal or state agency for purposes of verifying the individual's identity and employment authorization. The Secretary, in consultation with the Commissioner of Social Security and other appropriate Federal and State agencies, shall specify an  available secondary verification procedure to confirm the validity of information provided and to provide a final confirmation or nonconfirmation. An individual contesting a further action notice must attest under penalty of perjury to his identity and employment authorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(III) NO CONTEST.--If the individual does not contest the further action notice within the period specified in subparagraph (5)(C)(iii)(II), a final nonconfirmation shall issue. The employer shall then record the nonconfirmation in such manner as the Secretary may specify.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(IV) FINALITY.--The EEVS shall provide a final confirmation or nonconfirmation within 10 business days from the date of the employee's contesting of the further action notice. As long as the employee is taking the steps required by the Secretary and the agency that the employee has contacted to resolve a further action notice, the Secretary shall extend the period of investigation until the secondary verification procedure allows the Secretary to provide a final confirmation or nonconfirmation.  If the employee fails to take the steps required by the Secretary and the appropriate agency, a final nonconfirmation may be issued to that employee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(V) RE-EXAMINATION.--Nothing in this section shall prevent the Secretary from reexamining a case where a final confirmation has been provided if subsequently received information indicates that the individual may not be work authorized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"In no case shall an employer terminate employment of an individual solely because of a failure of the individual to have identity and work eligibility confirmed under this section until a nonconfirmation becomes final and the period to timely file an administrative appeal has passed, and in the case where an administrative appeal has been denied, the period to timely file a petition for judicial review has passed. When final confirmation or nonconfirmation is provided, the confirmation system  shall provide an appropriate code indicating such confirmation or nonconfirmation. An individual's failure to contest a further action notice shall not be considered an admission of guilt with respect to any violation of this section or any provision of law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(D) Consequences of nonconfirmation.--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(i) TERMINATION OF CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT.--If the employer has received a final nonconfirmation regarding an individual, the employer shall terminate employment (or recruitment or referral) of the individual, unless the individual files an administrative appeal of a final nonconfirmation notice under paragraph (7) within the time period prescribed in that paragraph and the Secretary or the Commissioner stays the final nonconfirmation notice pending the resolution of the administrative  appeal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(ii) CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT AFTER FINAL NONCONFIRMATION.--If the employer continues to employ (or to recruit or refer) an individual after receiving final nonconfirmation (unless the individual filed an  administrative appeal of a final nonconfirmation notice under paragraph (7) within the time period prescribed in that paragraph and the Secretary of the Commissioner stayed the final nonconfirmation notice pending the resolution of the administrative appeal), a rebuttable presumption is created that the employer has violated subsections (a)(1)(A) and (a)(2) of this section. The previous sentence shall not apply in any prosecution under subsection (f)(1) of this section.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(E) Obligation to respond to queries and additional information.--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(i) Employers are required to comply with requests from the Secretary through EEVS for information, including queries concerning current and former employees that relate to the functioning of the EEVS, the accuracy of the responses provided by the EEVS, and any suspected fraud or identity theft in the use of the EEVS. Failure to comply with such a request is a violation of section (a)(1)(B).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(ii) Individuals being verified through EEVS may be required to take further action to address irregularities identified in the documents relied upon for purposes of employment verification. The employer shall communicate to the individual any such requirement for further actions and shall record the date and manner of such communication. The individual must acknowledge in writing the receipt of this communication from the employer. Failure to communicate such a requirement is a violation of  section (a)(1)(B).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(iii) The Secretary is authorized, with notice to the public provided in the Federal Register, to implement, clarify, and supplement the requirements of this paragraph in order to facilitate the functioning of the EEVS or to prevent fraud or identity theft in the use of the EEVS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(F) Impermissible use of the eevs.--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(i) An employer may not use the EEVS to verify an individual prior to extending to the individual an offer of employment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(ii) An employer may not require an individual to verify the individual's own employment eligibility through the EEVS as a condition of extending to that individual an offer of employment. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent an employer from encouraging an employee or a prospective employee from verifying the employee's or a prospective employee's own employment eligibility prior to obtaining employment pursuant to paragraph (5)(H).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(iii) An employer may not terminate an individual's employment solely because that individual has been issued a further action notice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(iv) An employer may not take the following actions solely because an individual has been issued a further action notice:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(I) reduce salary, bonuses or other compensation due to the employee;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(II) suspend the employee without pay;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(III) reduce the hours that the employee is required to work if such reduction is accompanied by a reduction in salary, bonuses or other compensation due to the employee, except that, with the agreement of the employee, an employer may provide an employee with reasonable time off without pay in order to contest and resolve the further action notice received by the employee;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(IV) deny the employee the training necessary to perform the employment duties for which the employee has been hired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(v) An employer may not, in the course of utilizing the procedures for document verification set forth in subsection (c), require that a prospective employee present additional documents or different documents than those prescribed under that subsection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(vi) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall develop the necessary policies and procedures to monitor employers' use of the EEVS and their compliance with the requirements set forth in this section. Employers are required to comply with requests from the Secretary for information related to any monitoring, audit or investigation undertaken pursuant to this subparagraph.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(vii) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, shall establish and maintain a process by which any employee (or any prospective employee who would otherwise have been hired) who has reason to believe that an employer has violated subparagraphs (i)-(v) may file a complaint against the employer.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>"(b) MINIMUM BENEFITS, WAGES, AND WORKING CONDITIONS.--Except in cases where higher benefits, wages, or working conditions are required by the provisions of subsection (a), in order to protect similarly employed United States workers from adverse effects with respect to benefits, wages, and working conditions, every job offer which shall accompany an application under section 218C(b)(2) shall include each of the following benefit, wage, and working condition provisions:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(1) REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE HOUSING OR A HOUSING ALLOWANCE.--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(A) IN GENERAL.--An employer applying under section 218C(a) for H-2A workers shall offer to provide housing at no cost to all workers in job opportunities for which the employer has applied under that section and to all other workers in the same occupation at the place of employment, whose place of residence is beyond normal commuting distance.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>"(i) CHARGES FOR PUBLIC HOUSING.--If public housing provided for migrant agricultural workers under the auspices of a local, county, or State government is secured by an employer, and use of the public housing unit normally requires charges from migrant workers, such charges shall be paid by the employer directly to the appropriate individual or entity affiliated with the housing's management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(ii) DEPOSIT CHARGES.--Charges in the form of deposits for bedding or other similar incidentals related to housing shall not be levied upon workers by employers who provide housing for their workers.

    <paragraph>"(G) HOUSING ALLOWANCE AS ALTERNATIVE.--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(i) IN GENERAL.--If the requirement set out in clause (ii) is satisfied, the employer may provide a reasonable housing allowance instead of offering housing under subparagraph (A).

An employer who offers a housing allowance to a worker, or assists a worker in locating housing which  the worker occupies, pursuant to this clause shall not be deemed a housing provider under section 203 of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (29 U.S.C. 1823) solely by virtue of providing such housing allowance. No housing allowance may be used for housing which is owned or controlled by the employer.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>"(B) FROM PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT.--A worker who completes the period of employment for the job opportunity involved shall be reimbursed by the employer for the cost of the worker's transportation and subsistence from the place of employment to the place from which the worker, disregarding intervening employment, came to work for the employer, or to the place of next employment, if the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has not agreed to provide or pay for the worker's transportation  and subsistence to such subsequent employer's place of employment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>"(ii) DISTANCE TRAVELED.--No reimbursement under subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be required if the distance traveled is 100 miles or less, or the worker is not residing in employer-provided housing or housing secured through an allowance as provided in paragraph (1)(G).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(D) EARLY TERMINATION.--If the worker is laid off or employment is terminated for contract impossibility (as described in paragraph (4)(D)) before the anticipated ending date of employment, the employer shall provide the transportation and subsistence required by subparagraph (B) and, notwithstanding whether the worker has completed 50 percent of the period of employment, shall provide the transportation reimbursement required by subparagraph (A).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>(2) Mexico comprises a prime source of migration to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(3) Remittances from Mexican citizens working in the United States reached a record high of nearly $17,000,000,000 in 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(4) Migration patterns may be reduced from Mexico to the United States by addressing the degree of economic opportunity available to Mexican citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(5) Many Mexican assets are held extralegally and cannot be readily used as collateral for loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(6) A majority of Mexican businesses are small or medium size with limited access to financial capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(7) These factors constitute a major impediment to broadbased economic growth in Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(8) Approximately 20 percent of Mexico's population works in agriculture, with the majority of this population working on small farms and few on large commercial enterprises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(9) The Partnership for Prosperity is a bilateral initiative launched jointly by the President of the United States and the President of Mexico in 2001, which aims to boost the social and economic standards of Mexican citizens, particularly in regions where economic growth has lagged and emigration has increased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(10) The Presidents of Mexico and the United States and the Prime Minister of Canada, at their trilateral summit on March 23, 2005, agreed to promote economic growth, competitiveness, and quality of life in the agreement on Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PARTNERSHIP FOR PROSPERITY.--It is the sense of Congress that the United States and Mexico should accelerate the implementation of the Partnership for Prosperity to help generate economic growth and improve the standard of living in Mexico, which will lead to reduced migration, by--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(1) increasing access for poor and under served populations in Mexico to the financial services sector, including credit unions;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) assisting Mexican efforts to formalize its extra-legal sector, including the issuance of formal land titles, to enable Mexican citizens to use their assets to procure capital;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(3) facilitating Mexican efforts to establish an effective rural lending system for small- and medium-sized farmers that will--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(A) provide long term credit to borrowers;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(B) develop a viable network of regional and local intermediary lending institutions; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(C) extend financing for alternative rural economic activities beyond direct agricultural production;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(4) expanding efforts to reduce the transaction costs of remittance flows in order to increase the pool of savings available to help finance domestic investment in Mexico;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(5) encouraging Mexican corporations to adopt internationally recognized corporate governance practices, including anti-corruption and transparency principles;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(6) enhancing Mexican efforts to strengthen governance at all levels, including efforts to improve transparency and accountability, and to eliminate corruption, which is the single biggest obstacle to development;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(7) assisting the Government of Mexico in implementing all provisions of the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption (ratified by Mexico on May 27, 1997) and urging the Government of Mexico to participate fully in the Convention's formal implementation monitoring mechanism;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(8) helping the Government of Mexico to strengthen education and training opportunities throughout the country, with a particular emphasis on improving rural education; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(9) encouraging the Government of Mexico to create incentives for persons who have migrated to the United States to return to Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(c) SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING BILATERAL PARTNERSHIP ON HEALTH CARE.--It is the sense of Congress that the Government of the United States and the Government of Mexico should enter into a partnership to examine uncompensated and burdensome health care costs incurred by the United States due to legal and illegal immigration, including--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(1) increasing health care access for poor and under served populations in Mexico;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) assisting Mexico in increasing its emergency and trauma health care facilities along the border, with emphasis on expanding prenatal care in the United States-Mexico border region;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(3) facilitating the return of stable, incapacitated workers temporarily employed in the United States to Mexico in order to receive extended, long-term care in their home country; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(4) helping the Government of Mexico to establish a program with the private sector to cover the health care needs of Mexican nationals temporarily employed in the United States.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>"(E) Exhaustion and stay of proceedings.--No claim brought under this paragraph shall require the plaintiff to exhaust administrative remedies under subsection 603 of Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, but nothing shall prevent the court from staying proceedings under this paragraph to permit the Secretary to evaluate an allegation of an unwritten policy or practice or to take corrective action.

    <paragraph>(b) AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.--Amounts appropriated pursuant to subsection (a) shall remain available until expended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This title may be cited as the "Wartime Treatment Study Act".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress makes the following findings:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(1) During World War II, the United States Government deemed as "enemy aliens" more than 600,000 Italian-born and 300,000 German-born United States resident aliens and their families and required them to carry Certificates of Identification and limited their travel and personal property rights. At that time, these groups were the 2 largest foreign-born groups in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) During World War II, the United States Government arrested, interned, or otherwise detained thousands of European Americans, some remaining in custody for years after cessation of World War II hostilities, and repatriated, exchanged, or deported European Americans, including American-born children, to European Axis nations, many to be exchanged for Americans held in those nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(3) Pursuant to a policy coordinated by the United States with Latin American nations, many European Latin Americans, including German and Austrian Jews, were arrested, brought to the United States, and interned. Many were later expatriated, repatriated, or deported to European Axis nations during World War II, many to be exchanged for Americans and Latin Americans held in those nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(4) Millions of European Americans served in the armed forces and thousands sacrificed their lives in defense of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(5) The wartime policies of the United States Government were devastating to the Italian American and German American communities, individuals, and their families. The detrimental effects are still being experienced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(6) Prior to and during World War II, the United States restricted the entry of Jewish refugees who were fleeing persecution or genocide and sought safety in the United States. During the 1930s and 1940s, the quota system, immigration regulations, visa requirements, and the time required to process visa applications affected the number of Jewish refugees, particularly those from Germany and Austria, who could gain admittance to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(7) The United States Government should conduct an independent review to fully assess and acknowledge these actions. Congress has previously reviewed the United States Government's wartime treatment of Japanese Americans through the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians. An independent review of the treatment of German Americans and Italian Americans and of Jewish refugees fleeing persecution and genocide has not yet been undertaken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(8) Time is of the essence for the establishment of commissions, because of the increasing danger of destruction and loss of relevant documents, the advanced age of potential witnesses and, most importantly, the advanced age of those affected by the United States Government's policies. Many who suffered have already passed away and will never know of this effort.</paragraph>
