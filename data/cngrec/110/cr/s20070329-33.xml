    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of my longtime friend and staff member, Sue Glynn. After serving on my staff in the Michigan State Legislature, the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, Sue has decided to join her husband, Dale, in a well-deserved retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before joining my staff, Sue worked for the Michigan Democratic Party and other members of the Michigan State Legislature. I consider myself very fortunate that she chose to be a part of my staff and stay with me for over 20 years. She has worn many hats while working for me, including scheduler, regional manager and office manager. She has handled each one with professionalism and grace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sue is well known for her incredible organizational skills, and I have relied on her in so many ways. She is leaving very big shoes to fill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both Sue and her husband have dedicated themselves to public service--Sue in government and Dale with the public school system. As a couple and individually, they are well-respected community leaders. I know their commitment will continue into retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My staff and I will miss her presence in the office and her outstanding work ethic. She is a woman of strong values and integrity. She approaches her work in a serious manner but also is very fun-loving. I know that the many people in Michigan, whose lives she has touched through her work, will miss her as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon leaving the Senate, Sue has many exciting plans and will probably be busier than she is now. She enjoys golfing, bowling, gardening, spending time with her daughter and son and their families, traveling and being with friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am sad because I am losing a trusted and valued member of my staff, but I am happy to see a dear friend move on to new life experiences after a long and distinguished career. She deserves the best of everything and I will always value our friendship in the years to come.</paragraph>
