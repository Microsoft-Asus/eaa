  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO JOHNNIE CARR -- (Senate - March 04, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1520">S1520</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with sadness that today I note the loss of a great American and a hero of the civil rights movement, Mrs. Johnnie Carr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Carr passed away in Montgomery on February 22, 2008, at the age of 97, but her lifelong struggle for equality in America will be an inspiration for many years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the great privilege to know Mrs. Carr personally. I was always struck by her deep faith and commitment to improving our State. She was an independent thinker, and her remarkable strength served her well as a leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Carr lived all her life in Montgomery, where she was a foot soldier in the fight for equality. She was a founding member of the Montgomery Improvement Association, an organization that proved instrumental in the important civil rights events in Alabama during the 1950s and 1960s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Carr was the schoolmate, friend, and partner of Rosa Parks, who was the recipient of the Congressional Gold Medal and who was honored, 2 years ago, by having her body lie in honor in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fred Gray, lawyer for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and author of "Bus Ride to Justice," a valuable history of the civil rights movement in Alabama, points out that Johnnie Carr was one of the organizers of the bus protest. Gray eloquently notes that her boycott "Set in motion the modern civil rights movement and gave birth to a world leader, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a future Nobel Peace Prize Laureate." That protest succeeded as a result of unified African-American community leaders like  Johnnie Carr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later, in 1964, Carr became the lead plaintiff in the historic school desegregation case, Carr v. the Montgomery Board of Education, a victory for color-blind public education and one of many important cases heard by U.S. District Judge Frank M. Johnson. Indeed, this case was the first time that the U.S. Supreme Court approved "quotas, goals, and time-tables" as corrections for past discrimination, Gray writes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She committed her entire life to equality and her faith, which provided her the courage to make a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is fitting that Mrs. Carr followed Dr. King as president of the Montgomery Improvement Association. For more than four decades she led campaigns to promote voter registration and integrate public facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Always a strong leader, Mrs. Carr promoted cooperation and consensus during a difficult period in our Nation's history. She reached across racial lines to promote positive change for Alabama, serving as both an active member of Hall Street Baptist Church and as a missionary for the Montgomery Antioch District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many individuals and organizations have recognized Mrs. Carr's long history of leadership and advocacy. It is a privilege to lend my voice to the choir of those who have honored the spirit and dedication of this American hero. She left a lasting legacy in this country that will not soon be forgotten.</paragraph>
