    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take time to recognize Mr. John Hall of Middleton, WI, on being awarded the French Legion of Honor for his  extraordinary bravery in liberating France during the Second World War. The Legion of Honor is the highest honor awarded by the nation of France.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In December 1942, at the age of 18, Mr. Hall enlisted in the military. He took part in military campaigns in Italy, the Rhineland, and the south and east of France. He was wounded in September 1944.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Second World War has so much significance in modern history. An entire generation rallied together to defend the rights of freedom and liberty, not just for the United States but for the entire world. The world in which we live was shaped by the actions of these brave soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Hall is a member of our Greatest Generation that built modern America. Their efforts kept us safe and allowed our communities to flourish. These heroes were united in the common values of duty, honor, service and love of country. As a nation, we are forever grateful for the sacrifices and courage of these brave veterans of the Second World War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of our State and Nation, I congratulate Mr. John Hall and his family on this prestigious honor and thank him for his brave service.</paragraph>
