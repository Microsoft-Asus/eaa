    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Mohegan Indian Chief, Ralph W. Sturges. Chief Sturges died on September 30, 2007, in New London, Connecticut, at the age of 88.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lifelong resident of Connecticut, Chief Sturges was a renaissance man whose commitment to community and Nation knew no bounds. During his early life, he worked for the Civilian Conservation Corps and joined the U.S. Army's intelligence division during World War II, where he subsequently earned a Bronze Star for his outstanding service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the war, Chief Sturges worked tirelessly for Federal recognition of the Mohegan tribe, which finally occurred in 1992. Because of his efforts, he was elected "Chief for Life," which he faithfully worked as an ambassador of goodwill during the extraordinary growth of Mohegan Sun Resort and Casino as a world-class destination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While his passing brings sadness to the Connecticut community, his legacy and contributions will be remembered for generations to come. I ask my colleagues to join with me and my constituents to honor his life and offer condolences to his family.</paragraph>
