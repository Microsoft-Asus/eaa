  <narrative>SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10760]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. SESTAK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412232" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, entering my 31st year in the military, my single daughter, 4-year-old Alex, was struck with a malignant brain tumor. After two brain operations and given 3 to 9 months to live, we moved into a cancer ward and began a journey that has her here today and has me in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The incident that brought me here was, her roommate that day as she began her chemotherapy was a young 2 1/2 -year-old boy from Washington, DC. He was diagnosed that morning with acute leukemia, and for 6 hours we could not help but overhear as social workers came and went to see if that 2 1/2 -year-old boy could stay because his parents did not have health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been in combat. I have seen the worst of human nature. I have also seen the best of human nature. This SCHIP bill would cover 10 million uninsured Americans, that 2 1/2 -year-old boy, so that social worker does not determine whether some child is taken care of, is the best of our nature. I ask everyone to support the SCHIP bill.</paragraph>
