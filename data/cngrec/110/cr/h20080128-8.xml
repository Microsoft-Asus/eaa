    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I know we are going to be looking at economic stimulus packages, and we are going to be trying to jump-start and help our economy. It is my belief that one way that we can do that is to make sure that we provide a jobs training program for the 1 million young people across the country who don't have any money, no job, no employment, many of them are out of school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's consider a job training program for our young people as a part of the economic stimulus package.</paragraph>
