  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's my sad duty to inform the House of the death of former Member Joe D. Waggoner, Jr., from Louisiana. Congressman Waggoner served this House with distinction on the Ways and Means Committee, as a subcommittee chairman on the Ways and Means, served in the House for nearly 18 years, and Congressman Waggoner passed away this weekend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I would ask, in memory of Congressman Waggoner, for the House to please rise and have a moment of silence.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
