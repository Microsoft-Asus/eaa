    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Members of Congress, people of the United States of America, I stand this morning as chairperson of the Congressional Black Caucus to say thank you to the thousands of people who are in Jena, Louisiana as we speak, and the tens of thousands around this country standing for liberty and justice for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, a tragic accident happened in Jena, Louisiana. A gentleman has been incarcerated since December; the appeals court has thrown out the conviction; he is still incarcerated. Six young men attacked, two days before the incident that they are in jail for, and now we ask for justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important day in the history of our country. We rise, as we just said the Pledge of Allegiance, justice and liberty for all. Congratulations to the attorneys, to the coalition, to the families. Let's retry this in juvenile court where it ought to be and bring justice to the Jena 6. Congratulations, young men. Stand strong. We are with you. God bless.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
