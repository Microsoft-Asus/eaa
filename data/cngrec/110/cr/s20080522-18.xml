  <narrative>THINKING OF SENATOR KENNEDY -- (Senate - May 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4756">S4756</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say first I commend the remarks of the Senator from North Dakota who again reminds us of the importance of this legislation that we have been working on for many months now, and now having the votes, an overwhelming number of votes in the Senate to override the President's veto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a bill that will help our farm families. But it is also a bill that we know from the percentage breakdown is about nutrition and conservation and so much else. So we are grateful for all of the work that went into this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am thinking today about not only this legislation. I want to spend a few moments talking about our veterans. But also we had an opportunity today at lunch to listen to three individuals whose stories, among others, are portrayed in a book about the Freedom Riders in the early 1960s and the impact they had on civil rights, and the courageous witness they provided is an understatement. People literally risked their lives for freedom in the South.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I think about our veterans today, the GI bill that Senator Webb brought to this body, and so many of us cosponsored, when I think about the GI bill, the work today on agriculture and nutrition, and also the witness provided by these speakers today at lunch who were Freedom Riders, I am, of course, thinking about Senator Kennedy who is not with us today. He is outside of Washington and we are anxiously awaiting his return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I was thinking, as we all are today, about him and  about his health but also his presence here. Everything we did today virtually he has had an impact on for more than a generation, whether it was nutrition or whether it was helping our veterans or whether it was having the courage to stand up for civil rights. So we are thinking of him today.</paragraph>
