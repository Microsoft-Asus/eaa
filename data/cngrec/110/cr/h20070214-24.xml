  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, journalism has taken a plunge into the depth of disturbing depravity at Central Connecticut University. A writer for the college newspaper wrote a slam piece against sexual assault victims. His article was entitled, "Rape Only Hurts if You Fight It." He claims rape is a magical experience and a blessing for unattractive women. He and his Third-World college newspaper now say the piece was satire and humor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This mean-spirited article shows no humor, but vile and vicious and abusive words about women. Journalistic attacks on rape victims dehumanize them and show a total lack of understanding of this crime. Rape is a physical and emotional crime that tries to destroy the inner soul of the victim.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Almost one-fourth of the women on college campuses are rape victims. Journalists who are out of touch with the real world do a disservice to this field, and tragically, like physical abusers, heap journalistic abuse on rape victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
