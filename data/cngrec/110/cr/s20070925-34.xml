    <paragraph>Mr. President, King David sang:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in unity!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it comes to work here in Congress, the Children's Health Insurance Program has been as close to that ideal as a major piece of legislation can be. It began 10 years ago, with Senators working together across the political spectrum: Senators ORRIN HATCH and TED KENNEDY; Senators JOHN CHAFEE and JAY ROCKEFELLER. I was proud to have been part of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It passed overwhelmingly 10 years ago, and the President signed it into law. It worked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Children's Health Insurance Program brought people together across political divides because CHIP was, and always has been, about helping kids. CHIP has been about helping young Americans who, through no fault of their own, live in working families who cannot afford expensive private health insurance. It is about kids. It is about health. It is about low-income kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHIP is about kids going to the doctor. It is about kids having checkups. It is about kids getting vaccinations. It is about kids seeing the dentist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Healthy children are more likely to go to school. They are more likely to do well in school. They are more likely to get a good job after school. They are less likely to end up on welfare. They are more likely to become a productive member of the workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Children's Health Insurance Program has been a success. Since 1997, the share of all American children without health insurance dropped by a fifth, while the number of uninsured adult Americans increased. For our country's poorest children, the uninsured rate has dropped by a third.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Governors from both parties support the Children's Health Insurance Program. Two Presidents of different parties have supported and expanded CHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, we worked together to improve and extend the program. Senators ORRIN HATCH and JAY ROCKEFELLER, CHUCK GRASSLEY and I worked very closely together, with many meetings, working as hard as we could, focusing on kids. We cooperated in the finest tradition. I thank my colleagues for the hundreds of hours they put into that effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some told me: Put CHIP in reconciliation. That is the fast-track process we use sometimes around here. Some said: Use the fast-track budget process to pass CHIP, so you do not have to get big majorities to get things done. You do not have to worry about 60 votes. But I said: No. CHIP has always been a consensus bill. We would make CHIP a consensus bill again this year. It has in the past. It should always be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what we did. The Finance Committee reported the CHIP bill out by a vote of 17 to 4, strongly bipartisan. The Senate passed it by a vote of 68 to 31. This evening, the House of Representatives will pass essentially the same CHIP bill we passed in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now it is time for us to pass this bill and send it to the President. When we do, it will be time for the President to show he is also a uniter, he is not a divider but a uniter. It will be a time for the President to act in the best traditions of compassionate conservatism. It will be a time for the President to sign this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us show how good and pleasant it can be for Washington to work together in unity. That is what our people want. That is what the people who sent us here want. They want us working together. They do not like big fights, so long as we are doing what they regard is basically, essentially the right thing. This is that, clearly. So let us help get health care to kids who need it, and let us enact this CHIP bill into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
