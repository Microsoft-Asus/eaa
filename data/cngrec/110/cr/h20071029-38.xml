    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today, with great sympathy, in honor of the memory of Sergeant Edward Philpot of South Carolina National Guard's 218th Brigade Combat Team. Sergeant Philpot and his fellow soldiers were traveling as a convoy near Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan, last Tuesday when his Humvee accidentally went off the road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Philpot is the first member of the 218th, my former National Guard Brigade, to lose his life while serving in Afghanistan. His sacrifice is a reminder of the courage and dedication to duty shared by so many of our fellow Americans. We must never forget the immense sacrifices these brave men and women are making to defend freedom and to protect American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My thoughts and prayers are with Sergeant Philpot's wife, Stephanie; their three daughters; his parents, Ottas and Willa; and his entire family, friends, and fellow soldiers who continue to defend our country overseas. His sacrifice is a testament to the love for his country, his family, and his fellow soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
