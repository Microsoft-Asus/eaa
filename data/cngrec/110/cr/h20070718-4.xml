    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it's my pleasure to welcome Reverend Martin Lavengood and to thank him for the prayer he just delivered, and to welcome his family and many residents of the Evangelical Manor who are here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Lavengood has a long and honorable history of service to the community. Prior to being ordained in 1991, Reverend Lavengood taught high school English in New York. Shortly after his ordination, he studied in Jerusalem as the first Roberta Rudin Scholar for Jewish-Christian Studies. After his experience in Israel, the reverend returned to the United States and became active in prison ministry while serving in parishes in New York and Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, Reverend Lavengood moved to Philadelphia where he became a chaplain at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. While working there, he developed an interest in ministering to people of all ages, especially the elderly. This interest led him to his current position as chaplain of the Wesley Enhanced Living at Evangelical Manor in Philadelphia, where he's honored, he says, to serve members of the World War II generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Reverend Lavengood for his service to seniors and for taking time to come to Washington and offering this prayer before the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
