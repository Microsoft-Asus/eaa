    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today is judgment day. A quiet voice is crying from the grave for justice; it is the voice of a 9-year-old girl named Jessica Lunsford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jessica was kidnapped in the middle of the night from her home by a professional child molester; his name is John Couey. The criminal abused Jessica for several days and then buried her alive in his backyard. When found, Jessica had poked her tiny fingers through the plastic bag seeking air. Last week, a jury convicted the child killer of capital murder and the punishment hearing begins today in Florida. The State is seeking the death penalty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, evil doesn't get much worse than stealing, abusing and murdering little girls. Society cannot allow this type of conduct to occur. Society can only eliminate it. The punishment assessed on this criminal will set a price for this dastardly act. Hopefully the good people of Florida will, by their verdict, say to all child killers, leave our children alone or face an early meeting with your maker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
