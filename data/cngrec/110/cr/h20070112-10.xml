  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I once operated on a Vietnam veteran who then needed lifesaving drugs. But the VA program was going to make him wait for 2 weeks. He had no choice but to pay out of pocket hundreds of dollars. This is completely unacceptable. And we certainly do not want the same thing for our seniors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support seniors and vote "no" on <bill type="h" number="4">H.R. 4</bill> because this legislation prevents patients from getting the medication they need. When you scratch the surface, it becomes very clear that this legislation will lead to price controls and rationing. Furthermore, the idea of government negotiation is a joke.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this limits seniors' choices, it's not going to reduce cost, and once again it's the heavy hand of government telling people what is best for them. So I urge my colleagues to support seniors and vote "no" on this legislation.</paragraph>
