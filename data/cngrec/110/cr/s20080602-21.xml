    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Mr. Stephen Terry  on his retirement from the Oklahoma City Veterans Administration Medical Center. Mr. Terry retired as of June 2, 2008, after serving the Veterans Administration for 42 years. He has been the main individual within the Veterans Administration that my office has contacted over the past 14 years I have served in the U.S. Senate. Mr. Terry has consistently helped me better serve  Oklahoma veterans and their families. Mr. Terry has recently been awarded the Unsung Heroes Award by the Veterans Administration which is only awarded to those demonstrating outstanding public service which is characteristic of the time and attention Mr. Terry has provided to my constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only has Mr. Terry given so many years to the Veterans Administration, he has also served his country in the U.S. Navy from March 1967 though December 1970 as a Corpsman HM3 for the Marines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Stephen Terry has ably served his country throughout his entire career both in the military and in his public service. I appreciate that service and congratulate him on his well deserved retirement.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
