    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to congratulate the dance teams at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and the University of Memphis, who each won their second consecutive Division I-A national title at the Universal Dance Association College Nationals in January.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each team worked relentlessly over the holiday break in order to defend their 2007 national titles, practicing up to three times a day--and the hard work certainly paid off. The University of Tennessee squad was ranked first in the Jazz division after the semifinal round, while the University of Memphis squad topped the hip-hop division. Both teams continued their flawless performances in the final round, captivating the audience and comfortably securing their spots on top.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Tennessee Spirit Program is the only Division I-A program in the country to place in the top three in the dance, cheerleading and mascot divisions. In addition to their national title, the Tennessee dancers placed fifth in the hip-hop division. The Tennessee mascot, Smokey, also clinched a national title, his first since 2001. The Volunteer Cheer Squad placed second.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Memphis Spirit program had a strong showing as well. The Memphis dancers took home seventh place in the Jazz division while the Tigers' All-Girl squad took home a Division I national title, and the Co-Ed Squad placed fourth in Division I-A.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to congratulate Tennessee head coach Kelley Eidenmuller and Memphis coaches Carol Lloyd and Frankie Conklin for their outstanding work with these groups of dancers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an honor to represent the great State of Tennessee and these extremely talented and dedicated young people. I extend my heartfelt congratulations to these athletes for their tremendous accomplishments.</paragraph>
