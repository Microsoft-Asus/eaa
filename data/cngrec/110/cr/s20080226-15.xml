  <speaking speaker="300067" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak against the measure introduced by Senator Feingold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been only a year since GEN David Petraeus arrived in Baghdad and took command of American forces in Iraq. But in these brief 12 months, he and the American and coalition troops under his command have brought about a tectonic shif t in Iraq that has altered the course of the war there and, with it, the future of at least two great nations--Iraq and the United States of America--and the lives of hundreds of millions of people in those two nations and so many others threatened by violent</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the surge first began a year ago, many doubted that the violence then raging in Iraq could be brought under control. Even as American troops began implementing this bold new counterinsurgenc y strategy, some opponents of the war inside and outside of Congress declared that the war in Iraq was already "lost," that the surge had already been "tried and failed," and that it mattered more, frankly, that we get out of Iraq than that we succeed in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They could not have been more wrong. Thanks to the surge, the bravery and skill of American and Iraqi troops and the will of the Iraqi people to be free from terrorists, conditions on the ground in Iraq have been totally transformed from those</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A year ago, al-Qaida in Iraq was entrenched, in control of, exercising murderous control in Anbar Province and Baghdad. Now those evil forces of Islamist extremism are facing their single greatest and most humiliating defeat since 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not just my opinion. It is a matter of fact. In Baghdad, a fact: sectarian killings are down 95 percent in the last year; suicide bombings are down nearly 70 percent; IED attacks have been cut nearly in half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the face of those extraordi nary improvements in Iraq--and many more I will speak of in a moment in the social and political and economic life of that great country--however, antiwar forces here in America have reacted not with sighs of relief and gratitude but, instead, by doing everything in their power to downplay or diminish our hard-won gains in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than admit the possibility that they had been wrong about the surge and about the capability of reestablishing security in Iraq, they, instead, reached for another rational e for retreat. What they argued was the lack of political progress in Iraq and, therefore, that the surge had failed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this argument has also now been defeated by facts on the ground in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the first place, the Iraqi people have taken over their local and provincial governments in a grassroots up democratic revolution. At the national level, a response is occurring. It took too long, but it is now significant. Benchmark legislation has surged forward in the Iraqi Parliament. The budget law,  passed; the debaathification law, passed; the provincial powers and election law, passed; the amnesty law, passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to the surge, the Sunni Arabs, who once constituted the core of the insurgency, have now risen, because we stood by them, to join with us  and go ahead on their own to fight against al-Qaida and put al-Qaida--the same al-Qaida that attacked us on 9-11-01--on the run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to the surge, the Shiites, who had turned in desperation to militias and death squads for protectio n from al-Qaida and Iranian-backed extremists, are now rejecting those militias, death squads, and extremists. They want a better, more peaceful life for themselves and their families. And the American-led surge has put that within their reach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, Moqtada al-Sadr announced he is extending his unilateral cease-fire. He did not do this as a favor to the United States of America or the Maliki Government in Baghdad. He did it because in Iraq today, thanks to the surge, and all that has been part of  it, the rules of the game have changed. Violence and extremism are no longer the clear path to power in Iraq. In fact, they are becoming the path to political oblivion in Iraq. The people of Iraq want peace and stability and hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What then has been the reaction of antiwar groups here at home to these enormous achievements in Iraq? Are they  now ready to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To judge by the resolution now before us, the answer to that question is no. On the contrary, even as the facts on the ground have changed so much for the better,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some claim the war in Iraq is a distraction from the "real" war on terror. Al-Qaida disagrees. And so do I. Al-Qaida's leadership has repeatedly made  clear they consider Iraq to be the central front of their campaign against us and most of the rest of the civilized world. According to our intelligence agencies, al-Qaida in Iraq remains al-Qaida's most visible and capable affiliate worldwide and the only one known to have expressed a desire to attack the American homeland--us here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know there are some who hear these arguments, watch what is happening, and say: Oh, no. The sponsors of this legislation certainly understand exactly how much poli tical and military progress we are making against al-Qaida and Iranian-backed extremists in Iraq and how much is riding on the line there for America and most of the rest of the civilized world faced by this threat of violent jihadist terrorism. But this argument goes that the sponsors of this kind of resolution feel compelled to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I refuse to believe that. I refuse to believe--I do not believe it--that my colleagues wou ld so trifle with the honor of American soldiers who have served and are serving in Iraq--too many of whom have given their lives in that service--or they would play such a political game with our national security. I respect my colleagues too much to take this legislation as anything other than what it says. It orders a retreat within 120 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It actually imposes so-called caveats on American forces after that 120 days, which are exactly the kind of caveats, limitations, on what they can do that we are  now arguing with our European allies to stop in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, some of our NATO allies are there, but they can only do certain things. They cannot enter into battle, et cetera. They cannot go out into the field with the Afghani National Army. We are saying you cannot fight a war that way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Listen to what one section of this matter before us offered by the Senator from Wisconsin says. Our troops, after the 120 days, can provide training to members of the Iraqi Security Forces "provided that</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a caveat, a limitation, exactly what we are arguing with our European allies to stop doing in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, the legislation, this measure now before this Chamber, flies in the face of the recommendations of our proud and tested commanders on the ground in Iraq. If enacted, it would unravel all the hard-won gains our troops have made in  the past year. It would hand victory to the suicide bombers and fanatics who are now on the run. It would betray the millions of Iraqis who are standing with us today because they desire a better, freer life for themselves and their children. And it would</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to cl ose, if I may, with a word directed to my colleagues on this side of the aisle, the Democratic Members of this Senate. I have thought a lot about this war, and I cannot help but wonder, in a moment such as this, what some of the political heroes of my youth, who were Democrats, would think if they were here and could see and listen to this debate and read this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think of President Kennedy, who declared:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my opinion, that is exactly what we are doing in Iraq today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues: Do these words have meaning, have significance or are these just words?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think of President Harry Truman, who proclaimed, at the outset of the Cold War:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities o r by outside pressures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Are these too just words? Isn't that exactly what is happening in Iraq today? The people of Iraq, liberated from the terrible dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, hoping to secure a better future for themselves, now, with our assistance and encouragement, "are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities"--read here: al-Qaida--"or by outside pressures"--read here: Iran. Are these just words? I hope not. I do not believe they are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was a time when these were not ju st words, but they were the convictions that lay at the heart of the Democratic Party's foreign and national security policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation now before this Chamber, if implemented, would not, in my opinion, only betray our friends in the Middle East, it would not only betray America's own vital national interests against our deadliest enemies, al-Qaida and Iran, it would also betray the best ideals of the Democratic Party that I joined decades ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They were strong and liberal ideals, and I use th ose words intentionally. Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, and Kennedy, great Democratic Senators such as Hubert Humphrey and "Scoop" Jackson, believed that the party stood for being liberal at home and liberal abroad. What did that mean? Liberal in the classic sense of the term "freedom," which is what America is all about: the self-evident truth that we are all endowed by our Creator with the rights to life and liberty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I wish to appeal particularly today to my Democratic colleagues in the Senate t o reject this resolution, and in that sense to return to what I believe are the strongest, proudest, most purposed moments of the history of the Democratic Party in recent decades on matters of foreign and national security policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In sum, a year ago, the Bush administration acknowledged its mistakes in Iraq and changed course there. It is now time for opponents of the war and the surge to do the same. It is time for them to admit that the surge has worked and that America's security and freedom are on  the line in Iraq today, that we are winning there, and it would be a disastrous mistake to impose the policies ordered by this resolution, this amendment, which would deprive our brave American men and women in uniform and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I implore my colleagues, vote against this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair and I y ield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Oklahoma.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me, first of all, commend our colleague who just spoke. Senator Lieberman is very knowledgeable. It has been such an honor for me, in the years I have been in the Senate, to be serving on both the Armed Services Committee with him as well as the Environment and Public Works Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I very much am opposed to Senator Feingold's bills. But I wonder, i n this short session, in the short time we have left--we have such things to debate: the budget, housing, energy, consumer product safety, education, farm programs--and I have to ask: Why are we wasting valuable time on these bills? And why at this time do we need another report?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Security Strategy was written in 2006, and another will be required 150 days after the new administration comes in. The National Military Strategy review has been completed, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is co nducting his own additional review. The Quadrennial Defense Review will be out later this year. And the National Defense Strategy is also mandated by law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We currently have the strategy in place to win the global war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The study prescribed by <bill type="s" number="2634">S. 2634</bill> ties the hands of our military by telling them to outline a strategy that does not let them ut ilize the full extent of their resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the substance of Senator Feingold's bills has been debated and defeated. On December 18, 2007, we voted against an amendment of the same nature as <bill type="s" number="2633">S. 2633</bill> from the very same Senator, Senator Feingold. It was a troop withdrawal amendment, it was No. 3875, and it was defeated 71 to 24. We have already done this. Senator McCain said it best when he said that a majority had, by December 18, engaged in no less than 40 legislative attempts t o achieve the misguided</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We did away with the oppressive regime of Saddam Hussein, where mass graves, torture, and rape were normal and everyday occurrences. We did away with terrorist training camps in Samarra, Ramadi, Sargat, Salmon Pak--and incidentally, Salmon Pak, in that training camp, they had a fuselage of an old 707 there,  teaching people how to hijack airplanes. I guess we will never know whether the perpetrators of 9/11 were trained there. But nonetheless, there were four training camps there. They are gone</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We helped the Iraqi people create a free and Democratic country, where representation and the rule of law are replacing coercion and terror. The Iraqi Parliament has passed legislation that has reformed the de-Ba'athification, enacted pension reform that allowed former Ba'athists to collect thei r pensions. They enacted a law defining the provincial and central government roles and responsibilities. They passed the 2008 budget--faster than we are doing it, actually--and enacted an amnesty law</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have done the right thing, and we are winning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is interesting. A lot of the people who were the defeatists come back now--Katie Couric is an example--who says we are actually win ning. Less than half the al-Qaida leaders who were in Baghdad when the surge began are still in the city. They have either fled or were killed and captured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the list Senator Lieberman talked about and in terms of the successes, there has been a 75-percent reduction in religious and ethnic killings in the capital, they have doubled the seizure of insurgents' weapons caches, there has been a rise in the number of al-Qaida killed and captured, they have knocked out six media cells, maki ng it harder for al-Qaida to spread their propaganda, and Anbar incidents of attacks are down from 40 a day to less than 10 a day. There has</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been over there and we have seen it. You didn't used to be able to do that. The Iraqi Army is performing well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Iraqi citizens formed a grassroots movement called Concerned Citizens Leagues. This is interesting because this is allowing citizens, as we have in Washington, DC, and in  Tulsa, OK--we have groups that go out there to protect ourselves, and that is what these people are doing. They are unarmed. They are going out now with paint cans and drawing circles around undetonated IEDs and unexploded ordnance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>COL Tom James, one of the commanders of the 3rd I.D. in Iraq, said last Friday, February 22:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current security situation is stable and I am optimistic about the future. Sunni extremists are severely disrupted. They no longer find sanctuary an d support from the population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are winning because we are supporting our war fighters with a fundamental advantage, allowing them to command and control their forces--not doing it from here. Senator Feingold's amendment serves to tie the hands of our commanders on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2633">S. 2633</bill> legislates defeat. There is no other way to put it. The amendment legislates defeat. Secretary Gates said: If we were to withdraw, leaving Iraq in chaos, al-Qaida most certainly would use Anbar Province .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must remind Senator Feingold and the cosponsors of this amendment that al-Qaida is not the only threat to America and to our ideals. Ahmadinejad said on August 28--this is very interesting. He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Soon we will see a huge power vacuum in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A power vacuum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said this expecting our defeatism--h e is talking about these resolutions--he said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, we are prepared to fill the gap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now here is Iran, a country which recently declared a doubling of its uranium enrichment program and has been testing ballistic missiles, talking about filling this gap, the void that would be created.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lack of a secure and stable Iraq means instability in the Middle East and a clear avenue for terror and oppression to spread, and already has spread, into Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have h ad occasion to be in what we refer to as the CENTCOM and now AFRICOM and EUCOM some 27 times since 9/11. A lot of that time is down in areas such as Djibouti and in the heart of Africa, where we have our forces down there, because with this squeeze taking place in the Middle East, there is a lot of the terrorist traffic going into Africa. As for <bill type="s" number="2634">S. 2634</bill>, as the one before it, it is a thinly veiled attempt to end the war in Iraq by legislating defeat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill proposes to micromanage military strategy by  forcing the administration to narrowly</paragraph>
    <paragraph>define the future movement and employment of military personnel. It attempts to define the type of missions the military can conduct and places constraints on the length of time the military can deploy. It falsely presumes our professional warriors would be better served by limiting their deployments rather than suppor ting their victory over the enemy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the way, all these people who now talk to me about the long deployments--and I agree the deployments are too long--I wonder where they were in the 1990s when we cut down the size of our military, when we brought the number of divisions down from 18 to 10. I can remember being on the floor saying this day was going to come and that some day we were going to say: Why did we cut back so far?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, COL Tom James, speaking about our recent successes, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It all goes back to this window of security being opened, and being able to exploit that window of opportunity through governance and economics and building the capacity of the Iraqi security forces. This has all been enabled because of the surge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Proposing specific deployment and dwell times would limit the flexibility  of our commanders to conduct operations in the field and infringe on the President's authority as Commander in Chief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is the same flexibility t hat allowed the Commander in Chief to surge forces and turn the tide in Iraq. I am one of those who personally observed the changes that took place in Iraq with the surge. It was about a year ago right now. I recall a report where our intelligence was actually attending all the weekly Friday mosque meetings, and at that time, my recollection is 85 percent of those messages given by the imams and the clerics were anti-American messages. That stopped in April,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think we have already voted on these. They have been voted down, and we don't need to waste any more time on it. I think common sense--when we sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee, as we did this morning, and we looked at the brilliant generals who were testifying before us, such as General Casey, these people spend a lifetime knowing what is going on and h ow to negotiate wars. We are winning. Things are good right now. I have often thought--I was honored in 1991 to be on the first</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are experiencing a victory, the surge is working, and I hope we will be able to dispose of, in a very quick way, these two bills authore d by Senator Feingold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
