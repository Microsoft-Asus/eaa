  <narrative>HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES -- (Senate - February 15, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1087">S1087</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, another 2 months have passed, and more American troops lost their lives overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is only right that we take time in the Senate to honor them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since last memorializing the names of our fallen troops on December 19, the Pentagon has announced the deaths of 79 troops. They lost their lives in Iraq and in Operation Enduring  Freedom, which includes Afghanistan. They will not be forgotten. Today I submit their names into the RECORD:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot forget these men and women and their sacrifice. These brave souls left behind parents and children, siblings, and friends. We want them to know the country pledges to preserve the memory of our lost soldiers, who paid the ultimate price, with the dignity they deserve.</paragraph>
