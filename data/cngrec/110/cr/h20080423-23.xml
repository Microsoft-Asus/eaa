    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues today to support <bill type="h" number="5613">H.R. 5613</bill>, the Medicaid Safety Net Act. There's a lot of misinformation about what this bill does. Here are the facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When CMS put forth regulations to cut Medicaid service to save money, Mr. Barton's and Mr. Dingell's leadership not only prevented its cuts, but we actually saved more money than the cuts did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can't keep doing business in Washington the same way. Cutting services to save money the easy way, but not always the right way. We cannot cut programs for seniors on fixed incomes, for disabled children, for the medically needy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without this bill, North Carolina loses $2.5 billion, Missouri $1.4 billion, Florida $665 million. But with this bill we provide health care and cut waste, fraud and abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage the President to look past the rhetoric, withdraw his veto threat and encourage my colleagues to support this bill and support families in need.</paragraph>
