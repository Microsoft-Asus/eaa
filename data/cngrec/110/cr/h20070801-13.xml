    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, one reason America has remained free of attack for the last 7 years is because we have given the tools necessary to those on the front lines, whether it be our military or our intelligence officers. Many tactics to defend and protect this country have been used, one being electronic surveillance to gather foreign intelligence through the FISA Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, FISA was first implemented to assist the gathering of information during another era, well before the invention of cell phones, satellite tracking, or even the Internet. Terrorist groups and, more specifically, al Qaeda, have adapted to modern technology, and it's time the U.S. did the same. We're not talking about skirting the legal process but, rather, giving our intelligence officers the ability to gather information coming from foreign and/or known terrorists in the United  States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the majority to fix this problem now and help keep our country safe.</paragraph>
