  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I just want to take this 1-minute opportunity to address comments through the Speaker to my friends in the Democratic Party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are being asked to vote on a continuing resolution tomorrow, $463 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as I understand it, the Democrats didn't have any input. Basically, just the very top had input on how this would be spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would implore every Democrat of conscience, Madam Speaker, to talk to your leadership. This isn't right. You talked about being open and fair, sunlight. This isn't it. Good government means at least you should have some input, even though we are not having any. Talk to your leadership. Let's get some openness, some sunlight into the process for the good of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I implore every Member of conscience to speak up.</paragraph>
