    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning, as indicated, we are going to have a change of schedule, but it will work out just fine. I have spoken with the distinguished Republican leader. We are going to do what we can to finish this bill today. It is extremely important. It will give the House and Senate 2 full days prior to the recess to have this important bill worked on in regard to the conference that must take place. Hopefully, the first day or two that we get back after the break, we can have  a conference report to vote on. I hope we can do that. That would be extremely important if we could.</paragraph>
