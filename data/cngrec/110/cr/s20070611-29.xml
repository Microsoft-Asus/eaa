  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Honorable Jeffrey S. Merrifield will be leaving the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC, on June 30, 2007. Originally from Antrim, NH, Jeff Merrifield has served as a member of the Commission since October 23, 1998. First appointed by President Clinton, Jeff was reappointed by President Bush and was sworn in for a second term on August 5, 2002. After a distinguished government career at the NRC and on Capitol Hill, Jeff Merrifield has chosen to pursue endeavors  in the private sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his tenure at the NRC, Jeff Merrifield has invested considerable time in familiarizing himself with the operations of NRC licensees, visiting all 104 operating power reactors in the United States, as well as numerous nuclear materials facilities and sites undergoing decommissioning. Jeff actively supported initiatives to improve the transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness of NRC regulatory programs. He headed an NRC Communications Task Force charged with initiating and implementing  many recommendations to improve agency internal and external communications. Jeff also led an interagency task force of fifteen departments and agencies to identify gaps in the control and use of radiation source materials as required by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Recommendations of this task force were detailed in a report to the President and Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jeff Merrifield has advocated a vision of excellence in regulating the safe and secure uses of nuclear material for the public good. A participant in the development of NRC's Strategic Plan, he championed a number of significant regulatory improvements, including efforts to risk-inform regulations, provide discipline in staff review of applications for license renewal, and prepare the agency for potential new power reactor applications. Recently Jeff chaired a Combined License Review Task Force  which made a number of recommendations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the review of new reactor applications. He was the leading advocate for the use of the alternate dispute resolution process in agency enforcement actions and has taken a special interest in improving the management of decommissioning funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an NRC Commissioner, Jeff Merrifield was actively involved in the agency's post September 11, 2001, response activities. These actions resulted in a significant improvement in security at NRC licensed facilities. Both before and since the terrible events of 9/11, NRC licensed power reactors are some of the best protected facilities in the civilian community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recognizing the NRC's influence in the international regulatory community, Jeff has traveled abroad to discuss policy issues with nuclear regulators and foreign dignitaries in more than 35 countries and has toured more than 140 nuclear reactors overseas. In 2005, he led an NRC delegation to India for the fifth bilateral exchange between the Indian Atomic Energy Regulatory Board and the NRC. This was the first visit to India by a member of the Commission following President Bush's initiative "Next  Steps in the Strategic Partnership" with India. Jeff was also the major advocate for the establishment of a three-nation agreement with Canada and Mexico on nuclear materials and waste issues through periodic trilateral meetings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, please join me in thanking Jeff Merrifield for his dedicated service to the American people and in wishing him and his family all the best in their future pursuits.</paragraph>
