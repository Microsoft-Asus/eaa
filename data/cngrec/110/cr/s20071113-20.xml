  <narrative>FISCAL POLICY -- (Senate - November 13, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14246">S14246</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me describe a couple of things that represent front-page news these days. Regrettably, I believe, these things threaten the potential future prosperity of our country and require an urgent response on the part of the President and the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The economy and fiscal policy of this administration--and the lack of regulatory interest on the part of this administration--has led us to an abyss that is very troublesome. We see the dollar dropping in value to other currencies. We see a dramatic trade deficit of $2 billion a day, that we are buying from other countries more than we are selling to other countries. We see a fiscal policy budget deficit that the President says is coming down. The only way he can say the deficit is significantly  coming down is that he is taking all of the surplus Social Security revenues that are supposed to go into the Social Security trust fund and using every dollar of that surplus as an offset against other revenue and other spending in order to show a much lower deficit. We are far off track</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not conservatism. We have a responsibility to begin paying for these costs. We send soldiers to war and the President says to the American people: You go shopping and do your part for the American economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That should not happen. What should happen is when we send soldiers to go to war and ask them to wear the uniform of their country and go in harm's way, we should, as a responsible Congress and President, pay for the costs as we go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't understand it. The President is down there at the White House saying $22 billion additional for the kinds of things that invest in our country--he says I am opposed to that. He said I will veto 10 of your bills, if necessary. He said, I am opposed to that $22 billion of your bills, half of which is invested in health care. Then he says, by the way, I want $196 billion on the other side, none of it paid for, for my priorities, and he says: But that is for the troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sorry, it is not just for the troops. A substantial portion of that is for the contractors. There is dramatic  evidence of the greatest waste, fraud, and abuse in the history of this country going to contractors who are profiteering, regrettably, during a war. For a long while I have believed--we have had votes in the Senate and all on the other side of the aisle have voted against it--that we should have a Truman-type committee, such as the one  Harry Truman led many decades ago, that began to investigate the waste, fraud, and abuse in contracting that is existing, that is fleecing the American taxpayer, undermining the American troops, going on under the nose of this administration, and nobody seems to care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to a fiscal policy that is out of control, let me describe the second portion of that, and that is an administration that doesn't want regulators to regulate. I understand some do not like regulation, but this administration has gone way beyond the pale in saying to regulators, look the other way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what is happening. This morning you read the newspaper and see that subprime loans are beginning to have a big impact on all Americans because it is beginning to have an impact on the economy. What does all this mean, subprime lending?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me describe it to you. Again, the regulators were asleep, didn't do anything, didn't care very much. Here is what has been going on. We have had mortgage companies that used to be kind of the slow, little companies that would lend you money for your home, down on the street corner someplace, not much going on, somebody who was a thoughtful person with a pencil above their ear, they were wearing a white shirt and suspenders. You would sit down and say, I need a home loan. They would be glad  to help you and they would sit down and work out a home loan for you. That was the way home loans worked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of a sudden, home loans have changed. All of a sudden it is a go-go industry. This is what they started doing. It is unbelievable. This is an advertisement from the biggest home lending company in this country: Homeowners, do you want to refinance and get cash? Countrywide has a great reason to do it now. A no cost finance. It has no points, no applications fee, no credit reporting and no third party fees. No title, no escrow, or appraisal fees. Absolutely no closing costs. So you wind up  with a lot more cash.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is another company that had a different thing to say, Zoom Credit:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Credit approval is just seconds away. Get on the fast track at Zoom Credit. At the speed of light, Zoom Credit will pre-approve you for a car loan, a home loan or a credit card. Even if your credit's in the tank. Zoom Credit's like money in the bank. Zoom Credit specializes in credit repair and debt consolidation, too. Bankruptcy, slow credit, no credit--who cares?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an ad from a mortgage company.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Millenia Mortgage had to say in their advertisement:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twelve months No Mortgage Payment. That's right. We will give you the money to make your first 12 payments if you call in the next 7 days. We pay it for you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me describe what all this means and what they were doing. I will do it with respect to the largest mortgage lending company. Angelo Mozilo created Countrywide Finance, the biggest mortgage company in our country. They are the ones, along with others, who helped create the riskier loans and in many cases targeted those loans to those who could not repay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do you have less than perfect credit? Late mortgage payments? Denied by other lenders? Call us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was one of Countrywide's advertisements. Let me say again:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late mortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? Call us--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Countrywide says.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So they began to attract borrowers through advertising, and then they had brokers on the phone soliciting, calling somebody up, saying: Let's talk about a new mortgage. We can get some cash for you and reduce your interest rates. So they created "affordability loans," a new category; then adjustable rate mortgages; then interest-rate-only loans; then reduced documentation or no-documentation loans. When I heard that one, I thought, What does that mean? It means just what it says: If you want  to get a loan, a home mortgage, and you don't want to document your income, they say that is fine, we will give you a no-doc loan. You will pay a little higher interest rate, but we will certainly give you a mortgage if you don't have documentation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the new mortgages they began to offer is interest-only loans so the borrower is required to pay interest charges only. They deferred any principal payment to much later; and then they came up with a pay option adjustable rate mortgage, which  allowed the borrower to pay only a portion of the interest, none of the principal, just a portion of the interest, and defer all of it to the end of the loan. This means you might end up paying much more for the house than the house is worth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All these fancy things--what they were saying to potential borrowers was, if you have bad credit, come to us because we have an instrument for you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is about greed, by the way, because the brokers and the banks made extraordinary amount of money. So what they did was they created a circumstance where they would loan to people something called subprime loans. There is evidence they put people into subprime loans, even though they could have qualified for prime loans. Why? Because subprime loans paid more. Then they rolled these subprime loans, in many cases for people who couldn't repay, and they would set the interest rate ridiculously  low--pay 2 percent interest rate, for example, and then it will reset in 24 months, 36 months, and when it resets, it will reset way up here, but in the meantime here is your monthly payment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They were quoting monthly payments without the escrow, so they were recording ridiculously low payments. In some cases, they were quoting interest only loans, some cases with only partial interest, in other cases at ridiculously low rates that were going to reset at a high rate, and then they would attach prepayment penalties to them so they could lock people in. And then what they did is they rolled this up like sausage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was a story about how there used to be sawdust in with meat when they rolled sausage up so you didn't know what you were eating. It was good filler, apparently. They rolled these up as securities with the subprime loans, the prime loans, rolled them up as a security, sliced them up to be sold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Guess what. The big investors out there liked this stuff. It paid pretty high rates at this point because you were able to have prepayment penalties and a whole series of things. They are buying these things without having the foggiest idea what is in them. The rating agencies are rating them as OK. So you have the folks investing in the securities that represent these subprimes. Then all of a sudden it is discovered people are not able to pay. They can't make their house payments. The interest  rate gets reset. It is way up. They don't have a ghost of a chance of making the house payment, and then they stand around scratching their head wondering what happened. I will tell you what happened, a carnival of greed on the part of the mortgage brokers, bank security firms--all of them, a total carnival of greed. Now they are all walking around scratching their head, trying to figure out what do we do next.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, Merrill Lynch, for example, lost $8.4 billion, I guess it was, 2 weeks ago, so they fired their CEO. I believe he got $161 million in securities and retirement benefits--as he went out the door.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week it was CitiGroup that fired their CEO. There was a pretty substantial benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is going on all over the country. By the way, the head of the company that is the largest company, Mr. Mozilo, in the midst of all this, head of the largest company that is engaged in all this, Countrywide, earned $142 million last year. He was celebrated as the executive--Fortune Magazine's prestigious Company of the Year. The Horatio Alger award. He made $142 million last year and the New York Times reports that he was selling $138 million of his stock in the company as he was talking  about how well the company was doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This subprime scandal is all about greed. It is not new. It happened in the savings and loan industry. It has happened in other areas. It is now happening with respect to this mortgage industry scandal. The administration, of course, doesn't want anybody looking over anybody's shoulder, so there  has been no regulation. You have hedge funds buying into these things. They are unregulated, by and large. There is no regulation, no oversight, Katy-bar-the-door,  do what you want to do, the private sector will be fine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not fine. This is having a significant and serious impact on this country's economy. I am going to come back to this in a moment, but let me describe the other issue that is happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We wake up this morning and oil is $90 to $100 a barrel. You ask why is that the case? Why is oil $90 to $100 a barrel? Once again, it is lack of oversight. Here we have a futures market on which oil is bought and sold. This futures market has now become an unbelievable orgy of speculation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was reading yesterday from an article, an analyst from the Oppenheimer Company in New York, was talking about the price of oil. He says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm absolutely convinced that oil prices shouldn't be a dime above $55 a barrel. Oil speculators include the largest financial institutions of the world. I call it the world's largest gambling hall. It is open 24-7. Unfortunately there are segments of the market that are unregulated. This is like a highway with no cops, no speed limit, and everybody is going 120 miles an hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is happening with oil? It is interesting, if you take a look at this unbelievable speculation that is going on in the futures market. You have industrial banks in this country, investment banks. They are actually buying tanks to store oil. This takes the oil off the market. They are doing this because they believe that the price of oil will be higher in the future. So they take oil off the market now, store it, and sell it later for a profit. This creates an upward pressure on price. You  now have hedge funds hip deep in the futures markets. They didn't used to be. It used to be that the futures market for oil had a relationship to the supply and demand with respect to oil. There were other tensions in various parts of the world that</paragraph>
    <paragraph>might affect it some, but not like we have seen recently. As is the case in most areas, this has gotten way out of hand. There is no way that current supply-and-demand relationships with oil justify $100 a barrel. It is a futures market that is propelled by unbelievable speculation in search of profits by a whole range of interests, especially now including hedge funds and investment banks and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question is, who are the victims of all of this? The victims are people, the people who drive up to the gas pump. The victims on the subprime market are the people who cannot repay a mortgage; and somebody says maybe they should have known better. Maybe so, but when a broker is going to make a $30,000 commission by writing a $1 million mortgage and selling over the phone 2 percent interest rates, I am telling you there are a whole lot of folks who get sucked into that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The point here is we face a situation in several areas where there is a total, complete lack of common sense. There is this little book written by Robert Fulghum a long while ago that would, in my judgment, provide some benefit to some people. The title of the book is, "All I Really Need To Know I Learned In Kindergarten." The lessons are not unusual. The lessons are: Play fair, don't hit, don't take what is not yours, wash your hands, flush--you know, the things I learned in kindergarten;  the things that are important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could write a primer on "All The Things I Really Need To Know I Learned In Kindergarten." We could write that primer and instantly people would say you can't have an oil futures market that is rampant in speculation with hedge funds and others now pushing up the price of oil having little to do with supply and demand. You can't have a mortgage industry in which the mortgage companies decide they are going to provide loans to people who cannot afford to repay the loan and make very big profits  and lock them in with a prepayment penalty. They are all fat and happy and making a massive amount of money. You can't have that without a significant consequence to our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What do I suggest? It is simple. Let's sober up a little bit on fiscal policy in this administration and this Congress. Maybe we can say to the President: You want $196 billion. OK. You tell us how you want to pay for it. Send us the recommendation, and we will certainly take a look at that. We want to do everything that needs to be done to support our troops. But a substantial portion is not going to support our troops. It is going to support big contractors that have been bilking the taxpayer  for a long time. We are going to take a hard look at that and investigate it and get to the bottom of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to get back on track in trade and fiscal policy. Ignoring it might feel good, but it is not the right thing for the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to the issue of subprime lending and futures markets, if that doesn't persuade Members of this body there needs to be some thoughtful, sensible regulation, then I don't know what will. I chaired the hearings on Enron. It was to my subcommittee that Ken Lay came on behalf of Enron, raised his hand, and took the fifth amendment. Mr. Lay is dead. Many of the folks who worked with him at Enron are in prison. But I understand what happened in that scandal. The American public, again,  was a victim. They got fleeced. In Enron's case, they were manipulating markets to drive up the cost of electricity on the west coast and bilk people out of billions of dollars. What did it mean? It meant we had to put in place some regulations to prevent that from happening again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What does it mean when people go up to the gas pump this afternoon and pay a substantial amount for a tank of gasoline at a time when the price of oil is running toward $100 a barrel and the futures market is driving that price up, having very little to do with supply and demand but more to do with an orgy of speculation? It means we ought to care about that. It means there ought to be some regulatory oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This administration has a lot to answer for, as does the Congress. I am pleased to be a part of the majority, and we are working hard to try to respond to and deal with these issues. But these issues are not going to go away. The prosperity of this country's future is at stake. We need to get it right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
