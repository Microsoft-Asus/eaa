  <narrative>Whereas the Purple Heart is the oldest military decoration in present use;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Purple Heart is awarded in the name of the President of the United States to members of the Armed Forces who are wounded in action against an enemy of the United States or are wounded while held as prisoners of war, and is awarded posthumously to the next of kin of members of the Armed Forces who are killed in action against an enemy of the United States or who die of wounds received in action against an enemy of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Purple Heart was established on August 7, 1782, during the Revolutionary War, when General George Washington issued an order establishing the Badge of Military Merit; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the award of the Purple Heart ceased with the end of the Revolutionary War, but was revived in 1932, the 200th anniversary of George Washington's birth, out of respect for his memory and military achievements; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas observing National Purple Heart Recognition Day is a fitting tribute to George Washington and to the more than 1.5 million recipients of the Purple Heart: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That Congress--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) supports the goals and ideals of "National Purple Heart Recognition Day";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) encourages all people in the United States to learn about the history of the Purple Heart and to honor its recipients; and</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of Senate Concurrent Resolution 27, which calls upon this Nation to take one day per year to honor those brave warriors whose tremendous dedication and self-sacrifice have earned them the Purple Heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As noted earlier today, the Purple Heart is awarded by a grateful Nation to those brave soldiers, marines, sailors and airmen who have been wounded in battle while protecting their fellow citizens from enemies of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Established in 1792 during the Revolutionary War as the Badge of Military Merit, this sacred metal was revived in 1932, 200 years after the birth of George Washington. To date, there have been over 1.5 million recipients of the Purple Heart. This number gives me pause. Over 1.5 million Americans have been wounded, injured, and some have even given their lives so that we might stand here today as the oldest democracy in the world. Their families have endured hardship; their children have had to  deal with fear and uncertainty that their brave and heroic father or mother may not return from keeping them safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot help but feel that we, as beneficiaries of this sacrifice, owe these brave men and women time to reflect on the price of our freedom. We should stand shoulder to shoulder with the military families of this great Nation to recognize our military going into harm's way, to pray for their safe return, and when that fateful moment comes, to honor the bravery and the courage of warriors who did not blink in the face of danger, but who sacrificed for the democratic ideals that we cherish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why a resolution supporting a national day to commemorate our brave men and women who have so valiantly earned the Purple Heart has been brought to the floor of Congress today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to take this moment to recognize our colleagues in the other body, the gentlewoman from New York, the honorable Mrs. Clinton, and the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Hagel) for their sponsorship of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution that calls upon all people in the United States to conduct appropriate ceremonies, activities and programs to demonstrate support, thanks and appreciation for the estimated 1.5 million very special members of the Armed Forces, past and present, who have been awarded the Purple Heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Purple Heart is awarded only for those who are killed or wounded in action against the United States of America. So it is fitting that we honor and recognize their sacrifices on National Purple Heart Recognition Day, as well as recall GEN George Washington's order 225 years ago on August 7, 1782, that established the Badge of Military Merit, the predecessor of the Purple Heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In 2001, in connection with the announcement of the creation of the National Purple Heart Hall of Honor, my former colleague, Ben Gilman, a New York Representative, a World War II veteran of the Army Air Corps, made the following statement. It is a statement that for me helps to put in context why we should make a special effort on National Purple Heart Recognition Day. Congressman Gilman said: "The Purple Heart is probably the most recognizable military award in the United States. Every school  child knows the medal is awarded to our brave American military who are wounded in the line of duty."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are to ensure that Americans, even down to every school child, continue to recognize the significance of the Purple Heart and the sacrifices of the men and women who earned it, then we must make the effort to commemorate and educate this and future generations. Support for this resolution is one way to begin that effort.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hall).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, National Purple Heart Recognition Day is August 7, 2007. This year, we celebrate the 225th anniversary of the Badge of Military Merit. This medal, the forerunner of the modern Purple Heart, was designed by GEN George Washington in his headquarters in Newburgh, New York, in the Hudson River Valley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The badge, given for "any singularly meritorious Action," was the "figure of a Heart in Purple Cloth or Silk edged with narrow Lace or Binding to be worn on the uniform coat above the left breast."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After falling into disuse after the Revolutionary War, GEN Douglas MacArthur had a new medal designed based on the Badge of Military Merit. This medal, the modern Purple Heart, was awarded for meritorious action or for receiving a wound in combat with the enemy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since that time, more than 1.5 million people have received the Purple Heart. These men and women sacrificed for our country. Many never came home. The Purple Heart recognizes their sacrifice and their service protecting the rights and liberties we enjoy at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National Purple Heart Recognition Day serves to remind the country of those who have suffered injury or death in the defense of our country. It is always right to remember and honor those who have sacrificed, and this resolution encourages Americans to learn more about the history of the Purple Heart and its recipients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, on National Purple Heart Recognition Day, recipients and their families will come together at the Purple Heart Hall of Honor in the town of New Windsor at the New Windsor Cantonment site in the Hudson River Valley of New York, in New York's 19th Congressional District, which I am proud to represent, and Orange County, a county which the aforementioned Congressman Gilman represented so ably. There, they will recognize the anniversary of the Badge of Military Merit, the 75th anniversary  of the Purple Heart, and, most importantly, the price that the recipients and their families have paid protecting our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask that the House pass this resolution to recognize those who will gather in New Windsor on August 7 to honor the sacrifices and suffering of Purple Heart recipients and their families and to remember those who paid the ultimate price and are no longer with us</paragraph>
