  <speaking speaker="400206" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I filed a bill to support our troops in harm's way, and I rise in support of them, and in support of this country and this Congress backing our brave men and women in uniform 100 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I fear what all the talk of Washington about pulling funding for our troops is going to do to the privates and sergeants stationed in Camp Blue Diamond, think about it, for the next 11 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are elected to protect our men and women in uniform, just as they protect our freedoms every day. Our guys are fighting for America. They are fighting for you and me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All this talk of doom and gloom hurts mission success and stifles troop morale. It is imperative our Nation backs our troops to the hilt. As long as we deploy men and women across the  globe, we will never, ever leave a member of our military in harm's way without support. That is our Congress's responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our troops are not the enemy. They deserve our full support, and that is why I hope folks will cosponsor my bill to support our troops in harm's way.</paragraph>
