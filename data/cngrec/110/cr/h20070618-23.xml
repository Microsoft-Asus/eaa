    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2127">H.R. 2127</bill>. This bill will designate the Chelsea, Oklahoma, post office as the Clem Rogers McSpadden United States Post Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am extremely proud to be the author of this bill. Today we have the opportunity to honor not just one of Oklahoma's finest individuals, but in any opinion one of America's finest. As many of you know, Clem McSpadden served as a Member of this body from 1973 until 1975. His colleagues will agree that Clem was a highly respected Member of this Chamber. In fact, Clem was honored with being the first freshman Member ever to be appointed to the Rules Committee. He also helped create  the Rural Caucus, which I am a proud member of today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those are big shoes to fill for anyone, and that is why it is an honor for me to say I represent a portion of his former congressional district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am also proud to mention that Clem isn't just known as being a former Member of Congress. As those of us from Oklahoma know, Clem has readily served in all aspects of life, ranging from politics to family to military service to rodeo announcer. If you asked people in Oklahoma about Clem, you will surely be met with warm stories about how he helped them during his time in the State Senate, how they remember him introducing legendary bull rider Freckles Brown, or how he just gave  them some good advice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Very few people, Mr. Speaker, would make such a great role model for us all. For this reason, I am proud to say I know Clem McSpadden and that he is a friend. More importantly, though, I am proud to say I am one of the many Oklahomans that he has had a positive influence on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Clem is the nephew of Oklahoma's favorite son, Will Rogers. In keeping with the family legacy, Clem, like his uncle, is fully a part of the fabric that makes Oklahomans the people we are today. We are a people who care about our fellow Oklahomans and who pay their dues through hard work. Clem represents these values on a daily basis and has done so his whole life. This, I venture to say, also makes him one of Oklahoma's favorite sons. For this reason, I find it fitting that we honor  an individual like Clem Rogers McSpadden for his selflessness and dedication to our State and country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in 1974 my father ran for Governor and Clem McSpadden ran for Governor the same year; and even though they were opponents in the election of 1974, they were friends after that election. I am also proud to say that when I was a member of the State legislature in my first term, Clem McSpadden took me aside and mentored me as a member of the legislature. He is a good man and I want to thank him for being a mentor to so many young people. I also want to thank his wife, Donna, for all  that she does in the community of Chelsea and the State of Oklahoma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="2127">H.R. 2127</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, to most residents of Rogers County, Oklahoma, and rodeo fanatics, the name Clem Rogers McSpadden is well recognized and much appreciated. Known as a "son of Oklahoma," Clem Rogers McSpadden was born into the well-known Rogers family of which his home county is named. His great uncle is none other than the famous Will Rogers. But it is not his historical family background that we are here to speak about today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We rise to honor the achievements of Clem McSpadden during his life in politics, his military service, community leadership, and successful career in rodeo broadcasting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clem McSpadden was raised on his two family ranches, Bushyhead Ranch near Chelsea, Oklahoma, and another in nearby Oologah. During his first year in Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College, he left to join the U.S. Navy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He served during World War II, and upon returning completed his education at Oklahoma A&amp;M with a degree in animal husbandry. While at college, he and some friends formed a rodeo team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His strong interest in roping began at an early age, and over time he served as general manager for the National Finals Rodeo, the Old Timers Rodeo and the Indian National Finals Rodeo. He has been announcing for over 60 years and estimates he has announced over 1,400 rodeos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His esteemed career in politics came in 1954 when he was elected to the Oklahoma State senate, where he served until 1972. He went on to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives one term in the 93rd Congress. In 1983, he formed a consulting and lobbying firm McSpadden &amp; Associates, which lobbies the Oklahoma Statehouse on a variety of issues. His powerful presence and influence continue to drive politics of his beloved Oklahoma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nowadays, he spends his time more quietly at home on his vast cattle ranch enjoying retirement with his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge Members to join me, Mr. Speaker, in passing <bill type="h" number="2127">H.R. 2127</bill> to name this post office for Clem Rogers McSpadden.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="2127">H.R. 2127</bill>, which names a postal facility in Chelsea, Oklahoma, after Clem Rogers McSpadden. <bill type="h" number="2127">H.R. 2127</bill>, which was introduced by the gentleman from Oklahoma, Dan Boren, on May 3, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on June 12, 2007, by a voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire Oklahoma congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clem Rogers McSpadden was born on November 9, 1925, on a ranch near the small town of Bushyhead in Rogers County, Oklahoma. He served in the United States Navy during World War II from 1944 to 1946.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was first elected to public office in November of 1954 to the Oklahoma State senate. In November of 1972, he was elected to the 93rd Congress and served one term from 1973 to 1975. Mr. McSpadden ran for Governor of Oklahoma in 1974 and lost the Democratic nomination. Presently, Mr. McSpadden is retired and living in Chelsea, Oklahoma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Dan Boren, for introducing this legislation and urge its swift passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412201" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have no other speakers, so I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, to simply close, let me again commend Dan Boren for his introduction of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I guess Representative McSpadden was kind of a chip off the block, and I asked if he could also make people laugh, and Dan said that he could indeed, as well as do any number of other things. So he is indeed a tribute to the Rogers and McSpadden families. I would urge passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="2127">H.R. 2127</bill>.</chair>
