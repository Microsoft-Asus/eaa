  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today, as a physician, a mother and a representative of many who would benefit from <bill type="h" number="3">H.R. 3</bill>, in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3">H.R. 3</bill> which would expand Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, increase stem cell lines and impose strict ethical guidelines. These stem cells would otherwise be destroyed. So this is not a faith issue, a theological conundrum or a partisan issue. It is a public health issue and one of maintaining this country's leadership in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is important to minorities and the Congressional Black Caucus because embryonic stem cell research will help reduce and even eliminate the health care disparities that now leave African Americans and other people of color more likely to be disabled or die from the diseases it can cure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a physician I have treated individuals with some of these diseases--Parkinson's, sickle cell, ALS and others--and despite using all we had available too often stood helplessly with their families as the conditions took their toll. Today we can change that and we must.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a mother and a grandmother of three, I ask my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="3">H.R. 3</bill> and create a healthier and better country for all of us.</paragraph>
