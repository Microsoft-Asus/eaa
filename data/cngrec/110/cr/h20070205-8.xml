  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Chicago Bears and the Indianapolis Colts were not the only teams hungry for victory last night. Reverend Brad Smith of the Spring Valley Presbyterian Church in Columbia, South Carolina, founded the Souper Bowl of Caring 16 years ago. This youth-led non-profit collects money on Super Bowl Sunday to feed the hungry in their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its beginning, the group has raised $33 million. Nearly 103,000 youth groups have participated, and more than 18,000 charity organizations nationwide have benefited from its work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The coordination of the Souper Bowl of Caring with the NFL Super Bowl has not gone unnoticed. Five NFL team owners, including two with South Carolina connections, have made significant financial contributions to fund the organization. Specifically, I would like to recognize USC graduate Bob McNair, and his wife, Columbia College graduate Janice McNair, with the Houston Texans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Souper Bowl of Caring is making a positive difference alleviating hunger, and all Americans appreciate its efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
