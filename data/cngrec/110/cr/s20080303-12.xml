  <speaking speaker="412248" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. I would like to say, just listening to our two leaders, there are certainly a lot of issues that our country needs to deal with. I would say that this body has lost a great deal of credibility as it relates to stimulus packages by virtue of the one we just passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I know there will be people throughout our country who will be gleefully receiving checks in this election year, which certainly will make them feel good about us for a week or two, I think most of them realize our previous attempts at stimulating the economy did more to stimulate the good will toward us than the economy. I think all of us should be very slow to try to move toward a stimulus package, in that our past efforts, to me, have lacked the kind of credibility necessary in these  difficult times.</paragraph>
