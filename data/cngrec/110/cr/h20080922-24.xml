  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="5335">H.R. 5335</bill>, introduced by our colleague from Tennessee, Representative Wamp, implements the recommendations of a National Park Service study that examined the possibility of adding several side trails associated with the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress designated the original National Historic Trail in 1987 to commemorate the two main routes used during the forced removal of more than 15,000 Cherokee Indians from their ancestral homelands in the southeastern United States. At that time, many of the side routes used during the removal were not well documented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Subsequent research has identified these routes, and in 2006 Congress directed the National Park Service to determine which, if any, of these routes would be eligible for addition to the existing trail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Park Service found a number of components eligible for designation and recommended adding routes in Tennessee and Alabama. <bill type="h" number="5335">H.R. 5335</bill> adds those routes to the existing trail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support passage of this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400440" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation, <bill type="h" number="5335">H.R. 5335</bill>, has been explained by the good manager of the bill, and we support the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to, at this time, acknowledge the bill's author, Congressman ZACH WAMP, and of course Congressman Shuler. Both of them have asked me and asked the leadership of the Resources Committee to move this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the legislation because it does recognize the angst of those that marched on this trail. I strongly compliment both of those gentlemen for their hard work.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412225" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for <bill type="h" number="5335">H.R. 5335</bill>, the Trail of Tears Documentation Act. As a co-sponsor of this legislation, I feel that it is imperative that Congress make it a priority to protect and preserve these historic routes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5335">H.R. 5335</bill> amends the National Trails System Act to provide for the inclusion of new trail segments, land components, and campsites associated with the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Trail of Tears was a significant and shameful chapter in American history. In 1838-1839, the U.S. Government forcibly removed Cherokee Indians from their ancestral homelands in western North Carolina and other parts of the southeastern United States and resettled them in Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Over 15,000 Cherokees were systematically rounded up from their homes and forced to travel by foot, horseback, boat, and wagon across the southern U.S. to Indian Territory.  More than 1,000 people died from exposure, illness, and exhaustion during the roundup and removal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to have grown up alongside the Qualla Boundary in western North Carolina, home to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. The EBCI are descended from the Cherokee who resisted removal by taking to their ancestral mountains, where they still live to this day and keep alive the traditions and values of their forefathers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Trail of Tears Act designated two primary travel routes, the northern land route and the water routes. This amendment specifically adds other significant routes that were used by the Cherokee during the resettlement. These include: the Bell and Benge routes, the land components of the water routes, the routes from the roundup forts and camps in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee, and the related campsites located along the routes and land components.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a proud co-sponsor of this bill, and I commend Congressman ZACH WAMP for introducing this legislation and fighting to ensure its passage in the 110th Congress. I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the memory of all of the Cherokee who suffered during the removal on the Trail of Tears.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400421" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Young and their staff for their help. I'd also like to thank all 21 cosponsors for their involvement and especially Congressman Heath Shuler, who helped me champion this very worthy initiative. Most of all, I would like to thank Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, Chad Smith and Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee, Michell Hicks, as well as the National and State Trail of Tears  Associations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud of <bill type="h" number="5335">H.R. 5335</bill>, the Trail of Tears Documentation Act and count it as a great privilege to be the lead sponsor. When I was a little boy, my mother told me of my own Cherokee heritage. Her grandfather, Luna Meadows was half Cherokee. His mother, Little Flower, was a full-blooded Cherokee midwife. So completing the story of the Cherokee Removal is personal for me and very important for our country as the Trail of Tears and the forced removal is one of the seminal injustices in American  history. It must be told accurately, honestly and completely. I urge passage of this bill and enactment of the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is the subsequent measure to <bill type="h" number="3085">H.R. 3085</bill>, the Trail of Tears Study Act which was signed into law in December 2006. <bill type="h" number="3085">H.R. 3085</bill> directed the National Park Service to complete a study on expanding the current Trail of Tears National Historic Trail to include previously omitted components. In 1987 when the original Trail was designated, the historical documentation available for these known passages was sparse and ambiguous. Since that time however, significant research on the proposed additions  has been documented by National Park Service historians through military journals, newspaper accounts and vouchers--compelling us to reconsider these passages. In fact, the NPS has noted that now these proposed trails are better documented than the primary routes that currently make up the Trail of Tears.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Cherokee removal is only one tribe's story of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, but it is the most visible in American history. It is not just an Arkansas and Oklahoma story; it started in North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama. These distinct routes and campgrounds proposed in the Trail of Tears Documentation Act more fully reflect this tragic saga of a proud people's forced removal. The story is not yet complete until we commemorate the full experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The arteries I want to highlight are the detachments led by John Benge that traveled 734 miles starting at Fort Payne, Alabama continuing through Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma. And the Treaty Party Group led by John Bell which traveled 765 miles starting at Charleston, Tennessee crossing west over Moccasin Bend and traveling through Arkansas. It was the only one of the 17 detachments that did not disband in Oklahoma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also included are 29 forts and the emigration depots concentrated around Fort Payne, Alabama; Ross's Landing--present day Chattanooga, Tennessee; and Fort Cass--present day Charleston, Tennessee where the Cherokee initially were taken after being rounded up from their homes for the long journey west.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Park Service has demonstrated strong partnerships geared toward respecting the private property of citizens in its administering of the current Trail of Tears National Historic Trail and will continue to do so upon the addition of the Benge, Bell Routes and associated components. In fact, as the NPS traveled throughout the U.S. conducting public hearings on the proposal in the designated areas, the support and belief in this initiative were overwhelming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The designation and interpretation of the additional sites and trails associated with the Cherokee Removal will enhance public understanding of American history. Our greatness as a nation is our ability to look at our own history objectively and in proper perspective, being mindful of the errors of the past in order  not to repeat them. Through this legislation we will honor the historic footsteps taken by the Cherokee and celebrate our future as we remember  the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, because of historical significance, <bill type="h" number="5335">H.R. 5335</bill> enjoys broad support not only within Congress, but also with the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee and associated trail organizations. The legislation is a good example of how Congress can better understand a national event through an accurate portrayal of the people, the places and the actions involved. We can learn a lot from history and in this case, ensure that it will never be repeated.</paragraph>
