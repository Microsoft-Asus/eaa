    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is timely for me to make these remarks because there has been a conversation that has occurred in Kansas today between the Governor of Kansas and the President of the United States over the question of the adequacy of the National Guard and its equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason I am making these remarks is that this Senator from Florida has sounded this alarm bell several weeks ago on the basis of a GAO report of the inadequacy of the equipment of the National Guard in each of the States. In my State of Florida, the GAO report says they only have 53 percent of their equipment. In the State of New Mexico, they only have 33 percent of their equipment. You now heard the commentary from both the Governor of Kansas, as well as the head of the National Guard, the  adjutant general of Kansas, who state they are short of equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can tell you that, in Florida, we are 500 humvees short. We are 600 trucks short--that is both 5 ton and deuce and a half. We are 4,400 night vision goggles short. Why I am saying this today as a follow-on to sounding this alarm several weeks ago is we are not far from June 1, which is the beginning of hurricane season. The Florida National Guard is the best trained as a National Guard but especially so for taking care of the aftermath of a hurricane. If we only have category 1, 2, and 3 hurricanes,  the Guard tells me they have the equipment. But if the big one hits--the big one being a category 4 or 5 hitting from the water--a highly densely urbanized area of the coast, they will be short. Then the Guard would rely on their compact with other Guard units to supply equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, Pennsylvania is one of those States in the compact. But Pennsylvania is short of equipment as well. We are trying to put additional appropriations in this war funding bill for equipment for our National Guard units, but as Lieutenant General Blum, the head of the National Guard for the country, said, they are $40 billion short of equipment. I will read you a statement from the Florida National Guard in case there is any doubt in anybody's mind:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is true that we are short of equipment. We need these pieces of equipment to speed up our response to local emergencies and to help save lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And he continues:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They can draw on these additional units and equipment through that compact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in the case of a major hurricane--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I continue to quote the Florida National Guard--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>we plan to have these other assets prepositioned prior to landfall or moving to Florida as soon as possible. However, we cannot afford any additional significant losses of equipment. Losing more equipment from Florida to support our active duty mobilization sites will put us at risk to respond effectively to our State during a time of great need. &lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to be serious all over this country about the equipment needs for our National Guard when it is called on to respond to that aspect of their job, which is to be activated by the Governor of the respective States under statewide emergencies.</paragraph>
