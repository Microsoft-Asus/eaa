  <narrative>PRESIDENT BUSH ASKS FOR ANOTHER $196 BILLION TO FUND THE WAR IN IRAQ IN 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11852]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, yesterday President Bush asked Congress to rubber-stamp his plan to spend $196 billion next year on the war in Iraq. I have to tell the President: not a nickel more for this war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the beginning of this year, congressional Democrats have been trying to change a war policy from one where our troops will stay there for more than a decade, to one where we have a responsible redeployment and bring the troops home next year. The President believes it's acceptable to spend billions of dollars in Iraq, while important domestic priorities here in our own country go unmet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the President was crafting his $196 billion war supplemental, the Democratic House approved appropriations bills that included targeted investments in our priorities here at home: education, health care for veterans, more police on the streets, caring for American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as Congress begins to examine the President's latest war-funding bill, we will once again demand that the President change course in Iraq and get a responsible plan to bring our troops home within the year.</paragraph>
