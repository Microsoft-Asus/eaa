  <narrative>HONORING SAFE HANDLING, INC. -- (Senate - May 13, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4103">S4103</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the remarkable achievements of a small Maine company that is doing business in an incredibly forward-thinking way. Safe Handling, Inc., of Auburn, is a cutting-edge transporter of industrial products, and both the firm and its president, Ford Reiche, have earned significant recognition, culminating in Mr. Reiche being named the U.S. Small Business Administration's 2008 Maine Small Business Person of the Year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded in 1989, Safe Handling offers businesses the convenience of both bulk product transportation and logistics, as well as toll processing, to enable them to more efficiently move their goods. Significantly, Safe Handling is responsible for both sensitive and hazardous materials. To safely handle these products, the firm runs the largest rail-to-truck transloading facilities in both New England and western Pennsylvania, where it has an additional transload yard and warehouse. Safe Handling  presently manages roughly a half million tons of products every year which translates to nearly 4,000 railcars and 12,000 truckloads of raw materials annually. It also operates the only ethanol terminal in Maine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Transporting such perilous materials requires Safe Handling to be mindful of many concerns, and the company has risen to the top as a leader in environmental safety by exceeding Federal and State requirements on a regular basis. Most recently, the company became the first Maine-owned business to earn both the ISO14001 and Responsible Care certifications, which address a host of health, safety, environmental, and security concerns. Of all its initiatives, Safe Handling has most visibly led the  way in reducing transportation emissions. The company ships dry products that it transfers into liquids, uses tri-axle trucks, provides long-haul rail services, and utilizes biodiesel fuel, all of which reduce discharge. Not surprisingly, the firm placed first in the Governor's</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of its innovative practices and proven track record, Safe Handling has garnered three prestigious awards this year alone. In March, Mainebiz magazine declared Ford Reiche its Executive of the Year in its large business category. Less than a month later, the Maine International Trade Center recognized Safe Handling as its Maine Innovative Company of the Year Award for the company's energy saving methods and customer savings. Additionally, the U.S. Small Business Administration presented  Mr. Reiche with its prestigious 2008 Maine Small Business Person of the Year for his "business expertise, commitment, creativity and community involvement." Mr. Reiche's dedication and knowledge inspire the nearly 100 employees of Safe Handling, and the company is a better place for his profound leadership skills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Safe Handling is truly a company of which all Mainers can be proud. Consistently seeking greater energy efficiency while never sacrificing its loyalty to its customers, Safe Handling promises to make the Lewiston-Auburn area--and Maine--a better place in every way. I am particularly impressed with the passion and enthusiasm of Mr. Reiche, who I was fortunate enough to meet with just a few weeks ago. His desire to create jobs and opportunities in Central Maine truly shined through during our time  together. I congratulate Ford Reiche and everyone at Safe Handling for their amazing accolades and pioneering enterprises, and wish them more of the success that they have already demonstrated.</paragraph>
