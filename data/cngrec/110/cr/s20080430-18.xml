  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL E. BAKER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is a privilege for me today to honor Mr. Michael E. Baker as he retires as president of Maryknoll School. I want to express a heartfelt mahalo nui loa--thank you very much--and best wishes with my warmest aloha as he retires after 11 years at the helm of the school with an unsurpassed record of achievements. He leaves a legacy which benefitted students and continues to do so and is appreciated by parents, alumni, and our educational community. His is a legacy of  a great leader and educator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former principal in our public school system, I agree wholeheartedly with the philosophy contained in Mr. Baker's "President's Message" in which he emphasize the critical importance of exceptional teachers in the commencement and development of students, intellectually and spiritually, and to inculcate them with these and all the other attributes necessary to develop into a valued member of our society. He has built on the solid foundation laid by his predecessors and attracted the very  best faculty recognized for their excellence locally, regionally, and nationally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As he retires from his stewardship of Maryknoll School to spend more time with his family, I also want to congratulate him for his leadership that made the Maryknoll School Community Center a reality. When completed, this much-needed first-rate center for the school's athletics program will be an important part of the school's curriculum as it continues to build success upon success for its students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I join President Michael E. Baker's family, colleagues, friends, and the community in wishing him Godspeed as he enters the next phase of his life. He has earned the right to enjoy his family and the simple pleasures of life in retirement.</paragraph>
