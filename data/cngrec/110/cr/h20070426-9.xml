  <speaking speaker="400285" topic="">
    <paragraph>The recent tragedy at Virginia Tech leads us to ask what else could have been done to protect students at our colleges and universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 is intended to protect the confidentiality of student records and define under what instances parents can have access to student information and grades. Unfortunately, under the definitions in the act, there are many examples where information was not released to parents or guardians regarding a student's mental health, which led to withholding of vital information that could have prevented suicides, assaults and other crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Schools are hesitant to release information for fear of legal action. In my 25 years of practice as a psychologist, I have known many instances where these problems arose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am introducing legislation to clarify the act to help define circumstances where universities can release vital information to parents, including risks for suicide, homicide and physical assaults. Further, it will hold harmless colleges and universities who, after consultation with a mental health specialist, act in the best interest of the student, where they can release information to help save lives. We can no longer let this 30-year act be a barrier between parents, students and schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to sign in support of this bill.</paragraph>
