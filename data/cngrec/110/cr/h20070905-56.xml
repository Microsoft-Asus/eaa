    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Private First Class Omar E. Torres, a courageous young soldier who died in Iraq on August 22.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Omar Torres grew up on Chicago's southwest side and played football at De La Salle High School. After graduating in 2005, Torres received a full ride scholarship to attend The Ohio State University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his freshman year at OSU, Torres followed his strong desire to serve his country and joined the U.S. Army Reserves. This decision led to his activation during his sophomore year, and in May of 2007, Torres was deployed to Iraq as part of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although his mission was hazardous, Private Torres bravely and honorably  carried out his duties. Sadly on August 22, PFC Torres was killed by an IED while patrolling Baghdad. He was only 20 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aside from his military service to our Nation, Omar Torres was interested in politics and had a strong desire to work for positive change in our country. While attending his wake last month, I was moved by the large number of lives PFC Torres had touched.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in mourning the loss of Private First Class Omar E. Torres. We will never forget his sacrifice and are forever indebted to him, as well as to all our soldiers. Our thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathies are with the Torres family and friends in this difficult time.</paragraph>
