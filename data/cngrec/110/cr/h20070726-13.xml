  <narrative>THE FARM BILL: URGING SUPPORT FOR THE KIND-FLAKE AMENDMENT -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8622]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is a bipartisan instinct in Congress that has been evident for years. We all want to reform our farm policies in the "next" farm bill. That is why the bill that is coming forward from the Agriculture Committee couldn't find any way to reform the crop insurance program. Luckily, it looks as though the Rules Committee will make in order a rule that will force that upon the committee, saving up to 40 cents on the dollar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are no meaningful limitations on extraordinarily wealthy farmers. They talk about reform, but the limitation raises only $46 million a year from 3,175 farmers. And if the farmer can't get their adjusted gross income under $1 million, they ought to get a new CPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to just read some of the news accounts like this morning's Washington Post that talks about what is in this bill. And if you do, I think you will join with us in supporting the Kind-Flake amendment.</paragraph>
