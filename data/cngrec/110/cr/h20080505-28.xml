    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut. I, like many of us, come to the floor -- (House of Representatives - May 05, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H3043]</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut. I, like many of us, come to the floor and want to congratulate Mr. Klein for his leadership on this issue and bringing us together actually in an area that I think most folks, if you reflect back, you can think of a favorite teacher. Let me tell you a little bit about one of my favorite teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My fourth grade teacher was Lillian Anderson. Lillian Anderson was 65 years old and I was in the last class. Maybe I caused her to retire, but I was the last class that Ms. Anderson had. Ms. Anderson was one of those people at Ben Franklin School in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, that began to open up our eyes, myself and my classmates, to the State of Illinois, and that's a tradition that we have in Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a fine product of the public schools in Illinois, you know that fourth graders in Illinois begin to learn about the State. We learn the State flower, the violet. We learn the State song, which I will not sing for you. We learn the State bird, the cardinal, and all of these things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what happened to me was in Ms. Anderson's class, beginning to learn about the three branches of government, in all of those things, suddenly this was a whole new area that was revealed to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I grew up in a family that wasn't active when it came to politics. My mom and dad would vote, but that was pretty much it. So here I was a young student, a young boy in Ms. Anderson's class, and a seed was planted by that dear woman. The seed was later watered for me when I was in eighth grade and took the Constitution test, and I was one of those kids in eighth grade that couldn't get enough of it, absolutely loved it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My point is that there were teachers along the way that encouraged and nurtured me, and I have a strong suspicion that, as we reflect, every one of us can point to somebody along the way, in addition to those people in our immediate families, but somebody along the way that encouraged us, that saw a little something in us, moved us along, took the time to pull us aside and give us an important word. I think that that legacy is the great benefit of the teaching profession today because they don't  know all of the ways in which they've influenced people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to thank Mr. Klein. I want to thank him for bringing this resolution to the floor, for having the Congress today pause and to reflect on those people who were influential in bringing us here today, and I know he's worked very hard to reach out to folks on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my friend from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) for yielding.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of this resolution urging the establishment of a National Teacher Day. Every day, thousands of men and women in this country wake up in the morning with a tremendous responsibility, this stressful and sometimes daunting task of educating our Nation's youth. We entrust these special people with our most precious resource, our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Devoted teachers make a difference in the lives of students from every age and background. Every one of us can point to so many exceptional educators whose impact allowed us to get where we are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Support for a national day honoring the hard work of teachers has been brewing since 1944 when an Arkansas schoolteacher, Maddie White Woodridge, began corresponding with education leaders about the need for a teacher's day. In 1953, Eleanor Roosevelt convinced the 81st Congress to establish the first National Teacher Day. Finally, in 1985, the National Parent Teacher Association declared the  first week in May as National Teacher Appreciation Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through their dedication and passion for service, teachers bridge the gap between the resources available and the vital need for a strong education, with sometimes too little compensation. They provide the tools necessary for success, and their sacrifice deserves national recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, in recognition of the crucial role teachers play in trying to make sure every child receives a quality education, it is appropriate we pass this important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the incredible teachers I have been fortunate to have over my life, it is appropriate for me to recognize and thank them. I am extraordinarily grateful for every teacher that I have had. They saw in me opportunities for growth--there sure was--but more important, they helped me to dream and to imagine I could be someone I wanted to be. I thank them for the skills they taught me and for helping me grow in the right direction. And I thank them for their love and care of me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield back my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400074" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in closing, I'd like to thank my friend from Florida (Mr. Klein) for bringing this resolution and to say that, after hearing the speakers today, it made me think about the impact some of my teachers had on my learning throughout my life. In the words of a famed historian and author, Henry Adams, he said, Teachers affect eternity because they can never tell you where their influence stops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, today, let us stand in support and recognition of the timeless influence of our country's teachers and educators by passing <bill type="hr" number="952">H. Res. 952</bill>, which expresses the sense of the House that there should be established a National Teacher Day to honor and celebrate teachers in the United States, and I urge passage of the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400125" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as the only former state schools' chief serving in Congress, I rise today in appreciation of the lasting impact that teachers make on the lives of all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each of us in the House have benefited from the care and guidance of a talented educator. Each of us knows, from personal experience and reports from our district, many of the amazing success stories in our schools today. These successes would not be possible without our dedicated teachers who lend their skills, experience, and passion to the task of educating our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am profoundly thankful to all of my teachers, who pushed me to succeed and taught me valuable lessons. Ms. Flossie Barber, who taught me at the Cleveland School, was the personification of teaching. Stern and tough, but always caring with each and every student, her early lessons enabled me to achieve my goals and more. Coach Bruce Coats taught me what it meant to be a member of a team and how to contribute to the greater good. I hope that everyone has the privilege of great teachers like these,  and remembers to give them thanks for their hard work and inspiration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too often, we do not give our teachers the respect and esteem that they deserve. This day, and really this whole week, is an opportunity to stop and remember the professional educators who work every day to build a bright future for our children and our Nation. Their efforts shape the world of tomorrow, and they deserve our support every day throughout the year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, with your leadership, the New Direction Congress is ensuring that our teachers get the support they need to continue their work to educate our children. We have committed to fully funding No Child Left Behind and other federal mandates that have been shortchanged by the current administration. We also must pass new teacher training and staff development initiatives to help our educators hone and maintain the skills they need to teach our children well. We have made great strides  in recent years to improve our schools, and, on this National Teacher Day should recommit to build on that record of success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Improving education in this country is about creating a classroom environment where children can learn. My colleagues and I have crafted bipartisan legislation to provide critical investments in school construction and modernization across the country. The RANGEL-RAMSTAD-ETHERIDGE America's Better Classrooms Act will provide $25 billion in interest-free bonds for local schools. This bill will make a real difference for our communities, our children, and their teachers. I have also introduced  legislation to ensure that students and teachers have a safe place to learn that is equipped to respond to any disaster. The Schools Empowered to Respond Act will support schools in their efforts to keep children safe and implement robust emergency management plans. On this National Teacher Day, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The work of our dedicated teachers inspires our students every day, and I have been inspired by so many educators who give much to our communities. I thank them for their work, and do so every day.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400415" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the establishment of a National Teacher Day to honor and celebrate teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Teachers are the cornerstone of our Nation's schools. We ask them to be educators and mentors. We ask them to work long hours, keep order in crowded classrooms, and respond creatively to individual student needs. They consistently rise to meet the challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should recognize their contributions, but we should also take tangible steps to assist them. And that means funding for our schools, high quality training, and fair pay. It means making sure that every teacher is prepared to walk into the classroom and every teacher has support through the school day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We trust our Nation's teachers with our most important task--caring for and educating our children. National Teacher Day will remind us to honor their commitment and support that mission.</paragraph>
