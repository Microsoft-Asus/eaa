  <narrative>WHO DO WE FIGHT? -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6013]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, who do we fight against? We have been at war in Iraq and Afghanistan for years. We heard that we are fighting a war on terror. But what does that mean? Who are the people at war with America?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, after all this time, our government has decided we must have a politically correct name for our enemy. No longer can we use the term "Jihadist," the primary meaning being a holy war to subject the world to Islam. After all, using that term might hurt our enemies' feelings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And certainly the most accurate term, "Islamo-Fascists," is strictly taboo because it might further anger our enemies by insinuating they are a bit radical when they murder in the name of religion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the government insists that we call the bad guys "extremists" or "terrorists."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That vague term won't indicate the war against us is waged in the name of radical Muslim religious doctrine. But isn't that the reason for this war?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The term "Jihadist" is not a reflection on all Muslims. After all, many Muslims are literally fighting these radical ideas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a war, we must specifically define our enemy. Otherwise, we don't know who they are or why we fight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
