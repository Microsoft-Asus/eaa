    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, good evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago I had the privilege to visit our service men and women serving in Iraq, and I saw for myself what is really happening on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met with several service men and women from cities that I represent, the city of Azusa, East Los Angeles and West Covina in California. I spoke with troop commanders, Iraqi women representing NGOs, and two parliamentarian women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My trip to Iraq confirmed my belief that we must supply better support for our troops, including redeployment out of Iraq. But supporting our troops means securing our troops and making sure we minimize the risks they really face. Our troops, as you know, are overextended. The length of time they are spending in Iraq is not only demanding, but exhausting. For many of them, it is not their first tour either, this is their second, third and maybe even fourth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While our troops remain committed to their work, they are concerned about the impact their duty is having on them and their families. The time they spend with their families is shorter with each tour of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our troops are concerned about the lack of adequate equipment. Some troops lack the basic equipment needed to do their job, like body armor. In fact, one soldier told me they don't have light bulbs. I said light bulbs for what? They said well, Congresswoman, for our vehicles. When we are asked to go into the communities, if we don't have light bulbs on our vehicles we can't see. Another one mentioned they didn't have scissors, and I said, Why do you need scissors? And he said because if one of  my men gets hit, I need to have scissors to be able to bandage and provide whatever help that person needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In some cases they told me that the equipment they use is unreliable due to overexcessive use. And I was appalled to learn that some service members are forced to share their equipment with recent arrivals. The new members of the service that we are sending in in this surge or escalation are actually taking equipment away from those who are being currently deployed there. Without the proper equipment, our troops face significant and unnecessary risk to their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Supporting our troops also means redeployment and an Iraqi nation that will govern itself and its people. Unfortunately, the best plan President Bush offers is another blank check request for his already failed policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In California, the 32nd Congressional District that I represent, as you can see, 13 of our sons have already given their lives, the ultimate sacrifice. U.S. casualties, as you know, are close to 3,200, and more than 24,000 service men and women have been injured or permanently disabled, and more than half of those will not be able to lead normal lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This blank check that President Bush provides must end. By deploying additional service men and women into combat, the President shows just how out of touch he is with the real needs of our troops and the reality of the situation. The increase of troops will do nothing to improve the long-term security situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's escalation plan ignores the very needs of these veterans. The crisis, as you know, at Walter Reed highlights the fact that this administration has not prioritized the health care needs of our returning veterans. And as Members of Congress, it is our responsibility to protect our troops and veterans when our Commander in Chief will not. We need a plan that will ensure that there will not be permanent bases in Iraq. And we need to ensure that all troops are provided with adequate  equipment and training needed to do their job safely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our plan must require the Iraqis to take control of Iraq and bring other Arab states together to help solve this problem. Our plan must refocus also on Afghanistan. And our plan must ensure that our service men and women and veterans receive the best care available when they return home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This includes traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, culturally competent health care, housing, and education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The troops and their families have kept their promise to us. We must now keep our promise to them, and I am proud that we have made such a plan available. The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health &amp; Iraq Accountability Act, in my opinion, is key to this success. It supports our troops. It holds the administration accountable. It establishes a plan for redeployment, and provides for our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My trip to Iraq strengthened my belief that the right course of action is to redeploy our troops out of Iraq. Our men and women in uniform are doing their job, and we in Congress must do ours so that our troops will come home and receive the care that they deserve. We must not continue to turn our backs on those who proudly have served our Nation, and I will continue to fight and support our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to their redeployment and their safe return to their families, to their friends, and to their loved ones, and I look forward to a resolution, and an Iraq governed by Iraqis, and a world safer and more secure for all of us. And I know our leadership will help to take us there.</paragraph>
