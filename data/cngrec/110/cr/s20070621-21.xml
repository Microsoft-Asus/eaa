  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize a community in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th anniversary. On July 5-8, the residents of Hope will gather to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded in 1882, Hope is a small town in Steele County located in eastern North Dakota. The post office was established in 1881, and it became a city in 1904. The community was named in honor of Hope A. Hubbard Steele, wife of E.H. Steele, for whom the county was named.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The residents of Hope describe their town as an active and close-knit community. When a function or task needs to be completed, the residents work together to accomplish it. Many of the recreational facilities, such as the outdoor swimming pool and the nine hole golf course, are supported by local organizations and the community. The local Sportsmen's Club purchased a building from the community for one dollar and converted it into a 24-hour youth recreational facility. A further investment into  the community was made by residents when they purchased La Rinascente Pasta, a New Jersey based pasta company, that was relocated to Hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The residents are excited to commemorate their upcoming anniversary with a weekend celebration that will include a parade, a Texas Hold 'em Tournament, a tractor pull, and many other activities. In addition, there will be a Veterans Memorial dedication that will feature a cannon from the Civil War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Hope, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well in the future. By honoring Hope and all the other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Hope that have helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hope has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
