    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, just this morning we received reports that the al Qaeda leader in Iraq has been killed. Despite such signs that support for the terrorist group in Iraq is fading, Democrats in Congress continue to advocate retreat and defeat. Fortunately for American families and our troops in the battlefield, we have a Commander in Chief who understands that victory is essential. As the Washington Post has editorialized: "America's defeat will lead to catastrophic  civilian deaths, the reestablishment of terrorist training camps, and possibly a regional war. We must face the terrorists overseas, or we will face them again in the streets of America."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation is at war. Our troops are bravely serving their country. We have a responsibility to provide for their well-being. I support President Bush's pending veto and look forward to passing a clean supplemental bill that fully funds our soldiers' mission of protecting American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
