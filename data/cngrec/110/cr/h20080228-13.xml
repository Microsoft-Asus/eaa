    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when I go home and I talk to my constituents, they understand and appreciate that it is the primary responsibility of Congress to protect our Nation. All Americans believe we should be able to determine what terrorists are saying to terrorists overseas. Playing politics with our Nation's intelligence capabilities only serves to harm our national security. And despite proof of a bipartisan majority of support in the Senate which passed the FISA bill 68-29, House  Democrat leadership allowed these protections to expire without a vote. To expire without a vote. Astounding, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're now 13 days into a unilateral disarmament on the part of our Nation.  The ability to obtain the right information at the right time is of critical importance in our struggle against radical terrorists who hide among civilian populations and quietly plot deadly attacks. The Protect America Act moved our intelligence capabilities in the right direction. The Senate understood that in a bipartisan way. The American people understand that. We hope and  pray that the Speaker and the Democrat leadership will come to their senses and allow a vote on the Protect America Act.</paragraph>
