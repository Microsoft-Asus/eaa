    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people have entrusted us with a great responsibility to represent their interest in this great House. The people of the Seventh District of Tennessee work hard and represent what is good about America, and it is my honor to speak on their behalf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district there are farmers, bankers, truckers, accountants. My district is as diverse as America itself. One thing they believe in is the goodness and strength and perseverance of our country. They entrust us to do the right thing, no matter the circumstances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They want lower taxes and believe that they, not the Federal Government, should have first right of refusal on their paycheck. They believe that if 10 percent is good enough for God, it should be good enough for the government when it comes to taxing that paycheck. And they think that government should learn to live within its means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most importantly, they want action, not political grandstanding. They want results, not rhetoric. They want and expect us to solve problems. They expect us to stand in the gap, stand up for them, and do our jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They expect us to lead.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
