    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is with great sorrow that I learned of the death my dear friend Johnny Grant, known internationally as the honorary Mayor of Hollywood. His departure from our lives has created a significant void in the normal glitz and glamour of everyday Hollywood. Johnny was a symbol of great Hollywood movers and shakers who took sincere interest in creating goodwill worldwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Johnny's legendary accomplishments in Hollywood drew strongly from his roots in radio and television. He was one of television medium's earliest pioneers and stars. Johnny traveled the world to entertain U.S. troops in his role as the United Service Organization ambassador. He joined comedian Bob Hope in taking entertainers to war zones to perform for military personnel and was the first recipient of the highest honor awarded by the USO. Johnny was also a retired major general in the California  State Military Reserve, a volunteer backup and support force of the National Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Johnny Grant served as chairman of the Los Angeles City Fire Commission; the Los Angeles County Social Service Commission; and the Burbank, California Police Commission. More recently, he had been a member of the Los Angeles City Cultural Heritage Commission. He was the only person ever to twice receive an Order of California, the State's highest honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lifelong bachelor, Johnny Grant was best known to television audiences around the world as the enthusiastic host alongside the more than 500 celebrities he inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame. With his ebullient style, Johnny was one of the west coast's most sought after masters of ceremony. He emceed more than 5,000 civic and charity events. Johnny was also a humanitarian who produced hundreds of charity events where he was instrumental in raising millions of dollars for the USO, for  the Boy Scouts, the Arthritis Foundation, police and fire services, veterans organizations, and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although he has an honorary star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the real star, his presence and inspiration will be sorely missed. We will miss him. And just last month he completed his 60th trip to entertain servicemen and women abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We extend our most heartfelt condolences to his family, colleagues, and his many close friends here on Capitol Hill, in California, and around the world.</paragraph>
