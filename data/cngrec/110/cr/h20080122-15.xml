    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of <bill type="h" number="3720">H.R. 3720</bill>, which names the postal facility in Waco, Texas, after Army PFC Juan Alonso Covarrubias.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3720">H.R. 3720</bill>, which was introduced by Representative CHET EDWARDS on October 7, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on December 12, 2007, by voice vote. This measure has been cosponsored by 31 Members and has the support of the entire Texas delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is named after a servicemember who served and died as an airborne paratrooper in the Vietnam war in 1969. As a member of the Army Selective Service, he served in Thua Thien, South Vietnam. Through his efforts and sacrifice, he was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, and Bronze Star Medal. His name appears on the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, DC. I urge swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on April 19, 1948, an American hero was born. His name was Juan Alonso Covarrubias. He was raised in Waco, Texas, but moved to Dallas, where he was drafted in 1968 into the United States Army. At the age of 20, he served courageously in Vietnam as an airborne paratrooper. It was there on April 24, 1969, in the Thua Thien Province, where he tragically lost his life while defending his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Army Private First Class Covarrubias was buried with full military honors on April 4, 1969. Among his awards and decorations for his remarkable achievements are the Bronze Star Medal, Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, Expert Badge and Rifle Bar, Marksman Badge with Auto Rifle Bar, Sharpshooter Badge and Machine Gun Bar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>His service has also been acknowledged at the Waco Vietnam Veterans Memorial and on the veterans wall in Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let us recognize the courageous service and ultimate sacrifice of Army Private First Class Juan Alonso Covarrubias by renaming the post office located at 424 Clay Avenue in Waco, Texas, in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he may require to the Member from Texas (Mr. Edwards) who sponsored this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me first thank my colleagues for joining with me in honoring this great American. I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3720">H.R. 3720</bill>, which salutes the service and sacrifice of Army Private First Class Juan Alonso Covarrubias by naming a U.S. Post Office in Waco, Texas, my hometown, in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For generations to come, citizens in Waco will be reminded that Mr. Covarrubias in the prime of his life in 1969, in the words of Lincoln, gave his "last full measure of devotion" to country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In doing so, Mr. Covarrubias joined the hallowed hall of heroes who, throughout our Nation's history, have given their lives and duty to country. Juan Alonso Covarrubias was born on April 19, 1948. He was raised in Waco and, as mentioned, later moved to Dallas. In 1968, he answered his country's call to duty. He served in the Army's famed 101st Airborne Division and arrived in Vietnam on November 28, 1968, as a young 20-year-old airborne paratrooper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 24, 1969, just 1 month after the birth of his daughter, Tammy, this young father gave his life so very far from home. It is that type of incredible sacrifice that should remind us all that we are the land of the free, because we are still the home of the brave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With full military honors, Mr. Covarrubias was buried in Waco on Good Friday in 1969. While his final resting place may be there at Waco Memorial Park, I have faith that his spirit will touch the lives of others who will be inspired by this young man's love of country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Covarrubias is honored at the Waco Vietnam Veterans Memorial and on the Veterans Wall in Washington D.C. He earned the National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, the Bronze Star Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, Expert Badge with Rifle Bar, Marksman Badge with Auto Rifle Bar, and the Sharpshooter Badge with Machine Gun Bar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon the passage of this bill into law, thousands of Waco citizens who visit the U.S. Post Office at 424 Clay Avenue, just blocks away from the Waco VA regional office, will be touched by the life and sacrifice of the young man raised in their neighborhood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that Hispanic Americans, who have time and again served our Nation in combat with distinction, will take special pride in knowing that Private First Class Covarrubias will forever stand as a symbol of all Hispanics who so patriotically served America in uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I especially want to thank my friend, a Vietnam veteran and a great veterans leader, Robert Gamboa, for working on this legislation to ensure that Mr. Covarrubias's service would never be forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I believe the families and loved ones of our servicemen and women are truly the unsung heroes and heroines in our Nation's defense. That is why I want to express my respect to the family of Mr. Covarrubias, his 97-year-old father, Juan Covarrubias; his brother, Gilbert; his sister, Irene Covarrubias Ramirez; and his daughter, Tammy Covarrubias Boyett.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to say to the Covarrubias family, which sacrificed so much for the American family, that a grateful Nation owes you a great, deep debt of gratitude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to say to Tammy that while you never got to know your father in person, I hope you will always be proud that he loved you so much that he was willing to sacrifice his life for the country in which his little girl would be raised. Surely he must look down upon you now from a special place in heaven reserved for those who would lay down their lives for their neighbors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Private Covarrubias's father, I would say, myself, as the father of two young sons, that no father should ever have to see his own son buried. But I hope you take comfort and pride in knowing that the spirit of your son that you helped bring into this world will be touching and inspiring the lives of others long after we are gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Juan Alonso Covarrubias is an American hero who gave his life in defending our country in Vietnam. We humbly recognize that we could never fully repay him or his family and loved ones for their loss. But I hope and pray that honoring him in this way will celebrate his dedicated service and preserve his memory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, with honor and respect for the life of Juan Alonso Covarrubias, I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="3720">H.R. 3720</bill>.</paragraph>
