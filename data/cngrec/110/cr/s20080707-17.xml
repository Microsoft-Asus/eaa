  <narrative>UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 6304 -- (Senate - July 07, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="6354">S6354</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previous order with respect to <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>--that is the FISA legislation--be modified as follows: that all debate time on the amendments must be utilized during Tuesday's session; and that on Wednesday, at 9:30 a.m., immediately after the opening of the Senate, the Senate resume <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>, with the debate time previously specified prior to the cloture vote commencing at that time; with Senator Bingaman controlling 10 minutes of  the time controlled by the majority leader; and that after all debate time has been used or yielded back, the Senate then proceed to vote in relation to the amendments, that upon disposition of the amendments, the Senate then vote on the motion to invoke cloture, and then passage, as previously ordered; provided further that the previous order with respect to debate time between votes and the vote time and sequence and all other provisions of the previous order remain in effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, if the Chair would withhold, this is the matter about which I spoke to the Senate earlier today. I, of course, have conferred with the distinguished Republican leader. What we want to do--the order is set now that we would do all the debate time and all the votes tomorrow. We are not sure how late the plane will be getting back from North Carolina. This morning we had one Democratic Senator--there may be two or three--now going to North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So rather than having people who are here waiting around until the plane gets back, we will complete all the debate tomorrow, and then vote, and have all the time used up except what I have outlined here, Wednesday morning. I would assume we would start voting probably at around 11:15, and we would complete those votes well before the caucus of the Republicans on Wednesday.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <chair>Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I could also inform Senators, there are storms in the Midwest and, as a result of that, we have received calls. I guess what happens after a holiday, we have Democrats and Republicans who may not be here 20 minutes after 5:30. We are not going to do any heavy lifting after the vote tonight anyway, so we are going to keep the vote open for a while to see if some Senators who would like to be recorded--I do not think it will be a close vote--have that opportunity, both  Democrats and Republicans. As everyone knows, we have had a rule around here that, unless it is a close vote, we close it as quickly as we can after the time has expired. We will continue doing that. But I thought tonight it would be appropriate to not cut people off because of these flights being delayed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, of course, the previous order with respect to counting postcloture time, if cloture is invoked--there is an order already in effect for that--and that would remain as if cloture had been invoked at 5 p.m. today. We will invoke it a little later today when the time is up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
