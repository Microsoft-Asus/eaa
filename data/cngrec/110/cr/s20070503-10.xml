    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to speak for a brief moment about recent Senate approval of the America COMPETES Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is the product of several years of work by many individuals here in the Senate and it was immensely gratifying to see this bill pass the Senate. For the last 3 years Senators from numerous committees, Republicans and Democrats, have worked together on this legislation. They saw America falling behind the rest of the world in math and science and realized the need to do something. Well I believe this bill is going to do that something. It will double spending on physical science  research, provide money to recruit 10,000 new math and science teachers and retrain hundreds of thousands of our existing ones. This bill is a huge step in the right direction for our country, a step that could not have been taken by just one Senator or one party. In these often partisan times, the America COMPETES Act is a fine example of what this body can accomplish when it works together in a bipartisan manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud of the work my colleague from New Mexico Senator Bingaman, Senator Alexander and I put into this legislation. I am proud that the members of our committee, Energy and Natural Resources, continue to work in this bipartisan way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, I ask unanimous consent that two articles concerning the America COMPETES Act, one from the  Santa Fe New Mexican, the West's oldest newspaper, and one by David Broder of the Washington Post be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
