  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400209" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today is the 119th day since a great injustice took place in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 17, 2007, two U.S. Border Patrol agents entered Federal prison to begin serving 11 and 12-year sentences respectively. I am hopeful that this will be the month that House Judiciary Chairman JOHN CONYERS and Senate Judiciary Chairman PATRICK LEAHY will hold a hearing to investigate the injustice perpetrated against these two U.S. Border Patrol agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Agents Compean and Ramos were convicted last spring for wounding a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 734 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. These agents never should have been persecuted. Yet the U.S. Attorney's Office granted immunity to the drug smuggler and prosecuted the agents who were doing their job to protect our borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The illegal drug smuggler received full medical care in El Paso, Texas, was permitted to return to Mexico and has sued the Border Patrol for $5 million for violating his civil rights. Many Members of this House, including Congressman TED POE, who is a former judge from Texas, have voiced concerns about the unfair prosecution of these agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the troubling revelations surrounding the leadership of the U.S. Justice Department, I believe it is necessary to investigate the U.S. Attorney's Office in western Texas and the prosecutor's actions in this case. Never in America should the Congress sit by and allow a breakdown of honesty and integrity in our Nation's judicial system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if the American people cannot have faith in our Federal courts, I am afraid the future of our democracy is in danger. For the sake of these agents and their families and the integrity of our judicial system, I am pleased and grateful that Mr. Conyers and Senator Leahy will be holding hearings to investigate the injustice perpetrated against these two agents.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Michigan, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are very few instances where I have had a Member of Congress persist in the search for justice with the same zeal as my friend from North Carolina, and I commend you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recall that I had an opportunity to meet the widow of the slain officer, and I have talked to the gentleman from Virginia, BOBBY SCOTT, chairman of the Crime Subcommittee, and his ranking member about the importance that we pursue at the earliest possible moment a complete and total investigation and hearing about the matter that the gentleman and other colleagues that have now joined you have persisted in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate you, and recommit publicly once again to our search and pursuit of justice, because if we don't protect our border agents and law enforcement officials generally, I can only shudder to think how the safety of this country will deteriorate.</paragraph>
