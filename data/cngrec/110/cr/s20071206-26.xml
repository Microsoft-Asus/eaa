  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, to highlight something that was in the New York Times last Friday--it was Friday, November 30--at the bottom of page A12, in the midst of all of this discussion we have had in this country over the National Intelligence Estimate on Iran--and properly so that we debate that and discuss that--all of the discussion on crises and challenges in our foreign policies that threaten our national security, the ongoing debate about Iraq, in the midst of all of that, we see in  the New York Times and other publications a headline that reads as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Slovakia, three are held in a uranium smuggling case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is this all about? Well, it is about what a lot of people believe is maybe the greatest nightmare we face in the country: that a small group of terrorists can get a hold of fissile material and create a nuclear weapon, any kind of even unsophisticated nuclear weapon or dirty bomb--however you want to describe the various types of weapons that can be developed--and explode it in an American city or explode  it in a Western city, maybe, across the  world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But here is what happened in this case. This is cause for alarm because of the lack of attention that is being paid to this issue in the press, frankly, and also when the press asks Presidential candidates questions in debates because it has not been a subject of much debate at all. I am talking about three individuals, two Hungarians and a Ukrainian, who were arrested last Wednesday after trying to sell highly enriched uranium, according to diplomats in that part of the world. Now, it was only  half a kilogram, and the poundage was very limited. We know you need a lot more kilograms, a lot more pounds to have a real threat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But here is the problem. We have an administration that has had a series of recommendations made to it over many years now about ways we can prevent this nightmare from taking place. I gave a speech a couple of weeks ago, and a lot of Members of this body have been concerned about this issue for years. But the administration has not shown the kind of leadership we need to prevent the nightmare of nuclear terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What can we do? Well, there are a couple of things we can do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Very simply, this country could lead an effort, an international effort to create a global library of fissile material so we can track this material if an explosion occurred or if a terrorist attack occurred. Countries would be accountable if we did that. But this administration has not shown a willingness to show real leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, we should treat an issue such as this as a crime against humanity. That is another step which should be taken, and this administration should lead that effort. Unfortunately, they have not. They have allowed a real gap in the work to persist so that other groups, international groups, groups here in America, nonproliferation groups across the country have had to take up the ball, so to speak, and run with it because this administration does not show the leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask this administration, I would implore them that even in the last year of an 8-year administration, they take this issue very seriously, even if this particular case that was pointed out in the New York Times and other places was by a small group of very unsophisticated people across the world. At some point in time, we are going to be faced with the challenge of a very sophisticated group of terrorists. It might be al-Qaida, which is seeking to do this every day of the week. That is  the nightmare, and we are not prepared for it, we are not spending enough time on it. The administration should lead this effort. The next administration as well as this Congress has to show leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a gentle but firm reminder from a story just last week. It is a real threat to our existence, and it is a threat to our national security in and of itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412242" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
