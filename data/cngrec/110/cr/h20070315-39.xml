  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the House, and I rise today to alert my colleagues to a bill, <bill type="h" number="328">H.R. 328</bill>. And I rise to alert them and to speak in disbelief, truly disbelief, at this bill that the majority is preparing to bring to the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, it is hard to say, after some of the legislation that has been offered this year, but this is clearly the most egregious and unconstitutional bill that we have seen proposed to be brought to the floor of the House. In fact, some folks, some constitutional scholars, have said this is the most unconstitutional bill that they have ever seen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Article I, section 2 of the Constitution states unequivocally: "The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by the people of the several States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the majority has held hearings on a bill and they have passed a bill out of committee that totally disregards this portion of the Constitution. It is a bill to give the District of Columbia a seat, and a voting seat, in the House of Representatives, a clear violation of the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats have apparently taken their majority to mean that they can run roughshod over the Constitution. Madam Speaker, this is a sad and distressing state of affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is really a very simple issue. The Founders of our Nation wisely determined that the House of Representatives was to be composed by Members elected by the States. Now, the last time I looked, Washington, D.C. is not a State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we are the longest surviving democracy in the history of the world and on the face of the Earth for a reason. There is a reason for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Founders of our great Nation, the authors of our Constitution, were brilliant individuals. People around the world still marvel at what they created in our Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, do Democrats think that Washington, D.C. was not given a seat in the House of Representatives as an oversight?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Was the over-200-year history of our Federal city's place outside of statehood the result of a lapse in judgment?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Constitutional scholars have repeatedly found that the Founders did not believe it to be appropriate for the site of the Federal Government to be a State. They never wanted the seat of the Federal Government to be considered a State, clearly, because of the conflicts that creates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress simply does not have the authority to grant a non-state full congressional representation. But why are they doing this now? Why is the Democrat majority doing this?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, Madam Speaker, it is because they can, because they have got the votes. What an incredible abuse of power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Constitution addresses House membership very clearly. The legislative branch and the House of Representatives was so important to our Founders that it is the first thing discussed in the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Article I, section 1, literally, the third sentence of the Constitution reads: "The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by people of the several States." The several States, Madam Speaker. It is clear. And Washington, D.C. is not a State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, some may try to construe that statement to mean that the United States is the whole Nation, but the Constitution goes further to make this point even more clear. It says: "No person shall be a representative who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen." You must be a resident of a State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This isn't just my opinion. The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research service of Congress, filled with constitutional and congressional scholars, released a report that affirms that this bill is unconstitutional. It violates the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this is a clear power grab. Now, I believe strongly that the citizens of the District should have representation. The right to vote is a sacred one, but so is the document that every one of us takes the oath to support, uphold and defend. We can't just disregard the Constitution. It is the supreme document of our land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The options are to pass a constitutional amendment identifying the District of Columbia as a State, or to cede the land of the District of Columbia that has residents back to the State of Maryland. It is what happened in 1846 when the land west of the Potomac was ceded back to the State of Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the process that the majority is employing here is completely unfounded. We shouldn't be surprised, however. This new majority has taken the liberty to throw process out the door when they took over. Now they are tossing the Constitution out the door.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I will continue to honor the oath to support and defend and uphold our Constitution. It is a sacred document, the bedrock of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new majority claims to be the most open and honest and ethical government ever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, what is open about trampling on the Constitution? What is honest about trampling on the Constitution? What is ethical about trampling on the Constitution?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the American people are watching, and they don't like what they see.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
