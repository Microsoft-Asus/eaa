  <speaking speaker="400384" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today I rise in strong support of legislation that I recently introduced, <bill type="h" number="1968">H.R. 1968</bill>, the Community Health Workers Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill provides Federal support for community health workers, also known as promotoras. Community health workers conduct education and provide prevention information on chronic illnesses to communities of color, the Asian, Latino, African American and even Native American communities. They are able to reach out to patients in ways that traditional health care providers can't, through culturally and linguistically appropriate care. They are trusted by their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Families who interacted with community workers were eight times more likely to obtain health insurance for their children, and their children stayed insured. That is why I strongly believe that the community health workers need to be part of the SCHIP reauthorization bill moving forward in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus' Health Task Force, I am committed to reducing health care disparities in our country. The legislation will help achieve that goal, and I am proud to have the support of other colleagues here today.</paragraph>
