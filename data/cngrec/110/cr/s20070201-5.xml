    <paragraph>Mr. President, my goal as a boy was to be a baseball player. I loved to listen to those baseball games, and I could see myself in my mature years chasing balls down in the outfield and hitting doubles to bring in the winning run. That didn't happen in my life, but I have had the wonderful experience here in the Senate of being able to talk, as I was for a few minutes this morning, to a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame, JIM BUNNING. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope these pages here understand that they have a rare opportunity, to be able to be in the same room, to shake someone's hand who is a member of the Hall of Fame. It was my first time, during Thanksgiving, to visit the Baseball Hall of Fame, and I came away with the realization of how few people are in that Baseball Hall of Fame. JIM BUNNING is one of them. We talked a few minutes this morning, and I asked him questions, such as: Who are the good catchers who caught you? And he said:  Lots of them. And we talked today about Clay Dalrymple, the man who caught his perfect game, and Gus Triandos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So just a little offshoot, Mr. President. We are so fortunate to be Members of the Senate for lots of reasons, not the least of which is that we are able to serve with a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
