  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400122" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would first like to commend our distinguished colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), for introducing this important resolution that congratulates Mr. Sarkozy on being elected the next President of France.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over two centuries ago, the people of France assisted the people of the United States in their pursuit of independence during the American Revolution. Since then, the U.S. and France have shared an extensive and mutually beneficial relationship. Today, the United States and France are major economic partners, with nearly $1 billion in trade taking place between the two countries each and every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>France is the United States' ninth largest partner for trade in goods and sixth largest partner for trade and services. The United States and France are scientific and technical partners as well. Research institutions and private companies in both countries participate in extensive scientific collaboration on a wide range of issues, including computer development, biotechnology, and space exploration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This spirit of cooperation also typifies the cultural exchange that takes place between American and French academic institutions, museums, and theatres. In light of our continued friendship between the people of the United States and France, we are honored that President Sarkozy will be appearing before a joint session of Congress this week on November 7, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, which congratulates Mr. Nicholas Sarkozy on his election to the presidency of France and welcomes President Sarkozy to Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might also add that it is especially nice that the leader of France has demonstrated time and time again that he has warm feelings towards the United States of America and is, indeed, a pro-American leader of France. The relations between the United States and France in the past several years has been a little frosty, and it's nice to see that those frosty relations have thawed. It's nice to see a leader of France who understands and wants to work with the United States and understands that  we have a very close, long-standing relationship between our people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I welcome President Sarkozy. I look forward to hearing him when he speaks before a joint session of the House and Congress later on this week. I think that this resolution is a fitting tribute to him, and I believe that the United States and France, under his leadership, will enjoy warm ties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I can think a bit about my French from grammar school, I could say, Vive la France.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400040" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The great nation of France and the United States of America have a shared heritage of commitment to freedom and independence. From time to time, of course, we have made different choices or followed different paths in our commitment to the rule of law, human rights and democracy, but we in the United States are always grateful to have France's collaboration in advancing important foreign policy and security objectives. The newly elected President of France, Mr. Nicholas Sarkozy, is this week  paying an official visit to Washington and will address a joint meeting of this Congress during his visit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His visit prompts us to recall some of the expressions of support Mr. Sarkozy has offered to our country and some of the concrete steps he has, indeed, taken to join with the United States in addressing key issues of our day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the eve of the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, then-French Interior Minister Nicholas Sarkozy traveled to New York City to demonstrate solidarity with the American people on that occasion. During his visit, Mr. Sarkozy paid tribute to New York City's Police and Fire Departments as part of the commemoration of the anniversary and noted as part of his remarks the following: "One thing is sure in the history of our two peoples, each time we faced a challenge, France was able to  count on the United States of America."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He then presented to the New York Fire Department the French Medal of Honor, the very first time that the medal, the highest award for French firefighters, has been awarded to foreigners. By taking such actions, as both Minister of the Interior and now as the President of France, Mr. Sarkozy has won the appreciation of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note that his attitude regarding the necessity of preventing Iran from achieving its nuclear ambitions, his expressed support for the nation of Israel and his praise for the United States as a land of opportunity are very much appreciated as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we are glad to have France as an ally, and we hope to deepen the friendship and partnership that the United States and France have enjoyed so many times in the history of our two countries. As the cochair of the Congressional French Caucus, I believe that the resolution before us today helps send a message of continued friendship with the people of France while congratulating President Sarkozy on his election and welcoming him to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask all of my colleagues to join in supporting this very timely resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have one additional speaker.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400122" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would continue to reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400040" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) as much time as he may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400115" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my good friend from Arkansas, the cochair of the U.S.-French Caucus, and appreciate his thoughtful remarks as well as the remarks of my friend from New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise because I think it is really a great day that we are once again, after what could only be considered as somewhat of a hiatus in this institution, underscoring the importance of the relationship between the United States and France. It's very clear that there was a period of time when we were quite critical of France and, in fact, we all know that the sort of the politically correct thing to do was to engage in French bashing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I always had a tough time with that myself. One of the reasons is that as we are here in this Chamber, the portrait just to my right is of the man who underwrote the American Revolution, Marquis de Lafayette. In fact, his portrait is the only portrait of a non- American that hangs anywhere in this great building, the U.S. Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For us to recognize, as my friend from Arkansas just has said in his remarks, the great new, renewed friendship with the election of President Sarkozy between the United States and France is, I think, a great thing. I am very enthused about 11 o'clock Wednesday morning when we are in this very Chamber going to hear the words of France's new President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my friend said, for Nicholas Sarkozy, before he became President, when he was a minister on the fifth anniversary of September 11, to go to New York and demonstrate his solidarity with those who stood up to the terrorists and, again, his great assistance in working with us in supporting the State of Israel, in making sure that we do everything that we can to diminish the threat of the potential nuclear buildup in Iran; of course, the kinds of missions that Nicholas Sarkozy has embarked on  most recently to return the hostages of many conflicts around is something that, I believe, is to be heralded. We just had the news this morning that President Sarkozy personally was able to see the return of, I think it was seven nurses, who had been held hostage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So his commitment to the cause of freedom and liberty, and I will say, yes, his underscoring the great importance of the relationship and the alliance between France and the United States of America is a great thing for us. I congratulate my colleagues for their support and urge everyone to support this resolution.</paragraph>
