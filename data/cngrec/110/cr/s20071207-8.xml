    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in honor of National Pearl Harbor Remembrance day. Earlier today, my good friend and colleague Senator Inhofe and I introduced a Senate Resolution expressing the sense of the Senate regarding National Pearl Harbor Remembrance day and paying tribute to those servicemembers and civilians who died in the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, as well as the current members of the Pearl Harbor Survivor Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today is the 66th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Memorial ceremonies are taking place at the Naval Station Pearl Harbor to commemorate the 66th anniversary of the attack. Later, the dedication ceremony for the new USS Oklahoma Memorial will also take place on Ford Island at Pearl Harbor. The battleship Oklahoma was anchored along Ford Island on December 7, 1941, and suffered the second greatest loss of life during the attack after the USS Arizona. It is the last  ship to have been destroyed that fateful day to get its own memorial. Clearly, this memorial is long overdue. Prayers, reflections, and tributes will be offered during each of these ceremonies to honor the service and sacrifice of the men and women who fought and died in the defense of our great country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This 66th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor also marks the beginning of a new commemoration for all of our Nation's fallen, called Old Glory's Journey of Remembrance. The journey begins today with Old Glory being flown over the USS Arizona Memorial. The flag will then be taken to, and flown over, 24 other military memorial sites around the country. The journey culminates in observance of the National Moment of Remembrance on Memorial Day at 3 p.m. local time with Old Glory being flown  above the U.S. Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the resolution that I and Senator Inhofe introduced requests that all of my Senate colleagues join together with our fellow Americans in Hawaii and across the Nation to remember and honor the more than 2,400 courageous American sailors, soldiers, and marines who were killed in the raid on Pearl Harbor, as well as to honor those who survived the attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those too young to remember 1941, the attack on Pearl Harbor is something learned in history books. But to those in Hawaii who, like myself, witnessed the attack, the events of December 7 are a painful, vivid memory, and a personal experience that can never be forgotten. While the Japanese surprise attack was a calamity that forever changed the course of history, our country fought back in the name of justice to preserve our Nation's sacred freedoms. I urge the citizens of this Nation to  remember that it was the sacrifices made by ordinary men and women who rallied in defense of freedom, liberty, and the great promise of our democracy that preserved our Nation's freedom and liberty. Their sacrifices represent the greatest heroism and patriotism in the service of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I hope that my Senate colleagues will join me today in prayer and remembrance for those courageous men and women who died in Pearl Harbor on that infamous day.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, every American owes a debt of gratitude to the men and women who lost their lives during the attack on Pearl Harbor. They gave all they had in selfless service to the Nation. We recognize the contributions and sacrifice of the survivors of the attack who went on to secure our freedom and our cherished way of life. In the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges and countless unknowns, they never demanded praise, they never presumed eminence. They taught future generations  the importance of recognizing and remaining vigilant against tyranny in all forms. We also remember the families of the fallen service members. They bore the greatest burden and bravely perpetuated the dignity and the memories of the heroes taken from us on that infamous day.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to speak for a moment in remembrance of the 66th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor and pay tribute to all the Americans who lost their lives that day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 7, 1941, our Nation was brutally attacked at Pearl Harbor, and over 2,400 Americans were killed. Though surprised and overwhelmed by wave after wave of Japanese planes, the members of our armed forces valiantly defended their ships, the naval base and the surrounding army air fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe Pearl Harbor will all always hold a prominent place in the history of the United States, not only for the destruction that day which triggered our entry into the Second World War, but as a shining example of American heroism and courage in the face of adversity. I know Americans will never forget the American servicemen and women who were at Pearl Harbor 66 years ago today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of those servicemen was John Anderson of Roswell, NM. John had only recently been assigned to the USS Arizona along with his twin brother Jake when the Japanese attacked on December 7. Though burned himself, John worked to rescue other survivors from the badly damaged and sinking Arizona until the small boat he and other servicemen were using to pull drowning men from the water of the harbor was also sunk. Terribly, 1,177 sailors from the Arizona, including John's  brother Jake, did not survive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John went on to serve 35 years in the Navy, marry his wife, Karolyn, have three sons and later become the long time weatherman for KBIM-TV in Roswell. I would like to thank John for his brave service and would like to personally honor all the New Mexicans like Jake Anderson who fought and lost their lives that day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pearl Harbor, of course, was just the beginning of several long years of war during which millions of Americans would answer the call of duty. I would like to take this opportunity to mention the service and sacrifice of two such groups of individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of these groups is the Navajo Code Talkers, many of whom were from my home State. The Code Talkers were marines who used their native language to quickly transmit messages  across the battlefields of the Pacific Theater and served in every Marine division from 1942 to the end of the war. Though the Japanese were able to break many American codes during the war, they were never able to decipher the system used by the Code Talkers. Their contribution  to victory cannot be underestimated. There is no doubt that their efforts saved countless American lives, and it has even been said that without the Code Talkers the battle of Iwo Jima could not have been won.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to talk about the soldiers of the 200th and 515th Coastal Artillery units of the New Mexico National Guard, also known as the New Mexico Brigade, who soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor played a prominent and heroic role in the fierce fighting in the Philippines. For 4 months the men of the New Mexico Brigade helped hold off the Japanese only to be defeated by disease, starvation and a lack of ammunition. Sadly, the survivors of the Battle of Bataan from the New Mexico Brigade  were subjected to the horrors and atrocities of the 65 mile "Death March," as well as years of hardship and forced labor in Japanese prisoner of war camps. Tragically, of the 1,800 men of the New Mexico Brigade more than 900 never returned home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I hope New Mexicans will take a moment to honor the individuals who fought so gallantly 66 years ago today as well as all those who served throughout the Second World War, and remember those who paid the ultimate price for our Nation.</paragraph>
