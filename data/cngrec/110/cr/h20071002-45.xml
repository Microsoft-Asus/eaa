    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks in the Record on <bill type="h" number="3571">H.R. 3571</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Office of Compliance is an independent agency that was tasked by Congress to oversee the administration of the Congressional Accountability Act, which provides congressional and legislative branch employees with workplace protections enjoyed by other Federal and private sector workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Being responsible for the oversight of 12 workplace protection, health care, labor and civil rights laws is a huge task that requires a well-seasoned and experienced staff. Unfortunately, when the Congressional Accountability Act was signed into law in 1995, the law barred the Office of Compliance from promoting from within. This lack of flexibility threatens to impact the effectiveness of the office by preventing them from building on the expertise gained by certain personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would lift the current ban on hiring former legislative branch employees within 4 years of their appointment to the Office of Compliance, as well as allowing for the reappointment of executive staff for one additional term. Congress passed legislation during both the 108th Congress and 109th Congress to temporarily address the issue of reappointment. Both pieces of legislation, <bill type="h" number="5122">H.R. 5122</bill> and <bill type="h" number="3071">H.R. 3071</bill>, were noncontroversial and passed both Chambers unanimously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us continue to provide the Office of Compliance with the tools needed to carry out their mandate of ensuring that all of our workers' rights are protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3571">H.R. 3571</bill>, which provides needed flexibility for the Office of Compliance to fill critical positions within the office and to maintain institutional knowledge within the office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Office of Compliance provides an important function in the legislative branch. It is charged with administering and enforcing the Congressional Accountability Act. The act, one of the first considered and passed by the 104th Congress with the new Republican congressional majority, required Congress to comply with the same employment and workplace safety laws that applied to the private sector, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, Occupational Safety and Health Act, and the Family  and Medical Leave Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Current law governing the office places limits on the appointment and tenure of the staff and board. These limits, placed in part to preserve the integrity and independence of the office, have unfortunately resulted in the board's inability to fill vacancies with the best-qualified candidates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, GAO has recommended, and the board agreed, that Congress amend the law to allow for reappointment of board members and staff to an  additional term in the office to maintain institutional continuity and to "prevent the loss of critical organizational knowledge" within the office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is a commonsense adjustment of current law, and I recommend my colleagues support the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brady) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="3571">H.R. 3571</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
