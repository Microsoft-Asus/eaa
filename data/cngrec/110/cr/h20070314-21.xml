    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address Walter Reed and this government's obligation to America's heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday, I toured Walter Reed. My first impression is that one visit is not enough. I will make several more trips to the facility to speak with patients and staff about what they need and how we can best address this unacceptable situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our Nation's finest deserve the finest medical care, plain and simple. This Friday, I will continue my tour of local VA facilities when I visit the James A. Haley VA Hospital in Tampa. This is one of the largest VA facilities in the country, and serves many veterans in my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is not a Democrat or Republican problem, this is America's problem and it requires a bipartisan solution. I urge my colleagues to work together to quickly address and resolve this situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless our troops and veterans. They truly are America's heroes.</paragraph>
