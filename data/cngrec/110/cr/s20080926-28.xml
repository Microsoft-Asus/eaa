  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, at the outset, I wish to thank my distinguished colleague, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for the committee's action in considering the judicial nominees and for moving ahead with their confirmations today. Senator Leahy is used to being generous and statesmanlike, but to confirm all these judges at this time, on September 26, considering the background of the controversies in the Senate, is an act of statesmanship. If they wrote a book "Profiles  in Statesmanship," as well as the book "Profiles in Courage," Senator Leahy would be at the top of the list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been a lot of controversy during the last 2 years of the administration regarding judges. Both Republicans and Democrats have been at fault in the last 2 years of President Reagan's administration, the last 2 years of President George H. W. Bush, the last 2 years of President Clinton, and beyond President Clinton. As I have said on the floor on a number of occasions, I have crossed party lines to support President Clinton's judges because I thought they were inappropriately bottled  up. There is controversy now and we have moved ahead. Senator Leahy has been the leader, the chairman of the committee, to get the job done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are three Pennsylvanians in the group of judges that we are confirming today: C. Darnell Jones, II, president judge of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas; Mitchell Goldberg, judge on the Bucks County Court of Common Pleas; and Joel Slomsky, a distinguished practitioner. Three very distinguished nominees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see the Senator from Colorado is on the floor, and there are two Colorado judges, as well as other judges, that were confirmed. I thank the chairman for his action taken today.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, one, I appreciate his kind words. He and I have been friends from our days when we first met as prosecutors in our jurisdictions. So I appreciate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also appreciate the fact that he has said privately what he has said publicly in thanking me. The Senators from Colorado, the Senators from Florida, and the Senators from Virginia have also joined with the Senators from Pennsylvania in thanking me for moving these nominations. I am sure when the Record is read that Senators from the other States will be aware of what we have done. But I do appreciate that. His words mean a great deal to me.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, a few more concluding comments. I was glad to yield to my distinguished colleague, the chairman of the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also wish to comment briefly about the intellectual property enforcement bill, which is the Leahy-Specter bill. I am glad to see that has cleared and that the holds have been taken off, and I thank Senator Coburn for taking the hold off, after very extensive discussions, which I know the chairman has had and I have had. This is a very important bill for the intellectual property community to provide enforcement and to provide teeth so intellectual property is respected, giving additional  powers to the Department of Justice to see to it that the infringement of intellectual property is acted upon swiftly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see a number of my colleagues waiting to speak, so I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Colorado.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="NOMINATIONS OF CHRISTINE ARGUELLO AND PHILIP BRIMMER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise, first and foremost, to thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Patrick Leahy, for his statesmanship and his hard work and leadership on the Judiciary Committee, as on so many issues. The ten judges that have just been confirmed show the kind of statesmanship he brings to this body, and I am very proud to be able to work with him and proud to be able to work with the distinguished ranking member as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to make a brief comment regarding two of the judges who were confirmed a moment ago, and they would be Christine Arguello and Philip Brimmer from Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Christine Arguello is a person who was nominated by President Clinton, now over 10 years ago, to the district court, as well as the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. She is truly an American dream. She was born and raised in very humble circumstances. There was a poignant time where, because her father worked on the railroad, she actually lived in a boxcar. Yet, over time, she became a very successful student and ended up at Harvard Law School. She went on to have a very distinguished career both  in the private sector and the public sector and served as my chief deputy attorney general during the time I served as the attorney general for the State of Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She is a tenured law professor. She knows the law well, and she will make the State of Colorado and the United States of America very proud with her service on the bench of the U.S. District Court for the State of Colorado. So I congratulate her, and I thank Senator Leahy and Senator Specter for their leadership in moving that through the house.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to congratulate Phil Brimmer, who will join Christine Arguello in the U.S. District Court. He comes from a family of distinguished jurists, and he has a distinguished academic career and now over 7 years of leadership experience within the U.S. Attorney's Office in Colorado, where he has been in charge of the special prosecutions unit. He is a lawyer's lawyer. Both Christine Arguello and Phil Brimmer will move the hands of justice forward in a way we can all be very proud of for the State  of Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see there are two of my colleagues on the floor, Senator Bingaman and Senator Mikulski. I think they are waiting to speak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from New Mexico.</chair>
