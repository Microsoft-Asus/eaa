  <narrative>WELCOMING REV. DANNY DAVIS -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8279]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I too want to say welcome to Dr. Danny Davis for delivering the opening prayer this morning. His son works in the office of Congresswoman THELMA DRAKE. But his church, Mount Hermon Baptist  Church, is located in the Fifth District of Virginia. His predecessor, Dr. Don Davidson, in the last Congress delivered an opening prayer. And Mount Hermon Baptist Church served as the host church for the memorial services of my predecessor  in Congress, the late Dan Daniel, 20 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that the measure passed yesterday for the Commonwealth of Virginia was a hoax and a sham. It provides no funds for the Commonwealth, for its offshore natural gas and its offshore crude oil. I have talked with members of the General Assembly. They will be very reluctant to adopt any drill policy when they are not treated the same as Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. We need to be fair to encourage drilling.</paragraph>
