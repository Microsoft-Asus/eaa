  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize an outstanding small business from my home State of Maine that has established itself as one of New England's leading information technology engineering firms. Headquartered in East Machias, Superlative Technologies Inc., SuprTEK, provides effective information technology solutions and engineering services to the diverse clientele it has established during its 11 years in operation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an 8(a) and HUBZone certified small business, SuprTEK supplies private industries, as well as local, State, and Federal Government, with support solutions in a wide variety of areas, including information assurance, network management, systems development, operation management, wireless solutions, and enterprise architecture. The 8(a) and HUBZone programs often allow small businesses, such as SuprTEK, greater access to Federal Government opportunities. The HUBZone program, in particular, benefits  rural communities by ensuring the business itself, and a portion of its employees, reside in the HUBZone. By enabling each client to utilize its support solutions effectively and efficiently, SuprTEK demonstrates its strong commitment to improving its clients' businesses. Employing highly qualified business and technical specialists averaging almost 10 years of experience, SuprTEK demands high standards for themselves and their clients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SuprTEK has consistently fought to bring jobs and economic vitality to the Machias region and all of downeast Maine. With the closing of the Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station in Cutler, and fears of the loss's effect on the local economy, SuprTEK was awarded a contract to build a first-of-its-kind Navy Human Resources Benefits Call Center in July of 2001. The employees at SuprTEK provided health, insurance, and retirement assistance to nearly 40,000 U.S. Navy civilian employees throughout  the Northeast in 2001. Currently, 30 employees aid the full 186,000 member Navy civilian workforce worldwide. In May 2005, SuprTEK completed the construction of a new and improved facility in East Machias to house its call center. And in October of 2006, the U.S. Navy announced a new contract for SuprTEK's call center to continue providing these vital resources to the Navy through 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, the Army Surface Deployment and Distribution Command presented SuprTEK with its Small Disadvantaged Business Outstanding Achievement Award. This award is emblematic of the U.S. military's appreciation for the work that SuprTEK has done and continues to do. Having visited SuprTEK myself, I have seen firsthand the dedication and commitment of the employees at SuprTEK and the tremendous impact that they are having on the lives of the Navy's civilian employees. Furthermore, SuprTEK plans  to expand its operation by creating a business park that would also include low-cost office space for light industry, such as manufacturers of clothing and household items. This is a welcome and reassuring sign for a region whose prosperity has suffered. I thank everyone at SuprTEK for the magnificent job they have done so far, and wish them luck in their future endeavors.</paragraph>
