  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, William Odom is one of the finest intelligence officers who have served in our military. Retiring at the rank of lieutenant general, his distinguished Army career culminated in his heading up the U.S. Army's intelligence division and the National Security Agency. He has worked tirelessly to help the country understand and deal with the challenges to its security and defense. I have known the general for decades, and, like many of my colleagues, I deeply value his judgment  and insight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I read his opinion piece from last Sunday's Washington Post, "Victory is Not an Option," with great interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Odom lays out the truths and myths of the Nation's involvement in Iraq. Among the clear truths is that the dream of a real democracy gaining roots in that war-torn country is simply that, a dream. He rightly points out, too, that any Iraqi government is likely to be more anti than pro-American at the end of the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As for the myths, he sensibly lays out that it is pure fantasy for anyone to think that our presence is actually preventing the horrible carnage from unfolding or holding Iran back from gaining influence with its neighbor. It is similarly a flight of the imagination to think that our military presence is actually stanching--as opposed to encouraging--al-Qaida's involvement in the country. Finally, it is a myth to think that we must stay in Iraq "to support the troops." In fact, he notes, many  of our brave men and women in the country understand the cold realities that unfold there every day, and many of them believe that we should get out of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Odom makes some sensible suggestions for a new policy direction, something beyond the absurd "surge" that is only the same old repast of stay-the-course with a different seasoning. We should get out of Iraq and recognize that our presence there has become a source of instability for the whole Middle East. He smartly suggests that we should work with our international partners to seek order and stability, which will fundamentally alter the balance against the radicals who want to stir  up even more strife.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that General Odom's article, "Victory Is Not an Option," now be printed in the Record. I urge my colleagues to read this article closely and truly think about what General Odom is saying. The logic is clear and sensible. I think it is incontrovertible.</paragraph>
