    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the energy crisis gripping our country. The time has come for America to unite behind an aggressive campaign to reduce our dependence on foreign energy. Failure to act now will only drive up energy prices and destroy good-paying jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Solving this crisis requires producing more American energy. We must lift the moratorium imposed by Congress on offshore drilling. Also, we must remove the roadblocks preventing leasing programs for oil shale on public lands. Finally, we must allow responsible drilling in ANWR. Doing these things will have an immediate impact on gasoline prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush this week lifted the executive moratorium on new oil and gas exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf. This is an important first step but must be followed by action from Congress to finish the job. Billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas are available to America if we do this. We are the only country in the world not using the energy at its disposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress must act immediately to help lower gasoline prices for all Americans.</paragraph>
