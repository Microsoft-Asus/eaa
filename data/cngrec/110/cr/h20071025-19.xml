"(C) REASONS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE.--The reasons described in this subparagraph for noncompliance with a medical support order with respect to a child are that the child is not being provided health benefits coverage pursuant to such order because--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(i) of failure of the noncustodial parent to comply with the order;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(ii) of the failure of an employer, group health plan or health insurance issuer to comply with such order;

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3963">H.R. 3963</bill>, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this is not a perfect bill, but it is an excellent bipartisan compromise. I would observe that it meets the concerns expressed both in the President's veto message and also in the comments raised by our Republican colleagues as we debated the bill at earlier times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will note that the bill protects health insurance coverage for some 6 million children who now depend on CHIP. I will observe that it provides health coverage for 3.9 million children who are eligible, yet remain uninsured. Together, this is a total of better than 10 million young Americans who, without this legislation, would not have health insurance, and it is to be noted that those same young people will be losing their health insurance shortly if we do not act expeditiously on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>As mentioned, the bill makes changes to accommodate the President's stated concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it terminates the coverage of childless adults in 1 year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, it targets bonus payments only to States that increase enrollments of the poorest uninsured children, and it prohibits States from covering children in families with incomes above $51,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, it contains adequate enforcement to ensure that only U.S. citizens are covered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, it encourages States to help low-income families to secure health insurance provided through their private employer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is focused on the private marketplace. The evidence of that is the bill has strong support from the private health insurance industry. It is supported by the medical community, AMA, children's advocates, educators, advocates for people with disabilities, health professionals, hospitals, the AARP and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is solid, bipartisan legislation worked out in careful meetings with Members from both parties, including Senator Hatch and others on the Senate side who have done such important work on this matter in times past, and that includes also our dear friend, Senator Grassley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is solid, bipartisan legislation that addresses the concerns expressed by the President and by our colleagues in the House on the Republican side. I urge an "aye" vote on <bill type="h" number="3963">H.R. 3963</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today we are dealing with a bill that supposedly is a fix of the previous legislation that has been vetoed. We are all entitled to our opinion, but we should rely on a body that gives us the facts, and that is the Congressional Budget Office. I would like to look at some of those facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, there is supposed to have been a fix on the issue of illegal immigration. CBO still estimates that there will be $3.7 billion of increased Federal spending and complementary State spending that will total some $6.5 billion of additional spending because of this change as it relates to the immigration issue over the next 10 years, and an additional 100,000 adults will gain eligibility because of this section.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The questions that ought to be asked are the two questions that were put to the staff of the Social Security Administration, because if we are going to allow Social Security numbers to be used as identification, these ought to be the questions. They were said to the staff. And the question is: Would the name and Social Security number verification system in this bill verify that the person submitting the name and the Social Security number is who they say they are?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The answer: No.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second question: Would the name and Social Security verification system in this bill prevent an illegal alien  from fraudulently using another person's valid name and matching Social Security number to obtain Medicaid and SCHIP benefits?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The answer: No.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The authors of this bill also claim there is a fix on the issue of adults in SCHIP. The fact that CBO still projects that up to 10 percent of the enrollees in SCHIP will be adults, not children, in the next 5 years, and money for poor children shouldn't, in my opinion, go to cover adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fix on the issue of crowd-out. The CBO still estimates there will be some 2 million people who will lose their private health insurance coverage and become enrolled in a government-run program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then the fix relating to the enrollment of higher income children. CBO estimates there will only be some 800,000 who are currently eligible for SCHIP who will be enrolled in the next 5 years, but an additional 1.1 million people with incomes that are not currently eligible for SCHIP will be enrolled in the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge a "no" vote.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400333" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker and my colleagues, now that the dust has settled and the parliamentary games have been played and some of the facts that have been distorted have been corrected, we reach the point that at the end of the line the question is going to be: Did you vote for health care for 10 million children and did you vote to support the $35 billion that is necessary to do it?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think that any of the families of the children or the Governors or the agencies that are just waiting to see what is going to happen are very interested in the distortions continuing. It is going to be very, very simple. Which way do you vote, and if you did not vote for the bill, why didn't you?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now there may be some particular loyalty to the President, but you have to remember that when these voters and people come to you, the President's veto message will not be stapled to you and you will have to, on your own, be able to explain why you thought what he said was true. That's why we rely heavily on some of the President's strongest supporters, Senator ORRIN HATCH and Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY, because as a Democrat, I am kind of used to Republicans beating up on me, but I  am not used to them beating up on the Republican leaders in the Senate such as ORRIN HATCH and CHUCK GRASSLEY. This is particularly so since the Senate has assumed so much responsibility in putting together this bill which neither you nor I like, but what the heck, we have to play the hand that is dealt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So remember that just by attacking personalities, it may be like getting into a firing squad that is in a circle and we find everybody shooting at each other. But really, the winners and losers are going to be those children without health coverage and their families who are struggling hard. And ultimately, these kids are really America. It takes so much to take care of some of the illnesses that could be detected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as sensitive as the President is to the poor that are smoking and having the tobacco tax increase, tobacco smoking is dangerous for America and for our health system. It is very expensive, and it is a deterrent to children smoking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when all of this is done, I don't know how many people are going to ask you why did you vote no. But please remember that many of the reasons that are stated today, the truth will be caught up to the allegations and you will have to have a better answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I want to thank the distinguished gentleman from Michigan, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell, for requesting unanimous consent that every Member may have 5 days to revise and extend his remarks. The reason I say that is we on the minority side just got this bill at 8 p.m. last night, so it is going to take a few days to understand the changes that have been made, and so we may want to revise and extend our remarks when this debate is over today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the third time we have debated a measure like this along these lines. I am probably going to repeat some of the things I have said earlier because, in our cursory examination of the bill at least, it doesn't appear to have changed very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill does nothing, for example, to address the cliff in the funding of SCHIP, so a future Congress will still face a choice of throwing off the SCHIP rolls 6.5 million kids or raising taxes by about $40 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It still relies on a declining revenue source, tobacco taxes, to fund a growing program which is likely to exacerbate the funding cliff issue. In short, the legislation remains fiscally irresponsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, despite some window dressing on this, it appears illegal immigrants will be able to use fraudulent Social Security numbers and still be able to get SCHIP and Medicaid benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It still allows States to enroll higher income children at least through 2010 and continues to allow States to use a system of so-called income disregards to set just about any income limit they please.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support SCHIP. I want SCHIP to be extended, but this so-called new legislation seems to do absolutely nothing to address the serious flaws in the previous proposals.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400122" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the SCHIP program. The bottom line, my friends, is do we want to fund children's health care for poor children in this country or do we not?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The arguments against it from fiscal conservatives, and I always have to question that a bit because our Republican friends have driven up the deficit to the greatest in American history, and now they want to tell us this program is too expensive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the reasons the American people are so disenchanted with Congress is because the Republicans are blocking a bill that is very, very supportive of what American people want. We see here that 72 percent of the American public, two-thirds of the Senate, the majority of the House, 43 State Governors and more than 300 organizations support this legislation; and our friends on the other side of the aisle are blocking the will of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's fund this bill. Let's help poor children. Stop with the nonsense, stop with the nonsense about New York. We try to help as much as we can. Congress ought to help our poor kids. That's the question. Do you want to help poor kids, or don't you?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I don't think anyone opposes providing health care for poor children and children of the working poor. That is not what our argument is about today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we do oppose is having a bill before us that covers 400,000 less kids in SCHIP than previously. We do oppose having a bill that has a funding cliff in 2012 where you just plan to run out of money. Now the question is: Why would you vote for a bill where you plan on having a program fail?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another thing we see in this bill before us, it is going to spend a half billion dollars more than SCHIP version one, and it is going to cover less kids. So there are plenty of reasons to oppose this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, you have the issue with illegal immigration. CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, projects that section 211 of this bill will result in spending $3.7 billion in increased spending on health care for this population over the next 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then you get to the issue of adults. Well, what you are talking about is getting childless adults off the program, not all adults, just childless adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I think we as parents expect our children to grow up and expect them to take responsibility. This is not Never Never Land, and all adults need to be removed from this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SCHIP, as it was put in place in 1997, is there for poor children, children of the working poor. The list could go on and on. We also know there is a massive redistribution of taxes within this bill. We have all seen those figures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On top of that, you look at what goes to the east coast and it is harming those children in the middle of the country. I oppose the bill.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400387" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman for yielding, and I rise in strong support of this third version of legislation to improve and extend the Children's Health Insurance Program, and I hope the third time will be a charm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eighty percent of Americans, 72 percent perhaps, a strong bipartisan majority in the Senate, nearly every House Democrat, and at last count 45 House Republicans, all supported this version of SCHIP. President Bush and many of my Republican colleagues, however, opposed the previous version of this legislation. Supposedly you opposed it because, one, it might have enabled the States to provide health care to adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Two, children in the middle-income families might get health care. And, three, worst of all, undocumented immigrant children might have gotten health care. Also, there was a concern by some that we'd run out of money. I haven't heard that concern of where we're going to get $1.7 trillion for a war that we're fighting, but at least you're worried about bringing that money to health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today answers those criticisms. It should be more acceptable to a few more of my Republican colleagues, perhaps even to the President. The previous version concerns have been met, rectified, and so those who vote against today's legislation can only be voting against the government providing health care to poor children who have no other means of obtaining medical care. That's the only reason left to vote against this. No other way to account for a "no" vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I'm most proud of what this bill does not do. It doesn't compromise in covering children. It adds $35 billion in new funding to the SCHIP program, and it provides coverage to 10 million additional children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join with me, making the third time a charm, not a strike out, for America's children. With even stronger bipartisan support, we may convince President Bush to do right by America's children. Let's provide him that opportunity and guide him down the path to compassion and humane treatment for all our children.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400206" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to simply state that facts are funny things. No matter what's said on the floor of this House or how many times it's said, facts are facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the real fact is, this compromise bill is nothing less than a bunch of baloney. This bill covers fewer kids, costs more than last week's bogus SCHIP bill, and you know, we have a saying in Texas, if you put lipstick on a pig, it will still be a pig.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My biggest concern with this bill is it doesn't fix the illegal immigration loophole. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the Federal Government will spend almost $4 billion to pay for health insurance benefits for illegal immigrants. That doesn't sound like much of a solution to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this bill diverts resources away from kids who need the resources most. In fact, in 5 years, 10 percent of the enrollees in the Children's Health Insurance Program will not be children but adults. If we're going to reauthorize a Children's Health Insurance Program, we ought to be sure American kids have access to health insurance, not adults, not illegal immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say support poor kids first. The American taxpayer wants, needs, and deserves a bill that does just that.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Dingell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm really pained when I listen to the last speaker and some of the comments that have been made on the other side, you know, calling this sincere effort by the Democrats, on a bipartisan basis with the Senate, to try to come up with something that we can get you on the other side of the aisle to support. You know, I heard words like "baloney" and "bogus," and almost I think actual laughter. And it's a sad day when we laugh at this issue which is an issue of whether we're going to cover kids  so that they don't have to go to an emergency room and can actually go to a doctor and get proper health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats, and this is again bipartisan where some Republicans and the Senate Republicans have gone out of their way to try to address the concerns that some of the Republicans have expressed, but the bottom line is that we can't change the fact that we want to cover additional kids, 10 million in total.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And when we know that the American people support this effort, what they support is covering more kids, those that are already eligible and not enrolled up to the tune of 10 million kids. Now, that's going to take $35 billion over 5 years. You can't get away from it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the President is saying, well, I can't support any new tobacco tax to pay for it; I'm going to pay for it out of the existing budget. Well, that's simply not possible. If you look at the budget, he's actually cutting Medicaid, and one of the things that this bill does is to stop those cuts in Medicaid so we can cover the kids that we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we have tried very hard to address each of the three issues that the Republicans have raised, and the first one I'd like to talk about today is the issue of illegal aliens. There was never anything in this provision that allowed illegal aliens to be covered. We have made it absolutely clear in this new bill that that is the case and that they will not be covered. Anyone who suggests otherwise is just not being honest about this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second thing that we did, we tried to address the issue of adults. Single adults who are phased out after 2 years now under this bill will be phased out after 1 year, and even the parents, yes, they're also phased out I think over two or three years. So we're addressing that issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then the third issue that was raised was the issue with regard to the income eligibility; and here, again, what we're saying is that if you go over 300 percent, okay, other than those that are already grandfathered into the program, you're no longer going to be able to cover those kids at that $82,000 or the other levels that they suggested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we've made an honest effort here to accomplish this, and all we're asking is that a few more of you come over to our side and join the Republicans in the Senate to vote for this legislation. This is an honest way to try to achieve a compromise that will allow us to cover these 10 million children.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It really is a sad day here in the United States Congress. This is an effort in pure politics. If this was an honest effort at compromise, how come nobody ever sat down with the President? How come nobody ever sat down with our leaders?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman just said that they tried to address the issues. Everybody here on the floor knows they didn't address the issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adults remain covered under this legislation, though Republicans said adults shouldn't be covered in the child health care program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And crowd-out, the issue of people losing their private health insurance, causing the private health insurance to go up in cost, was not addressed. The CBO, a nonpartisan body, says 2 million people will lose their private coverage by crowd-out under this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sad thing is, this is pure politics, and it was demonstrated the day that the override attempt failed. Because, on that day, the Republicans had an opportunity to celebrate, having sustained the President's position. But we weren't proud of that moment or of that day because we'd like to deal with the Nation's problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know who applauded on that day? Democrats applauded when the override failed. Why? For political gain, not because they care about insurance or kids or kids' health, but because they want political gain. That's sad; this is a sad day for this Congress.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Now is the time, not tomorrow or next week, now is the time to reauthorize and expand SCHIP, because there's nothing, but nothing, more important than the health of our little children. All of our children, all of the poor children are in the same boat, whether black or white, Hispanic, Asian American or Native American. They need health care to grow strong and survive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We, in Congress, have the best possible health care, and now is the time to deliver that same promise of health to our Nation's children. Suffer the little children. Suffer the little children, all of the children.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I voted to create the children's health care program, and I believe in it. But let's be honest. These changes are more cosmetic than Dr. 90210. This bill still isn't paid for. It still doesn't cover poor kids first, and it still allows abuses like subsidizing adults to continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what's especially sad is that today, while the California tragedy unfolds, most Americans see homes in flames, lives lost, and families huddling in football stadiums as their life's possessions go up in flames, the Washington Democrats see political opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While dedicated California lawmakers rush home to their communities, Democrats rush their bill to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems like none of us in Congress, either party, ought to look like vultures circling above the burned out homes of California families gleefully eyeing a cynical chance to try to pass their partisan legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This proves what we said all along. This isn't about the children. It's about defeating George Bush. Some hate him so badly they will sacrifice whatever morals and integrity to win at all costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats promised to change Washington, but it's business as usual up here; and it's the children who lose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As parents we teach our kids to sit down and work out their differences, that fighting doesn't accomplish anything, that big boys and girls find a way to work together. When this political trick fails, and it will, why don't we apply the same lessons up here and work together to find a reasonable, fiscally responsible way to help cover our kids who need our help?</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400160" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank my Chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us today is not about politics. It's about providing children's health care coverage to 10 million low-income American children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is paid for. It's paid for more than the $190 billion the President's asking for a supplemental to support the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is for the ten million children and parents who are hardworking Americans but cannot afford private health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is clear on undocumented children. No Federal funding will be spent on undocumented immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is clear on childless adults. For 1 year they get coverage, and these adults actually got a waiver, these States got a waiver to cover these adults. So they're going to have 1 year, and then they're off of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is clear on family income. Only the lowest-income children are covered with a prohibition on coverage of children above 300 percent. You can't go above 300 percent. Most are at 200 percent, but some are at 300.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, 4 months of spending in Iraq is enough to provide SCHIP to 10 million children for 5 years. More than 80 percent of the American people support it, and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've prioritized it to the low-income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've prioritized it to citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've prioritized children.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>As the chairman knows we, of course, worked on this together last night on the Rules Committee until late into the night, so I know the chairman and I are both a little under the weather today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, under the changes that have been made in regards to the income disregards in the bill, could a State in its current practice still allow a family to exclude from income $500 a year for child care expenses?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="">
    <paragraph>The answer to the question is yes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400052" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Could a State allow a family to exclude from income $20,000 a year for housing expenses?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Well, it's a "yes" if the State so decides. It's a "no" if they decide not.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="">
    <paragraph>Again, the response is that that is up to the State, and there is nothing in the legislation to preclude that.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400052" topic="">
    <paragraph>So the answer would be a "yes" if to transportation expenses.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, you know and I know that this Congress, this Speaker, is not so insensitive as to allow this health insurance to expire for these children. We will do an extension. We will do what is required to continue to allow coverage for the children until Congress passes the bill; is that not correct?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I am saying to my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, the children of America are listening to us gibe at one another about whether they deserve health care. They deserve health care, and we could give it to them today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They deserve health care because many of them are spending so many hours in an emergency room, costly, many of them are spending times at home when they could be educated. Many parents are not at work because they are staying home with their children. Health care should be a right in America, and our children are saying they would rather see a sermon than to hear one.

  <speaking speaker="400351" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we look at this bill, which we received this morning, it still has the same policy, just a little different cosmetics. I don't think our constituents want us to vote for a bill that makes it easier for illegal immigrants to get tax-paid health care. This bill does that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think our constituents want us to vote for a bill where we spend our constituents's tax dollars to pay for insurance that people already have. This bill does that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think our constituents want us to vote to create a new middle-class entitlement. This does that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also is only one-half paid for. That's right, they only pay for half of this law, and they have an enormous budget gimmick that when you add it all together doubles the cost of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So if the goal here is ultimately to get universal health care so that everybody has insurance, which I think most of us all share, this is not the pathway to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you take a look at what it costs to fund 3.9 million people who are uninsured, that leaves us another 43 million people uninsured. At the spend rate, at the cost of that, if we want to fund everybody, it's another $400 billion. That would add $8 trillion to the debt we have for our kids and our grandkids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By doing it this way, by creating an enormous new entitlement, you are making matters worse for the baby boomers. You are making this enormous cliff we have of entitlement spending that much deeper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there is a better way to getting universal access to affordable health insurance. This is not the way. We believe in patient-centered health care, not government-centered health care. We don't think bureaucrats should be running health care, whether they are an insurance bureaucrat or a government bureaucrat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We think patients and their doctors should be running and making health care decisions. Unfortunately, this bill does not do that. This bill puts the government squarely in the middle and says if you want health care, you got to get it from the government. That's not what we believe in. That's not what we should be doing. That's why we should be voting against this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I submit for the Record the disregards for children's coverage that have been submitted to us by the Congressional Research Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The point here is that the money needs to continue to flow to working families so that we can keep them working rather than staying on welfare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Within the Medicaid and SCHIP programs, states are permitted to disregard or not count certain types of amounts of family income as decided by the State in determining eligibility for the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill maintains this long-standing flexibility to allow States to disregard certain legitimate costs like child care and child support costs, recognizing that this income is not available for a family to spend on health coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Allowing States to disregard these costs ensures that working families have the money they need to pay for work-related expenses to ensure that low-income families can keep their jobs. This is important to keep families from having to go on welfare to get health coverage for their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The following are the monthly disregards applied by States in 2006.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this vote today is about what kind of a country are we. This vote today is about what our priorities are. This vote today is about what our values are. Just the interest rate on funds to pay for the Iraq war are $25 billion a year; yet our President believes that spending $12 billion a year on children's health care is too much. I strongly reject the argument that we are spending too much on our children. Our children deserve better. Our children deserve a healthy start.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard over and over from my constituents about the vital importance of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Nearly 60,000 children in Oregon currently receive health care through SCHIP, and the legislation before the House today will provide for an additional 36,000 children. I know hardworking parents who can't afford health insurance for their children. They don't know what to do. How am I going to cover my kids?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thankfully, today, we are taking strong action to ensure that thousands of fewer working families in Oregon will have to endure the agony of having a sick child for whom they cannot afford medical care.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the American people are clear, they want this Congress and the President to ensure that America's children have access to health coverage. American parents on behalf of the children who get health care coverage under the CHIP program are clear: CHIP is working. Health care under CHIP is affordable and is accessible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have compromised, but we are determined. We are determined to continue and to extend CHIP for America's children, 10 million American children of working families. This bill before us is reasonable, it is smart, and it is responsible. A majority of Congress agrees; yet the President and some in Congress are still unsure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The choice is clear: Vote for health care for America's children or stand in the way. The American people are watching, they are waiting, and maybe, most importantly, they are hoping we will do the right thing and 10 million American children will have access to health coverage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, our Democratic friends claim that they won't consider covering anything less than 10 million children, and yet the Congressional Budget Office shows that their own bill falls short yet again. It also fails to give real priority to poor children. It imposes billions of dollars in new taxes on poor families, and we know that this tax revenue stream won't even cover the expense of the bill in the outyears, and it causes millions to lose private coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, despite warnings from GAO, it also ignores provider access, something that's critical for our children in the SCHIP programs throughout the country. I know in my State of Louisiana we have a serious access problem, despite the fact that we have 106,000 children in the State covered by SCHIP, 6,000 who should be on it not covered, and yet all of them have significant access problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the question, why did our Democratic friends block debate on any amendments that would have addressed these and other concerns? We really shouldn't be playing political games with this. We shouldn't be playing games with children's medical care.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400008" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my dear friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, why would someone not vote for health insurance for 10 million American children? There is the excuse that the bill covers illegal aliens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Read section 605 of the bill; it doesn't. There is the excuse that it covers adults, not children. Read section 112 of the bill, which is called termination of coverage of nonpregnant childless adults. There is the excuse that it covers a lot of wealthy kids, but there is the fact that 91.3 percent of the children covered come from families that make less than $40,000 a year, and the rest live in States that are very, very expensive to live in, like mine in New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then there is the excuse that, well, it's bad for the budget somehow, unlike the $109 billion they want to send to Iraq. But the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that over 10 years this bill saves $200 million for the Federal Treasury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen, no more excuses, vote "yes".</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 1/2  minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to talk about enforcement of this 300 percent above the poverty line. The people that wrote the bill claimed that we have got this hard cap above 300 percent in terms of family income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if you look on page 76 of the bill, the first part of it, starting with line 5, says, "no payment shall be made under this section for any expenditures for providing child health assistance or health benefits coverage for a targeted low-income child whose effective family income would exceed 300 percent of the poverty line."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That sounds okay, but then here is the gotcha, beginning on line 13, "but for the application of a general exclusion of a block of income that is not determined by type of expense or type of income."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So you leave it up to the States to say you can't have an income level over 300 percent, but you can deduct $20,000 for a housing allowance or you can deduct $15,000 for shelter or whatever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So what you've got here is the classic bait and switch. I would say that the majority has listened to some of the concerns of the minority, but you're not really ready to address them substantively. You put the right verbiage in the first paragraph and then you take it away in the second. At some point in time we need to sit down together and really work these things out to make sure that you not only have the verbiage, you also have the enforcement. Now when that day comes, we will have a bipartisan  bill. But that day is not today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a father, it is unfathomable to me why the President chose to deny health care coverage to children. It's incomprehensible to me that some of my colleagues would play politics with a child's health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I always tell my daughter that in life you don't get do-overs. Well, apparently here in Congress you do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President and my colleagues across the aisle have the opportunity that is very rare, and that is to have a second chance to do it right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week I met with pediatricians at a hospital in Port St. Lucie where doctors painted a stark picture of the challenges faced by children without insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I then went across the street to a daycare center and visited children who rely on Florida's CHIP program, KidCare, for the health care needs, kids like 4-year-old Samantha, and 2-year-old Hannah, 4-year-old Rafael and 2-year-old Julian.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President opposes SCHIP because he thinks that children from working families that go to work, pay their taxes but can't afford health insurance shouldn't go to the doctor. He says it's too many kids and too expensive, even though the bill is paid for without putting our country further into debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would ask the President, which child would you deny health care coverage to, Julian or Hannah? Which child is one too many?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to say to my friend from Michigan, the chairman of the committee, that he says that this bill is coming to the floor today because all of the concerns in a letter that were about this bill have been addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, as a physician and a coauthor of that letter, I respectfully disagree. The letter said that SCHIP ought to be reserved for low-income kids first. In fact, what this bill does is provide incentives to ensure higher-income kids before poor kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The letter said that SCHIP ought to be for children only. In fact, CBO estimates that over 700,000 adults will be on the program in 2012, not in 1 year, in 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The letter said that SCHIP ought to cover low-income American children. In fact, the bill weakens both Medicaid and SCHIP citizenship verification, and all with a huge tax increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Members ought to know that there's an alternative. There are multiple alternatives. One of them is <bill type="h" number="3888">H.R. 3888</bill>. It would provide insurance for the same number of kids. It would not move any kids from private personal insurance to government-run insurance. It would make certain that personal choices were respected, and it would not increase taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So why proceed today? Why is the majority party proceeding today? Because it's all about politics. In fact, they've already had their cronies purchase TV and radio ads in the districts of folks that they believe aren't going to support this for political gain. It's all about politics. Not about policy and it certainly isn't about the kids.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on the other side for their weeks of expressing to us what their concerns were about the SCHIP bills that we've passed. And I'm happy to say that we've heard  those concerns, and in this bill that we're voting on today we address those concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They were concerned, as am I, about coverage for illegal immigrants. And this bill expressly prohibits coverage of illegal immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They were concerned about the coverage of adults, including adults who are currently covered in the SCHIP program. This bill eliminates coverage for those adults and all childless adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And they were concerned about income levels. They wanted to keep this program for low-income children, and this bill today caps at 300 percent of poverty the qualification level for families to get into the SCHIP program. So there should be no reason for any of my colleagues on the other side to vote against this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400260" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a husband, as a father, as a former child, I respect very much what we are endeavoring to accomplish today. But we always have to remember that it is not simply enough to do the right thing; we must do the right thing the right way. And again, that is the purpose of this debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much of what we hear outside of these walls tends to mute the serious discussion that we have. I know that following this debate there will be those ads or others that will say that Republicans do not like kids. I assure you, Republicans like kids, and not just medium rare with a side of fries. We do care about the future of children. But it is the comprehensive holistic approach to the care of children which we discuss too little in this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my belief that what we should have done, to truly put poor kids first, was that from the first moments of the first 100 hours this should have been the first bill we could have done. Instead, other bills were passed and billions were spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen appropriation bills come through this Chamber repeatedly where billions are spent, and there was no talk of putting kids first and helping poor kids have health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And now today we reach the point where the only way we can help poor children is to raise taxes on the American people. This is not a prioritization of children and their health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am prepared to accept the majority when they say that they have, the second time around is the charm and they have fixed access of illegals to this program. I am prepared to be concerned about poor kids and kids who are in the margins. But I do ask them to reconsider raising taxes, because we do not want to see one day where our children grow up to be the healthiest people in the unemployment line.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, here we are again. It seems to be just the same act in the same play, the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why are we having this vote today? I really don't know. Many of our Members believe it's because the TV ads, the radio ads have already been bought in their districts, and if they didn't have this vote today somehow that money might be wasted. I don't know that I believe that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of our Members believe we're having the vote on a day when seven Republicans from California can't be here to make our "no" votes on this bill appear to be less than they really are. In fact, I asked that this bill not be voted on today for that reason.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I wonder is why we weren't allowed to see the bill. If this bill is such a great bill, if this bill solved these problems, what would have been the harm of seeing the bill? In fact, a lot of the debate today would have been a different debate if the bill would have been laid down last night and we'd have had the vote next Wednesday or next Thursday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This idea that somehow we have to get it done before November 16 because that's the day that this extension ends doesn't make any sense to anybody. We're going to be here well beyond that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again we go through this process where we're told we've checked the boxes, but then when you look at where the boxes have been checked, they really don't do the job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We ought to get to poor kids first. When we get to kids at 300 percent of the level of poverty, that's 54 percent of all the families in America would have their kids have insurance through the government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've talked to several people in my district that say, I don't mind helping poor kids, but I'm really offended when I'm helping kids whose families make more than I do. I'm really offended as someone who has raised their family when I'm paying taxes to provide insurance for families who make $20,000 more than I do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the Congressional Budget Office believes that the verification standards aren't right yet. I think this is a step in that direction.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we're not having a debate today on whether or not to reauthorize SCHIP. What we're really having a debate about is a tale of two SCHIPs, because it was 10 years ago that Republicans created SCHIP to provide health insurance benefits to uninsured low-income American children. And every Republican stands ready today to reauthorize that program and fund that program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But yet, again, Democrats are coming with their tale of SCHIP, an SCHIP that instead is transforming this program to give additional benefits to adults before children, illegal immigrants before Americans, the insured before the uninsured, and, finally, the higher-income before lower-income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the facts. The program was designed for those up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. The Democrats will increase it explicitly up to 300 percent; but with all their loopholes, even wealthier families will qualify, shortchanging low-income, uninsured American children to subsidize higher-income families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the program was designed for children, 13 States insure adults. Three cover more adults than children. Democrats continue this practice, shortchanging low-income, uninsured American children in order to subsidize adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the program was designed for the Americans, the Democrats still strip out proof of citizenship measures. Democrats shortchange low-income, uninsured American children in order to subsidize illegal immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the program was designed to help the uninsured, CBO reports that the plan will, in effect, take 2 million off of private health insurance. Democrats shortchange low-income, uninsured American children in order to subsidize the already insured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's put the children first and the politics second. Let's reject this bill, and let's reauthorize the real SCHIP program for our children.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, at this time I yield myself 2 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, both in terms of its scope, expanding a low-income children's program to cover adults and middle-class families, and cost, $35 billion in new taxes and spending, remains unacceptable. And it's truly unfortunate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This House, this Congress, and this President support SCHIP. The failure to form a bipartisan compromise to provide low-income American children with health insurance is nothing short of a failure of the majority's leadership. The minor changes, tinkering, clarifications we see today do not a compromise make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Compromise, by definition, is a settlement of differences in which each side makes concessions. The previous bill doubled the cost of this program, and this bill costs a half billion more beyond that than the last one. The majority has not made one concession in this cosmetic re-draft. It's the same  bill with the same objections, and we should not compromise our principles to satisfy their political aims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we have before us is a bill that continues to allow Federal resources, 10 percent or more, to be diverted away from low-income children and given to adults, a bill that provides a back door to illegal immigrants to get Federal benefits to the tune of $3.7 billion, and a bill that continues to force at least 2 million families out of their current plan and into a government program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>While Southern California has burned, the Speaker has this House fiddling and posturing. Worse yet, the majority is manipulating that tragedy and is tying this vote to ensure our votes are reduced. It's as crass a tactic as I have seen in my time in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is past time for the game to end, and it is past time for the majority to engage in a serious negotiation with us on how to renew and improve this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to again vote "no" and again send a message that low-income children's health insurance is not an issue to be politicized. We can do better than this.</paragraph>

And it specifically says under current law individuals who apply for Medicaid and claim to be U.S. citizens are required to provide certain documents, passport or birth certificate, in order to receive any such health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Section 211 would allow States the option to either use the requirements created in the DRA for citizenship documentation under Medicaid or instead verify an individual's name and Social Security number with the Social Security Administration. Some States have reported a drop in enrollment since implementation of the DRA because some Medicaid applicants have had difficulty satisfying the documentation requirement. Available evidence, based on State reports and other information provided by  State officials, suggests that virtually all of those who have been unable to provide the required documentation are U.S. citizens."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: As you requested, I am providing additional information on CBO's estimate of the budgetary impact of section 211 of <bill type="h" number="3963">H.R. 3963</bill>, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, as introduced on October 24, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under current law, individuals who apply for Medicaid and claim to be U.S. citizens are required to provide certain documents (such as a passport or birth certificate, and, in certain circumstances, a driver's license or other documentation that establishes identity) to demonstrate that they are citizens. That provision was enacted in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, Public Law 109-171), and has been effective since July 1, 2006. (Before the DRA provision took effect, those individuals  were permitted to attest to their citizenship, under penalty of perjury.)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 211 would allow states the option to either use the requirements created in the DRA for citizenship documentation under Medicaid or instead verify an individual's name and Social Security number with the Social Security Administration. Some states have reported a drop in enrollment since implementation of the DRA because some Medicaid applicants have had difficulty satisfying the documentation requirement. Available evidence, based on state reports and other information provided by state  officials, suggests that virtually all of those who have been unable to provide the required documentation are U.S. citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under <bill type="h" number="3963">H.R. 3963</bill>, CBO expects that most states would use the option to rely on the Social Security Administration to verify eligibility. CBO estimates that change would result in an additional 500,000 enrollees in Medicaid in fiscal year 2008 and an additional 200,000 enrollees in subsequent years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Matt Kapuscinski and Eric Rollins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peter R. Orszag,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, at this time I am honored to yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Pomeroy).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400323" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I got to be a father late in life so that now I have got an 11-year-old and a 14-year-old at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And last winter I had a real long, miserable, anxious weekend, one that any parent probably has experienced. I had a sick kid and I didn't know what to do. A fever higher than I was comfortable with. The disposition of my little fellow, very different than usual. And in the end, we sought some medical care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have spent a lot of time thinking about that weekend as we have thought about this SCHIP because there are families with sick young'uns and they don't know what to do, but they cannot afford medical care. They don't have coverage. They don't have Medicaid for the poorest of the poor. But by virtue of working in a place that doesn't provide employer-provided health insurance, by virtue of earning an income that doesn't let them afford it, they're uncovered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What do you do? The cost of one trip to an emergency room is a month's rent. What do you do? You pray and you hope that the little one gets better. And, fortunately, they often do. But, tragically, they sometimes don't. So when that long-delayed trip to the doctor or the hospital occurs, we have got a runaway health issue that the parent has had to sit and watch develop, all the while trying to figure out how to handle this situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can make this problem go away for 10 million children by moving this legislation forward. To me, this isn't a Democrat, this isn't a Republican matter. This is a matter of basic morality. Are we going to help families get access to medical care by getting insurance coverage for their kids so they don't have to pick between bankruptcy  and trying to address their kids' medical problem in a more timely way? It's as simple as that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gosh, the rhetoric has gotten so heated, this and that, one charge or another. But what we have tried to do is take many of the issues that were offered in support of sustaining the veto of the President stopping this insurance coverage for children from taking place. We tried to address it in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They said families earning $83,000 can get this kind of coverage. It wasn't true, but we have taken steps in this bill to make absolutely certain it couldn't happen under any circumstances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They said parents are getting coverage. Well, there are a few isolated examples of where grandfathered programs allowed that, but we have phased that out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have listened and we have responded, and it's time for this side to take "yes" for an answer because there is something that has got to rise above the daily squabbling in this place, and that is responding to the needs of families to get their kids the health care they need. Vote "yes" on this bill.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Mr. BARTON of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I'm reminded of a homeowner who is getting ready to sell their home. It's a little older shop and it's shopworn and has not seen its best day. So they have a building inspector come out to inspect the home before they put it up for market. And the inspector gives the report, and the inspector says, "You've got some major termite damage in the walls, and I think you need to really rebuild the walls."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the homeowner says, "We'll paint over it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He says, "Your plumbing is all rusted out. I think you really need to replace the plumbing."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the homeowner says, "We'll paint over it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then he says, "I think your insulation and your electrical system's very frayed and you need to replace it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the homeowner says, "Well, we'll paint over it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we have here today is basically the same bill that we had last week where we sustained the President's veto. Our friends on the majority side of the aisle have just painted over it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, they are saying the right rhetorical things. They're saying that nobody above 300 percent of poverty is going to get a benefit, but they then disregard the enforcement mechanisms that would enforce that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They say in section 605 that no illegal alien is going to get a benefit, but then they change the enforcement mechanisms so that if somebody has a Social Security card and a name to it, that's all they have to do to prove citizenship, and the Social Security Administration, rightfully so, says that is really not a proof of citizenship if you are able to get a Social Security card.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And they claim that they're going to take the adults off the program within a year, but according to the CBO, at least a half million adults are still going to be on the program in 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it's the same bill with a little bit different paint. In Texas we have a saying, "You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is a pig. It may be a good pig. It may be a nice pig. It may be intended to be the right kind of pig. But it's still a pig.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vote "no" on the bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, at this time I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, my friend (Mr. Pallone).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I continue to be upset by the Republican characterizations of this bill as a "pig" or the effort to trivialize what we do here today. I think it's very unfortunate we have gotten to that point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There have been a lot of distortions on the other side from the Republicans. But the one that I have to correct today is the continued mention of the fact that this bill is not going to cover 10 million children or that somehow the CBO has said it's not 10 million but it's 7.4 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What they have neglected to point out is that the difference are the kids that we are going to enroll under Medicaid, and CBO has emphasized that over and over again. There are 7.4 million covered by SCHIP, but the addition up to the 10 is essentially covered by Medicaid. And those are the lowest income kids of all. This bill does the best job of making sure that those low-income children who are eligible for Medicaid and not enrolled would, in fact, get insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republicans continue to forget and eliminate the fact that this bill also addresses the Medicaid program. There are a lot of kids at the very lowest end, less than 100 percent of poverty, who are not enrolled in Medicaid because there hasn't been the proper outreach to get them enrolled. So what we are doing here is providing for that outreach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So don't tell me we're not covering 10 million children. We are. And the ones you are not mentioning are the lowest income of all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then I heard my colleagues talk about the illegal aliens again. Once again, we have put in provisions here that you have to verify whether it's through the Social Security Administration or it's through documentation. Now, there is probably some person to come and misrepresent who they are. But the fact of the matter is that the CBO says in that letter that was introduced by the gentlewoman from Ohio into the Record that virtually no one that's on this program is an illegal alien.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact of the matter is that the Republicans continue these distortions. There are no illegal aliens. There are 10 million children covered.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, to close the debate on the minority side, I'm very pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished minority leader from the great State of Ohio (Mr. Boehner).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400036" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleague for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker and my colleagues, if you feel as though we've been here before, it's because we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, we had a vote to override the President's veto. The votes were here to sustain the President's veto. I said during that debate that Republicans and Democrats had created this program together; Republicans and Democrats want to reauthorize this program together. The issues that separate us are not that great; we can sit down and resolve those issues. That has not happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As has been pointed out during this debate today, there are differences. There were some attempts to address those differences; but by and large most of them, as my colleague from Texas pointed out, were just painted over, little tweaks with words here and little tweaks with words there. And you've already heard about the deficiencies in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that's not why I rise. Why I rise is because this doesn't have to be this way. There is no reason why we, on both sides of the aisle, can't come together and resolve the few differences we have in this bill that are well known now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is not being brought up today in a rush, delivered by 7:30 last night, a 293-page bill with all kinds of changes in it. We're not debating this bill today to pass it. We're debating this bill again today to play another political game. You know it; I know it. I sat with the majority leader yesterday, along with the minority whip, to say, Mr. Majority Leader, we can resolve these differences. We can fix this and we can reauthorize this program. We were turned down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairman of the Democrat Caucus stopped my staffer and said, We don't care whether you'll give us the votes to pass this or not because if you don't, we'll just pull this bill and we'll wrap it around your necks in the next election. Political games, political games, political games. Exactly what the American public are sick of, and you all know it. Everyone knows this is nothing more than a political game, trying to score political points, getting ready for the next legislation. I thought  the American people sent us here to deal with their problems. I think they sent us here to work together to deal with their problems in a way that we can be proud of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nothing has happened this year in this Congress. You think about it. Step back over the course of this year, nothing has happened yet. And let me tell  you, we've got another 14 months left in this Congress and nothing is going to happen. Why? Because all the majority wants to do is play political games and not reach across the aisle and get things done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My promised accomplishments over the 17 years that I've been here, three big legislative projects that I've worked on, were all done in a bipartisan manner. Members from both sides of the aisle that played a significant role in coming together, dealing with issues like education reform, dealing with issues like financial services modernization, dealing with issues like the Pension Protection Act that we did last year, we did it together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And when you think about the little bit of differences in this bill, you begin to wonder once again why Congress' approval rating is at a dismal 10 or 15 percent. Why? Because people are tired of watching this process not work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is not going to become law. The votes are there to sustain the President's veto; the President has made it clear he is going to veto it. How long are we going to play the games before we get serious about resolving our differences?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a sad day. And I think a lot of my friends on both sides of the aisle realize this is a sad day when we can't come together and deal with the issues the American people want us to deal with and deal with them like adults, adults that are willing to sit down and work together and to resolve those differences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I say to my colleagues, even those of my colleagues who voted for this, if you're tired of the political games, if you're tired of Congress' approval rating being at these ridiculous levels, let's all just vote "no." Let's vote "no" and stop this bill. And then we can sit down and resolve the differences we have, and we can do it in a bipartisan manner and show the American people that we can, in fact, work together on their behalf.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois, an outstanding member of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rahm Emanuel.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400120" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I helped negotiate the original SCHIP when I worked for President Clinton. It was President Clinton who proposed the SCHIP bill, not the Republicans; in fact, they opposed it. Then they agreed, after the Balanced Budget Agreement, that we would have pediatric care, eye and dental; but it was President Clinton that demanded it and made it a precondition before any agreement on the Balanced Budget Agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I believe the sincerity that my colleagues support this, and I believe the sincerity of what they said in their letter, which is why we answered every one of those questions, both the sincerity in supporting it, and the sincerity of those remarks. At some point, you have to understand that you can take yes for an answer, and that is, we have provided that answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second is, Dolores Sweeney lives in my district. She works for an insurance company. Dolores Sweeney has three kids. Her insurance company does not provide her or her kids health care. She does right by her kids; she earns a paycheck, not a welfare check. If her kids got sick, she would go to Medicaid and go to welfare, but she's doing right by her children because she's working and teaching them right from wrong. Her kids are in SCHIP. And without this program, her kids will live one illness  away from Medicaid. Medicaid is for them, for the poor. SCHIP is for parents who work full time earning a paycheck, not a welfare check. They're doing right by their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I believe in the sincerity of your position, which is why we answered that in the last two weeks. This vote is to say whether 10 million children will get the health care they deserve, whose parents work full-time. These are parents who are doing right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the President at one time referred to SCHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, as excessive spending; yet this week he submitted a request for $200 billion more for Iraq. These kids are our future. Iraq is stealing our future from America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield to my distinguished friend, the majority leader, the balance of my time for purposes of closing.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good day. This is a good day because we have another opportunity to extend to children, 4 million of whom are not covered by health insurance, coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know how many families that is, but it's obviously millions of families who will have the confidence that if their child gets sick, they will have insurance. They can access health care. They can try to make their children well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to refer briefly to my friend Mr. Boehner's comments because I agree with him that the American public expected us to come here and work together. But let us review this legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, we had committee hearings. I want to tell my friend from Texas, those committee hearings were difficult. We didn't really get to the committee hearings and committee markups that we wanted to have. I think that's unfortunate. That was not our fault, I suggest to you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, let me say that we passed a major bill through this House, approximately $90 billion. It dealt with a number of subjects, including doctor reimbursements so that they would continue to serve those who are poor under Medicaid and, indeed, under Medicare, so the reimbursement levels under Medicare would be appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We dealt with rural hospitals so that they would be reimbursed at levels that allowed them to continue to serve our rural communities. We dealt with some other issues. And, yes, we dealt with children's health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That bill went to the Senate. And there were a lot of Members of your party who didn't like the expansive bill. But before it got there, you offered a motion to recommit on our bill. You cut our spending cuts, you did not agree with those, but you adopted the revenues from the tax increase in cigarettes in your motion to recommit. Most of you, perhaps not all, but most of you voted for that motion to recommit. So this funding source is one that we have agreed to and everybody has voted for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it got to the Senate, we made a tremendous compromise. And we went from a $90 billion bill covering rural hospitals and doctors' reimbursement and poor people who would have been marginalized, perhaps, by the cuts to Medicare Advantage. And we made a compromise, mainly with Republicans in the Senate who felt that they wanted a more restricted bill. So that bill that is confronting us now is now a $35 billion bill, a very substantial compromise, I will suggest to you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That bill then passed the Senate, went to the President, he vetoed it, it came back here, and you made a determination, some of you, not to vote to override the President's veto. So those 4 million children don't yet have a health insurance bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then 38 of you wrote to the Speaker and said that you wanted to see certain changes. We addressed that. We addressed it very substantively, we addressed it very carefully, and we addressed it in a bipartisan way. And because this bill has to go through the Senate, we then engaged Senator Hatch and Senator Grassley so that it would not be simply Democrats saying, well, we'll take this and not that. And it was a very considered judgment applied, and almost all of the points raised  in that letter were addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I had the opportunity this morning to meet with, not all 38, but the majority of those 38. Obviously they were correct that there was not more time to discuss this. I think that was a fair analysis. But the fact of the matter is that careful attention and compromise was taken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Boehner is correct, I met with Mr. Boehner and Mr. Blunt. We have a good relationship; we have the ability to talk. But I will tell you that one of the indications I had was that those changes would not affect at least one of those votes because, philosophically, that leader is not for this bill. I understand that, that's a fair position to take. We're for this bill. We want to see this bill go forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I will say to my friends on this side of the aisle, on the Republican side of the aisle, I want to continue to work with those who really want to see, as that letter of 38 said, reauthorization effected because that's what we want to see. And we will continue to work  with you. This bill will go to the Senate; it will be considered there in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have significant, concrete changes to the legislation vetoed by President Bush, changes that are designed to address the concerns expressed by the President and by a number of Republican Members. We listened carefully to the criticisms of the vetoed bill. We reviewed the letter, as I've said, that the 38 Republicans sent to the President, as well as other letters that were distributed. I misspoke, I said it was sent to the Speaker. I observe only that apparently you wanted to negotiate with  the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also worked closely with Senators Grassley and Hatch, who met extensively with House Republicans. The bottom line is this: we have taken a bipartisan compromise that was strongly supported by the American people and by the overwhelming Members of both Houses of the Congress of the United States and worked to make it an even stronger bipartisan compromise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, this legislation clarifies that it targets low-income children. That was one of the concerns. The compromises we have reached in the legislative language appended to the legislation today do, in fact, accomplish that objective. Prohibiting CHIP coverage above 300 percent of the Federal poverty level that the President talked a lot about, talked about the 83,000, we have prevented that. We said that is not going to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>It clarifies that illegal immigrants are not eligible for coverage under CHIP. I have not reviewed the prescription drug bill that you passed, but the legislation, I think, in this bill is stronger on that issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It clarifies that this bill is focused on children. That was a legitimate objection raised on your side of the aisle. We took that into consideration because we believed it was something we should respond to because that was our intent, to focus on children. As a result, we have phased out coverage for childless adults over 1 year, not 2. Some said that this is just tweaking. To have the time of phaseout, it seems to me, is a very significant change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, it clarifies that this bill seeks to minimize the number of children moving from private insurance to CHIP, "crowd-out," requiring all States to develop plans and implement recommended best practices for minimizing so-called "crowd-out."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We think we tried to respond, and we did respond, we believe, to the concerns you raised. These are significant, concrete changes, changes that neither affect nor undermine our principal objective and commitment: to ensure that 10 million American children from low-income working families who are eligible for coverage under CHIP guidelines today can participate in this successful program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, again, remind my colleagues that this indeed was the stated objective of the President of the United States, when, at the Republican National Convention in 2004, he promised, in seeking reelection by the American public, he promised this: "In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions," with an S, "millions of children who are eligible but not signed up for government health insurance programs." He went on to say this: "We will not allow a lack of attention, or information,  to stand between these children and the health care they need."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, what stands between the children and the health care they need is the President's veto. We continue to try to achieve the President's expressed objective. I urge my colleagues, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Mr. Boehner is correct. This is not a partisan issue. There is not a Member on your side of the aisle that doesn't care about our children. There is not a Member on our side of the aisle that doesn't care about our children. We have an opportunity  to add 4 million children to the health coverage of our country, just as the President said he wanted to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge you to stand with the bipartisan majorities in Congress, including 45 House Republicans and 18 Senate Republicans who voted for the first CHIP bill. This bill, in some ways, in my opinion, is a better bill for the suggestions made from your side of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stand with the States' Governors, the American Medical Association, the Association of Health Insurance Plans, the pharmaceutical companies, nurses, children's advocates and others who support this bill. Stand with the American people, 81 percent of whom support this legislation. Stand with the 10 million American children who will receive the health coverage they need and deserve under this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan compromise addresses your concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us give "yes" for an answer to America's children. Vote for this bill. It is good for America. It is good for our children.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400217" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today, Congress, once again, wrote a prescription to the President for American children and their families that needs to be filled immediately. I am proud of the fact that Congress has sent to the Senate, and will soon send to the President, an insurance remedy for so many working families. I strongly support <bill type="h" number="3963">H.R. 3963</bill>, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, the modified bill to reauthorize and expand the State Children's Health Insurance  Program or SCHIP. Working with the Minority, we were able to quickly craft a bill that addresses the concerns of most, if not all, Members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the wealthiest country in the world, far too many children are without health insurance. We can afford to spend $10 billion per month in a war in Iraq, but we cannot spend $35 billion over 5 years to protect our children? We cannot support those working families who cannot afford or do not have access to affordable health insurance? Over 81 percent of Americans, when asked this very question, agree with the Democratic Party that we need to take care of our children, and we need to take care  of them now. Since the inception of SCHIP, the number of uninsured children has been reduced by one third. However, millions of children still remain uninsured or underinsured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The revised bill before Congress today still would expand SCHIP to cover 10 million children and increase spending on the program to $35 billion over 5 years, funded with a 61 cent per pack increase in the federal cigarette tax. The bill would limit coverage to children in families with annual incomes below 300 percent of the federal poverty level, and performance bonuses would be offered to states that enroll greater numbers of children in Medicaid. The bill also would offer performance bonuses  to states that provide subsidies to employed parents to offset the cost of enrolling their children in a private health insurance plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passing this legislation should be a bipartisan issue. SCHIP was created to address the growing problem of children in the United States without health insurance. SCHIP assists children whose family's income falls above the threshold for Medicaid, but who still cannot afford to purchase medical insurance coverage. More than two thirds of the children who will be covered under this bill are ethnic minorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lack of medical insurance not only harms children, but their families and the community as a whole. Reauthorizing this bill is so important because children without health insurance do not receive regular checkups and doctor visits that every child needs. May I remind my colleagues that less than 10 miles from where we vote, a little boy died from the lack of getting a simple dental examination. Furthermore, millions of children won't get the preventive care they need and will likely receive  care in emergency rooms if this bill is not reauthorized. This only drives up the cost of medical care for everyone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SCHIP gives working families the peace of mind that their children will have accessible and affordable health care. Healthy children do not get unnecessary diseases and go to school ready to learn. Healthy children become healthy teenagers, who ultimately will become healthy adults. Although children are about 30 percent of our population, they are 100 percent of our future. This $35 billion is a wise investment in the future of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Bible, in the chapter of Isaiah, it says that "the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fatted domestic animal together; and a little child shall lead them." Today, Congress worked together to stand up for the children of our Nation. The President, and Congress, ignored the wisdom in protecting our children one time too many; it is now time to erase that mistake. We have that opportunity now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SCHIP is a smart investment in our Nation's children and working families. Congress has changed the course of the discussion of health care for our children and working families; we have confronted the crises of the lack of health insurance; we will continue the legacy of caring for some of the least of our brothers and sisters. I look forward to quick passage of this bill in the Senate, and the President's enacting this bill into law. Our children deserve no less.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412201" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, for the third time this Congress, the House of Representatives  is again addressing the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP. For the third time, this House is considering a bill that would move millions of children away from private health insurance into government-run health care, substantially raise taxes, and dramatically increase federal spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently the President vetoed an SCHIP bill precisely because of these concerns. Yet here we are today with a bill that is remarkably similar. I am afraid that this Congress is not serious in addressing America's health care challenges, particularly health care for America's children. The majority purports that this bill is "for the children." That phrase--"for the children"--is used like a club by our friends across the aisle whenever they want to pass bad bills. If we really care about  children, we won't pass legislation that takes a giant step toward government-run health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That said, Madam Speaker, I am interested in more than this bill's title or good intentions. The success or failure of all legislation must be judged not by its intentions, but how it will affect real people, real families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this bill is not the right policy for our children. Government health care is the most expensive and least efficient health care you can get. And that's exactly what this bill will produce. The Congressional Budget Office states that 2 million people actually will lose their private health insurance coverage and become enrolled in a government-run program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill explodes funding for SCHIP above current law by $35.4 billion over 5 years and $71.5 billion over 10 years. The majority claims to fund this by raising taxes on tobacco products, yet the irony is that 22 million more smokers will be needed in just the next 5 years to fund the SCHIP bill we're considering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me get this straight: We want healthy children and cancerous adults. I'm pretty new here in Congress, but even for a new kid on the Congressional block that doesn't seem to add up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is not about poor children. The bill defines the poverty level to qualify for SCHIP at 300 percent, which is around $62,000 for a family of four. That's $16,000 more than the median income in my home state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, loopholes will allow states to define this poverty level and employ "income disregards," thereby allowing families with even higher incomes to qualify for this expensive program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ostensibly "for the children," this bill actually would increase the number of adults on SCHIP. The CBO projects that over 700,000 adults may be enrolled in SCHIP in FY2012. Shouldn't we be working to move people off of government health care and into private-sector care that works much better? We say we're for personal responsibility, free markets and red tape, yet this bill would create dependency, bigger government and more bureaucracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this bill substantially weakens the citizenship requirements to qualify for SCHIP, inviting fraud and abuse of this program by illegal aliens. The CBO projects that this fiscal disaster could cost the taxpayer around $3.7 billion in increased federal spending over the next 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also changes the period of time a state has to spend its SCHIP allotment from 3 years to 2 years. This will significantly increase the strain on state budgets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This proposal is not about good intentions, soothing sentiments, or warm feelings. It's about real people, real taxpayers, and real, quality, affordable and accessible health care. It fails miserably in every category.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "no" on this fatally flawed bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today the House votes yet again on legislation that never should have been a subject of controversy: a bill that provides health care for our Nation's children. When we debated overriding the President's veto of the original SCHIP bill last week, most House Republicans offered excuses for denying children health care based on a series of misrepresentations and distortions of the facts. Today the bill's opponents have no more excuses to hide behind. We have consulted  with Republicans who want to support this bill and have amended it to address their concerns. It should now be clear to all that the real reason some continue to oppose SCHIP is because they oppose universal health care for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans voting no on last week's veto override offered four reasons for their unwillingness to support health coverage for America's children. These concerns had, in fact, already been addressed in the original bill, but now we have dealt with them even more explicitly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans argued that the bill did not focus enough on covering poor children. I find this particular objection rather ironic, since the same Republicans who used this argument rarely support legislation designed to help the poor. But, it is not surprising that they would use disingenuous tactics to block health care for children. For them, anything goes when it comes to stopping Americans from getting the radical idea that the government should guarantee this basic human right. This revised  bill addresses those arguments by mandating that SCHIP eligibility will be capped at families earning 300 percent of the federal poverty level, around $60,000 for a family of four, and by offering bonus payments to States for enrolling the lowest income children into Medicaid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opponents of health care for children contended that the original bill provided coverage to illegal immigrants. In reality, this bill denied coverage to all immigrants, even legal ones, explicitly stating that illegal immigrants were ineligible. But these facts did not hinder the Republicans from making their false claim. We have now clarified our intent that illegal immigrants will not be covered by requiring that applicants for SCHIP provide their Social Security number, which must be verified  by the Social Security Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans opposed the original bill because it allowed States to use the funding to cover adults. For them, a person's right to health care ends at age 18. I would disagree, but in any case this bill now phases out any adults covered under SCHIP over a 1-year period, instead of the 2-year period under the original bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, further changes have been made to clarify that this legislation is designed to minimize children moving from private insurance to SCHIP, also known as "crowd-out." I am a critic of private health insurance, with its costly and unnecessary administrative, waste, advertising and profits, but this bill should allay any concern that a government health plan, with its much lower overhead costs and more comprehensive coverage, would diminish the role of private insurance companies. We will  actually allow States to subsidize people to buy private coverage under this bill to prevent them from moving to government coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President and his supporters are now left with only one argument for opposing this bill: that it costs too much. The original House-passed version authorized an additional $50 billion for SCHIP over 5 years; our compromise with the Senate brought the total down to $35 billion. This additional funding will ensure that SCHIP will cover 10 million children who otherwise would not have access to health care. The President began this debate by offering to add only $5 billion, which would have  resulted in 800,000 children currently covered by SCHIP losing their coverage. He is now saying that he's willing to go to up to $20 billion, but no more. I would like the President to explain to the American people how he can afford $12 billion for a single month in Iraq but can't seem to find $35 billion over 5 years to give our children health care. Supporters of the contention that we can't afford this bill either care more about war than children, or are simply not serious.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now that the Republicans' stated reasons for opposing this legislation have been addressed, one wonders what is actually motivating those who will continue to vote no. I believe that the President and his supporters continue to oppose this legislation because they are afraid. They are afraid of SCHIP because it demonstrates that health care guaranteed by the government is workable, it is affordable, and it is popular. They worry that if SCHIP is expanded, even more Americans will begin to demand  that the government guarantee health care to all our citizens, not just to poor children. After all, every other industrialized nation does so, while spending less than we do and while achieving better health outcomes for its citizens. These Republicans apparently intend to use every means at their disposal to ensure that health care in this country remains a privilege for those who can afford it, rather than a right guaranteed to all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today's vote raises a moral question. Simply put: will we, as a nation, take responsibility for ensuring that our children have the health care they need? Any other issue raised in this debate, particularly given the revisions to the bill, is an obfuscation meant to hide the fact that the party claiming the mantle of "family values" is in fact unwilling to back that slogan with substance. There is only one vote today that truly supports America's families. It is a vote in favor  of this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the bill to continue and expand the Children's Health Insurance Program that is on the floor today and to urge every member of this body to vote for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly there is no better investment that we can make than in our children, and this bill does so by ensuring that an additional almost 4 million children will have access to comprehensive health care--care that includes dental care and other important services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while many of us would have wished to cover every single child who currently lives without health insurance without regard to legality of their presence in this country, we are happy that at least all who are legally here have the opportunity for coverage. I am also disappointed that the Territories will not get full  state-like treatment, but there are improvements for us as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a big step forward for our country, which continues to lag behind every other industrialized country in the quality of its people's health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And every penny that is spent on increasing access to care when needed, on providing preventive care and early care will save this country many more billions, and has the potential to help reduce health care costs and save Medicare into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as we move to keep our promise to America's children, I only hope that we can continue on this road to invest in the health and health care of minority and rural populations. I only hope that we stand together to close the gaps in our health care system and reduce the racial and ethnic, as well as geographic and gender differences in health status because certainly providing preventive, early and culturally competent care to these will pay further dividends, further reduce the  cost of health care and make this a better and stronger country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of our Nation's children's health and health care; I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of expanding and strengthening the Children's Health Insurance Program. Today is the day for us to stop talking about doing better; today is the day to actually start doing better, and, the children shall lead the way.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400124" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this children's health insurance bill, and I'm proud to be a cosponsor of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is the result of a great deal of work to meet concerns of colleagues in the minority. We want them to join us in voting for it in order to override a presidential veto and finally enroll 10 million children in the State Children's Health Insurance Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill makes it legislatively clear that no adults will be covered--only children are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill makes it legislatively clear that non-citizens will not be covered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill makes it legislatively clear that only low-income children will be covered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill makes it legislatively clear that no one earning $83,000 a year will receive coverage under this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we've addressed every significant objection to this bill, we have not compromised on the number of children covered. Our goal has been to cover ten million low-income, uninsured children and we do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Virtually everyone with a stake in public health and healthcare is calling for this bill to be passed. There are 270 groups supporting this bill: 43 Republican and Democratic governors; the American Medical Association; AARP; America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP); the Healthcare Leadership Council; and Catholic Charities, among others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an extraordinary investment in our children and our collective future. I urge every Member of the House to vote for it, and when we do it, it will be a major victory for the little ones in our country.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400179" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the reauthorization of the State Children Health Insurance Program. In the decade since its enactment, the SCHIP block grant program has exceeded expectations by providing quality health care to millions of American children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my state of Texas, over 20 percent of all children--that's approximately 1.4 million kids--are not covered by health insurance today. This means that 1.4 million young Texans have no access to adequate medical care and are not receiving the preventive or primary care they need to lead productive lives. This is a moral travesty and an unacceptable failure of our Nation's leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SCHIP program invests in our children and our future. Without adequate health care, our efforts to improve our educational and child care systems are less effective. Should our children not begin their lives in good health, they will surely be hampered by increasing medical problems as they reach adulthood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has already demonstrated his unwillingness to make this commitment to America's children once. No one should withhold healthcare from children in order to score cheap political points or to make divisive partisan attacks. I urge my colleagues in Congress and President Bush to join together in support of American families and children by voting for the reauthorization of SCHIP.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400302" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this is the second time in so many weeks we are standing up for America's children. After the President vetoed the State Children's Health Insurance bill, he has still not seen the light ..... but he has felt the heat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since that veto, and a flurry of negotiations to tweak the bill to engage the President to sign it, the American people have spoken out with gusto: they believe this is a commonsense bill that will serve our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so this bill is before us again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge Members of the House and the President to stand this time with working families and children ..... not with insurance companies. The President's veto cut off health care for over 120,000 kids in Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress created SCHIP in 1997 with broad bipartisan support. This year, 6 million children have health care because of SCHIP. The program has worked well in Texas. This has been an excellent investment for our nation, given that health care costs without insurance would be much more expensive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President highlighted his support for SCHIP while running for re-election in 2004. Today we are giving him--and those who stood with him in sustaining his veto--one more chance to do the right thing for America's children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This children's healthcare program was never intended to replace Medicaid. It only covers the children of parents who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but earn too little to purchase private health insurance. For the President to continue to misrepresent this fact shows a tremendous lack of sensitivity for working Americans who often take on two jobs to simply feed and clothe their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is these families who need to know we are on their side, and I urge the President this time around to join us in taking care of "the least of these."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this bill. We are the last hope of children and families all over this country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400412" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said "of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane." <bill type="h" number="3963">H.R. 3963</bill> does not end health care inequality, but it would PROVIDE continued coverage for children not covered by Medicaid, whose parents cannot afford to buy insurance and whose employers do not provide it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These children--currently 6 million of them--are now eligible for coverage under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)--but that program is set to expire and the President should have accepted this compromise legislation. Because the President would not accept the bi-partisan compromise bill we passed earlier, these six million children will go without health insurance unless Congress acts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would assure continued coverage for those now enrolled and would ALSO provide coverage for an additional four million children who currently qualify, but who are not yet enrolled under CHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The past concerns raised against SCHIP reauthorization by some have been addressed. The language concerning coverage levels and citizenship have been clarified and strengthened to remove any doubt that illegal immigrants are not covered under SCHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority of uninsured children are currently eligible for coverage--but better outreach and adequate funding are needed to identify and enroll them. This bill gives States the tools and incentives necessary to reach millions of uninsured children who are eligible for, but not enrolled in, the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, I voted for the "CHAMP" bill to extend CHIP. The House of Representatives passed that bill, and I had hoped the Senate would follow suit. It would have increased funding for the CHIP program to $50 million, instead of the lesser amount provided by this bill. The CHAMP bill would have also addressed major health care issues, first by protecting traditional Medicare and second by addressing the catastrophic 10 percent payment cuts to physicians who serve Medicare patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, in a compromise with the Senate, Congress did not send the CHAMP bill to the president. Instead, we passed a more limited, bipartisan compromise. Regrettably, the president chose to veto it and his veto was sustained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So here we are again, the bill in front of us today deserves our strong support. It will pay for continued CHIP coverage by raising the federal tax by $0.61 per pack of cigarettes and similar amounts on other tobacco products. According to the American Cancer society, this means that youth smoking will be reduced by seven percent while overall smoking will be reduced by four percent, with the potential that 900,000 lives will be saved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3963">H.R. 3963</bill> has the support of the American Medical Association, American Association of Retired Persons, Catholic Health Association, Healthcare Leadership Council, National Associations of Children's Hospitals, American Nurses Association, U.S. Conference of Mayors, NAACP, American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, and United Way of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is imperative that we pass this legislation in order to protect those that are most vulnerable in our society by increasing health insurance coverage for low-income children. I hope that we have the opportunity to take up the other important Medicare issues addressed in the CHAMP bill soon.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400388" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today we will again vote on a Government-run health insurance program for children: one that only a handful of people in the Democrat leadership have crafted, and one which only a handful of  people received before it was introduced under the cover of night. The Democrat leadership, in the 110th Congress, has continually attempted to ram through legislation that has completely ignored the legislative process, and time after  time nothing has been accomplished. This behavior is why this Democrat-led Congress has an abysmal 11 percent approval rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The facts provided by the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, state that the bill before us today will provide free Government-run health care to a family, including adults, earning more than $60,000 a year. This bill will also increase taxes on tobacco, the revenue of which will not be set aside for this program, but rather will be put into the Treasury for general use. In addition, this bill allows over 10 percent of the funds allotted to provide health care for low-income children to be used  by adults, therefore limiting the amount of money available for needy children. Finally, this legislation fails to ensure that illegal aliens, both children and adults, will not take money away from low-income American children. CBO estimates that under current documentation requirements, 3.7 billion taxpayer dollars will be spent on providing health care to people who have broken our laws and come to our country illegally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The flaws in this legislation are evident and, in my opinion, correctable. Yet, the Democrat leadership refuses to allow this bill to go through the legislative process, a process that has worked in this Chamber for centuries. It is my hope that the Democrat leadership will release their grip on power and allow the legislative process to create a true bipartisan bill so that our Nation's low-income children may receive quality, efficient, and responsible health care.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. I thank and commend the distinguished Chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell, and the chair of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel, as well as the subcommittee chairs, Mr. Pallone and Mr. Stark, for their hard work and dedication in bringing this bill to the floor today. I also want to commend the Speaker of the House,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The issue before us is simple. Either you believe that 10 million low-income kids deserve health care or you don't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know the President and some of my Republican colleagues don't want to have this debate. They don't want another vote on the S-CHIP bill. They want this issue to just go away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I have some news.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This isn't going away. We're going to keep fighting until 10 million kids get the health care they so desperately need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is astounding to me--it literally takes my breath away--to watch President Bush fight to deny health care to children. It is shameful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From day one, President Bush and the Republican leadership in the House trashed Democratic proposals to insure children who--at no fault of their own--are falling through the cracks of the health care system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's clear that America's health care system is broken. Too many are uninsured. Too many rely on emergency rooms for their health care. And, at the same time, health care costs continue to rise--making it harder for businesses to provide their workers with the health care they need and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>making it too expensive for individual families to buy on their own. And God forbid if you have a pre-existing condition--you can forget it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us here in Congress have world-class health care, and so do our kids. Maybe the problem is that not enough members of Congress understand what it's like to struggle, to spend sleepless nights worrying about a sick child, wondering how you're going to pay for their doctor's visits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the Democratic majority--with the help of some brave Republican Members--will once again approve an S-CHIP bill that provides health care to 10 million children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is what we were sent to Congress to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only logical conclusion we can take from President Bush's veto, from the partisan political attacks on a 12-year-old boy and his family, and from the continued stonewalling of this bill, is that the majority of Republicans don't want to provide health care to children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's that simple. Republican leaders tried to block this bill in the Energy and Commerce Committee. Then they stretched the truth about who would be covered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's be honest here--the House and the Senate will approve this bill and President Bush--the former compassionate conservative candidate--will veto it. The question is, how many Republicans will continue to vote to deny health care to 10 million children and how many will--for the well-being of these children--decide to stop playing politics and vote to override the veto?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, House Democrats have come more than halfway. This bill doesn't go as far as I would like, but it's a good, bipartisan effort. It addresses the issues raised by some on the other side of the aisle. The bill President Bush vetoed never provided health care to illegal immigrants--despite the incorrect claims coming from the other side. This bill makes that even clearer. The bill President Bush vetoed never provided health care to families making $83,000 a year and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>neither does this bill. The bill President Bush vetoed took 2 years to phase out adults currently on the S-CHIP program and this bill speeds that timeline up to 1 year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear--under this bill, families who can afford health care will not be eligible for S-CHIP. Under this bill, illegal immigrants will not be eligible for S-CHIP. Under this bill, adults will not be eligible for S-CHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But 10 million American children who don't have health care will get the help they so desperately need. The time has come for the members of this body to make a choice--will they stand with the children of America, or will they stand with President Bush?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know where I stand, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time to stop playing games with the lives of children. It's time to pass this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400283" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007. Truly, we face a health care crisis in this country--in the richest country on Earth, 46 million Americans do not have health insurance, including 9 million children. Today's bipartisan, bicameral compromise is not a perfect solution to that problem but is a decisive, strong step towards covering uninsured kids and fulfilling our moral obligation to our  children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home state of Virginia, the CHIP program currently provides coverage to 137,642 low-income children each year; 171,642 children in Virginia remain uninsured, and the CHIP Reauthorization Act will help us cover 74,200 of these children. The CHIP Reauthorization Act will ensure that these children have access to high quality health care, including the preventative services that children need to be healthy and successful in school and later in life. This bill will provide dental and mental  health benefits on par with medical and surgical services--truly ensuring that the whole child's health is provided for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CHIP Reauthorization Act does this without increasing the deficit, by increasing the Federal excise tax on cigarettes. In my view as chairman of the Congressional Prevention Caucus, an increase in the Federal tobacco tax is sound public health policy. It provides a reliable revenue source to offset the costs of expanding coverage to low-income children and it will reduce health care costs in this country by reducing the prevalence of chronic disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also addresses a serious problem arising from the implementation of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. Opponents of this responsible, common-sense, humane adjustment claim that language in the 2005 Deficit Reduction Act, DRA, that imposed harsher citizenship verification requirements on state Medicaid programs, is the only barrier protecting taxpayer dollars from being spent on healthcare for illegal immigrants. Madam Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First and foremost, existing Federal law and provisions in the CHIP Reauthorization Act prevent Federal funds from being spent to provide benefits for illegal immigrants. Section 605  specifically states that "nothing in this act allows Federal payment for individuals who are not legal immigrants." Illegal immigrants have never been eligible for Medicaid, and nothing in the CHIP Reauthorization Act would change that fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, the DRA requirements have overwhelmingly failed to save taxpayer dollars. Instead, they have imposed substantial additional costs on taxpayers while reducing health care benefits available to poor children. Wait times have skyrocketed, and measures to streamline the application process have been rendered impossible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, these draconian requirements, which are far stricter than those employed by other government programs, have caused tens of thousands of U.S. citizen children to lose health insurance coverage. In Virginia, there was a net decline of more than 11,000 children enrolled in Medicaid during the first 9 months of implementation. Kansas has seen a net decline of 14,000 children. The Virginia State Medicaid Office has identified a total of two undocumented immigrants during this period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The debate about reauthorizing SCHIP should be about the public health and improving the health of our children. In a recent survey, 90 percent of parents applying for Medicaid for their children indicated that they have no other health coverage available. Allowing State flexibility in citizenship verification is sound public health policy that would enable thousands of American children access to vital  health services to help them live better, healthier,  and more productive lives. Twenty-four Senators, twelve Governors, and fifty-one other House Members joined me in requesting that this important provision be included. I thank the Committees for including this provision, and for working with our Republican colleagues to improve the provision and ensure that SCHIP and Medicaid serve the low-income American children they were aimed at.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reauthorizing SCHIP is sound public health policy--research shows that children who have access to health insurance are substantially more likely to access key preventative services, miss fewer days of school due to illness, get better grades, and continue to have superior outcomes later in life. Moreover, the financial benefits of covering children vastly outweigh the costs--one need only compare the cost of a visit to a primary care provider to the cost of a night spent in the emergency room  to see this. But above all, covering all our children is a moral imperative--it is the only possible humane, responsible course of action. I urge a yes vote on the underlying bill, and furthermore, would urge the President, in the strongest possible terms, not to veto this vitally needed, responsible legislation to cover the most vulnerable members of our society: our children.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I appreciate my good friend, Mr. Dingell, asking that the motion to recommit be read. I did the same thing in committee on the 593-page bill, so I think payback is fair. So I don't have a problem with that. I hope that the Members in the Chamber actually listened to the reading of the Clerk, because those that did will agree with me on the following things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, we have taken the 293-page bill that we got at approximately 7 p.m. last evening and left most of it untouched. We have changed approximately 15 pages of a 293-page bill. We have listened carefully to our friends on the majority side at what they say they want, and we have tried to implement those changes in this motion to recommit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We start out with the fact that our friends on the majority side agree with us that SCHIP should be for the poor and the near-poor in American society. This motion to recommit eliminates the loophole for income-disregards that would allow States to actually cover children and families in all probability well above 300 percent. So we have an elimination action in this motion to recommit that would eliminate that loophole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also believe that before you go above 200 percent of poverty, you should cover the children below 200 percent of poverty, so we have a requirement in the motion to recommit that States cannot go above 200 percent of poverty until they have covered at least 90 percent of the eligible SCHIP and Medicare children below 200 percent of the poverty line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We take statements like Chairman Rangel of the Ways and Means Committee and Chairman Dingell of the Energy and Commerce Committee at face value when they say they don't want illegal aliens to be covered in the bill. We put a requirement in the motion to recommit that applies the same citizenship documentation requirements for SCHIP as we have for Medicaid in the Deficit Reduction Act and applies those to the 16 States that it does not currently apply to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also take the majority at their word when they say that they really want SCHIP to be for children. The motion to recommit would take all adults off the program within 1 year except for pregnant women. We would continue to cover pregnant women under the SCHIP program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a concern about when you begin to go above 200 percent of poverty that you actually begin to crowd out the private insurance market, so we do have a requirement in the motion to recommit that if a State wants to go above 200 percent of poverty, they have to have, they must have, a premium support assistance program that would give those families that have private insurance the option to continue to receive the private insurance, and they get premium assistance from that State government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the motion to recommit has been scored by the CBO as saving at least $10 billion from the pending bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, in full disclosure, I need to point out we do not change in the motion to recommit the pay-for, so the portion of the underlying bill that does have a tobacco tax, we do not touch that. We don't try to move it up, we don't try to move it down, we don't try to substitute for it. The motion to recommit that we offered in August had that same provision, but I think in the interests of full disclosure, we need to put that on the table.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I begin with an expression of my affection and respect for my good friend from Texas (Mr. Barton). In most matters he is an extraordinarily fine legislator, except on occasions when he offers these motions to recommit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I begin by pointing out that my good friend's motion to recommit is the same tax about which there have been such prodigious complaints by my Republican colleagues, but that fewer kids are covered, and that there are many impediments inserted into the bill by the motion to recommit to covering the number of kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having said that, my colleagues on the other side say they want to ensure that lowest-income States are covered, but they strike the bonus payments that CBO says will get 1.9 million of the lowest-income children covered who would not otherwise be covered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Second, they say they are for working families. But it is interesting to note that they are forcing, by this, many of the working families who would receive coverage under the bill before us are forced to go onto welfare in order to get health care because they strike the provisions which would discourage that kind of unfortunate event. My colleagues, I would observe, still have the wrong medicine for the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in addition to this, the recommit would prohibit States looking to expand coverage to a family of three at $52,000 from doing so unless they meet arbitrary enrollment targets. The result of that is, of course, again harder for people who deserve and need this kind of relief to get this kind of benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The last point I want to make here is their proposal does not remedy the current problem that has caused thousands of children to lose health coverage due to Republican bureaucratic requirements. I would point out something else, and that is my good friends have essentially in this, as near as I can figure, reenacted the President's proposal, which would set forth a directive to the States as to how they will administer this, something that has caused a huge outrage amongst the States, amongst  persons affected and amongst advocates for the poor and the unfortunate. This is perhaps the worst part of what the proposal to recommit does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's look at what the bill does. The bill increases the number of children who are eligible for coverage, for health insurance, from 6.6 to 10 million young Americans. It must be observed that we are doing this amidst a circumstance where we have seen significant increases in the number of our children joining the ranks of the uninsured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill does more. It sees to it that we take care of the problem. Nearly 70 percent of all uninsured children are from families below $41,300 for a family of four. Of the 9 million uninsured children, nearly two-thirds are either preschool or elementary school age. This is the time when health care becomes singularly precious and important to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would remind my colleagues that a Nation is judged by how it treats and cares for those who are most vulnerable and least able to help themselves. The bill sees to it that we amplify and include greater numbers of those who are most dependent upon others for their survival.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in addition to that, I would remind my colleagues that this legislation is something which is of great importance because we are talking about the future of the kids. Giving them health care now when they have need of it is something that ensures that Americans in the future will be the kind of productive, valuable citizens who are able to carry forward the competition of this Nation in some of its most difficult, competitive times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this bill would significantly increase and improve access for needed health care to children. The proposal in the motion to recommit significantly cuts back on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "no" on the motion to recommit and vote for the bill.</paragraph>
