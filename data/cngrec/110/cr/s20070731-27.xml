    <paragraph>Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to extend my warmest congratulations to Michael J. Donoghue on his retirement from the Worcester Regional Retirement System. I commend him for his impressive service to the people of Worcester for the past 30 years, and I know he will be deeply missed by all those he helped and supported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mike's impressive career extends well beyond his time at Worcester Regional Retirement System. He served two terms on the Worcester City Council before being elected Worcester County treasurer in 1978, and his outstanding experience and knowledge of the issues made him a valuable member of many charitable organizations in our city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mike also has served on the board of directors of the Worcester Regional Chamber of Commerce and the Massachusetts Biomedical Initiatives, and he had an invaluable role over the years in establishing Worcester as a center for medical research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us in our State owe Mike our gratitude for his skillful efforts on behalf of the less fortunate. Over the years, he has given his skills and impressive leadership to the board of directors for the Visiting Nurses Association Network Foundation, the Worcester Area Mental Health Association, the Worcester Area United Way, and Special Olympics of Massachusetts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been an honor to call Mike a friend, and I am especially grateful for his decades of kindness to the Kennedy family. I have relied often on Mike over the years for his advice and wise counsel, and I commend him for his service and dedication. It is a special privilege to join his wife Maureen, their children and grandchildren in congratulating him for all he has achieved in his many years of outstanding service to our Commonwealth, and I wish him well in the years ahead.</paragraph>
