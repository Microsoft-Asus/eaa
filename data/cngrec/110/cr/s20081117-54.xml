    <paragraph>Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for testimony in a civil action in Multnomah County Court in Portland, OR. In this action, the plaintiff, an anti-war protester, seeks damages for an alleged false arrest in March 2007 in the lobby of a private office building housing Senator Smith's Portland, OR office. The defendant owner of the building has requested that an employee in the Senator's Portland office provide in connection with upcoming summary judgment proceedings  a declaration concerning relevant communications the employee had with building security officers related to the events in question. Senator Smith would like to cooperate by providing testimony from that employee. This resolution would authorize that employee to testify in connection with this action, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel.</paragraph>
