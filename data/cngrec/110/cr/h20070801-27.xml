    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today the United States Congress will take up the full march towards socialized medicine here in the United States. This isn't mission creep, Madam Speaker; this is mission leap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Imagine, under the Democrat plan, someone who is old enough to be able to run for the United States Congress would be considered a child and eligible for taxpayer-subsidized health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is socialized medicine in its truest form. As a matter of fact, in Minnesota today, under the SCHIP proposal, fully 85 percent of all recipients are adults. Under the Democrat proposal in Minnesota, over 20,000 senior citizens in Minnesota will lose their Medicare Advantage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this is mission leap towards embracing full socialized medicine, and I hope this United States Congress rejects this untimely proposal.</paragraph>
