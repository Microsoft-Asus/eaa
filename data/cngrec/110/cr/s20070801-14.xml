    <paragraph>Mr. President, section 301 of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, the 2008 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels for legislation that reauthorizes the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP. On July 30, 2007, I filed revisions to <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill> pursuant to section 301 for Senate amendment No. 2530, which Senator Baucus offered as a substitute to <bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find that Senate amendment No. 2602, as modified, offered by Senator Kerry to Senate amendment No. 2530 satisfies the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund for SCHIP legislation. Therefore, pursuant to section 301, I am further adjusting the aggregates in the 2008 budget resolution, as well as the allocation provided to the Senate Finance Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill> be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
