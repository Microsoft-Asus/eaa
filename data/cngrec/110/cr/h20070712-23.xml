    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker: "Many people think the best way to escape war is to dwell upon its horrors and to imprint them vividly upon the minds of the younger generation. They flaunt the grisly photographs before their eyes. They fill their ears with tales of carnage. They dwell on the ineptitude of generals and admirals. They denounce the crime and the folly of human strife."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These words of Winston Churchill in 1934 stressed upon the people of Great Britain that the cynics, who don't believe some things are worth fighting for, should not have their way. They ignore the victories and accomplishments and, instead, focus upon setbacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>War is hard. It has always been hard. Congress will once again debate a timetable retreat for American troops to leave Iraq. The timid will want to turn their back on the enemy and leave a desperate people and a nation floundering; all this because war is hard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Retreat tells the enemy that if they wait America out, we will bow out of the fight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Churchill also remarked, "war is not won by evacuation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
