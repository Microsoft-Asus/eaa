  <narrative>COMMENDING MOUNT OLIVE TROJANS -- (Senate - June 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5747">S5747</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to congratulate a college baseball team that won a national title last month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am speaking of Mount Olive College in Mount Olive, NC. They beat Ouachita Baptist in a 6-2 victory to win the NCAA Division II National Baseball Championship--the first national championship title of any kind in Mount Olive College history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mount Olive Trojans finished the season with a 58-6 overall record. The Trojans ended their season strong winning 24 out of their final 26 games.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This win marks an especially extraordinary one for Mount Olive College Trojans. This is the Trojans first-ever national championship win in any sport. In a town made famous for their  pickles, baseball can now be added as a point of interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Led by head coach Carl Lancaster, the Trojans were up by a five-run lead at the end of the first inning. Thanks in part to Josh Harrison's at-bat that resulted in a single and Dylan Holton's three-run double, Mount Olive mounted an early 5-0 advantage over Ouachita Baptist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mount Olive College was featured on national television in the May edition of "NCAA On Campus." This gave the players a chance to brag a little about their accomplishments, as all nine players in the Trojans' starting lineup were nationally ranked in at least one statistical category at the time of taping.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Trojans' efforts have not gone unnoticed by Major League Baseball. Five of the players from Mount Olive's 2008 National Championship team will all be playing professionally in the coming year. Additionally, four players have been named All American. This is wonderful news for these deserving young men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also due recognition is the Trojans' academic performance. Their emphasis on academic success earned them a team grade point average of 3.13 on a 4 point scale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The baseball team's success can be attributed to their well-rounded 2008 roster that included: Jackson Massey, Jesse Lancaster, Anthony Hernandez, Anthony Williams, Weston Curles, Todd Jeffreys, David Cooper, Mike Kicia, Paul Novicki, Tyler Smith, Pat Ball, Alex Vertcnik, Dylan Holton, Rich Racobaldo, Joseph Westbrook, Andy Hilliard, Kyle Jones, Jason Sherrer, Josh Harrison, Casey Hodges, Erik Lovett, Michael Williams, Ryan Schlecht, Craig Beasley, Thomas Newsome, and Airlon Vinson. The team  was coached by: Carl Lancaster, Aaron Akin, and Rob Watt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I commend the Mount Olive Trojans, the 2008 NCAA Division II Baseball National Championship team and coach Carl Lancaster on an incredible season. Also, I would like to wish those players drafted into the Major Leagues the best of luck.</paragraph>
