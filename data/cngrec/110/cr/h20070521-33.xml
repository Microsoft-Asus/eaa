    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as many of us have been doing over the past couple of years and months, I paid tribute to a fallen soldier in my district this past weekend. Private First Class Jones was young and vibrant and loved by his family. Those who loved him had to bury him, for he is another of those now fallen from the violence in Iraq. We pay tribute to him for his great service and his love of country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time now for America to love her own even more. It is time for our soldiers to come home. As we prepare for the honoring of those fallen in many wars, it becomes more than a disservice to those brave men and women for the President not to join this Congress in the resolution of this misdirected mission, in order to ensure that our troops come home with accolades and recognition because their mission has been successful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The political mission is a failure, and it's time now for us to vote on a supplemental that has benchmarks and, as well, timelines to redeploy our troops, whether to Kuwait or otherwise. Our troops must come home. I pay tribute to the fallen. I pay tribute to Private First Class Jones.</paragraph>
