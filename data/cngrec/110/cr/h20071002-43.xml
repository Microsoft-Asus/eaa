STATEMENT OF POLICY.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It is the policy of the United States to--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) support the advancement of human rights, democracy, independence of the judiciary, freedom of the press, peacekeeping capacity building, and economic development in the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) seek the unconditional release of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Ethiopia;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) foster stability, democracy, and economic development in the region;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) support humanitarian assistance efforts, especially in the Ogaden region;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) collaborate with Ethiopia in the Global War on Terror; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) strengthen United States-Ethiopian relations based on the policy objectives specified in paragraphs (1) through (5).&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3.

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, first let me thank Chairman Lantos for his leadership in bringing this bill up and the ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, and the ranking member of the Africa and Global Health Subcommittee, Mr. Smith, for <bill type="h" number="2003">H.R. 2003</bill>, the Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ethiopia is one of our most reliable allies as one of Africa's most capable peacekeeping forces and is making positive steps towards a prosperous economy and functioning democracy. However, Ethiopia continues to be a country riven with conflict that threatens to tear the country apart. Ethiopia took a major step backwards in the immediate aftermath of the 2005 general elections when the Prime Minister declared a state of emergency, outlawed any public gatherings, and placed all security forces  under his direct command. While the government performed commendably in negotiations with opposition parties before the election, the response after the election set off a violent confrontation between the opposition and the government. The opposition accused the government of vote rigging and fraud and called for a public demonstration and civil disorder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The government responded by ordering the security forces to fire live ammunition at demonstrators, killing some and detaining opposition leaders and their followers. In spite of continued negotiations between the government and the opposition, the political environment continued to deteriorate, resulting in regrettable death of civilians and police.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An estimated 112 political leaders, human rights activists, community leaders and journalists, including the founder of the Ethiopian Human Rights Council, were imprisoned and charged with treason and genocide. In spite of international pleas for more measured responses by the government towards its civilians, the Government of Ethiopia has continued to stifle and criminalize opposition activities and to intimidate and silence civil society and independent journalists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before the House will withhold nonhumanitarian funds from the Ethiopian Government until democracy and respect for human rights are fully restored. It will send a strong signal of dissatisfaction toward the Ethiopian Government and increase pressure on the Ethiopian leaders to change. As I indicated, in leading up to the election, the government made debates available, opened up journalism and had the opposition candidates on equal footing. However, after the results, 193 people  were killed, shot and murdered by sharpshooters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are very disturbed. We urge our colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400380" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in very, very strong support of the Ethiopian Democracy and Accountability Act. I am very happy that it has finally been brought to the floor. It is legislation that will limit and condition U.S. Government assistance on the Ethiopian Government provided that the government meets a very modest list of human rights benchmarks and provides financial support to human rights promoters in Ethiopia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Ethiopian Democracy and Accountability Act is as timely now as it was last year, maybe even more so after the failure of so many attempts to promote human rights reform through dialogue and persuasion. It is clear that stronger measures are necessary, and they must come now. Human rights abuses have to be penalized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, Human Rights Watch reported that the Ethiopian Government, fighting an insurgency in Ogaden region, had forcibly displaced thousands of civilians in that region, burned villages and food stocks and imposed a trade blockade on the region. Just a few minutes ago in the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health, we heard from a number of witnesses who told us very chilling tales. People who were there on the ground, human rights reporters on the ground were documenting the abuse that is  being committed against people: rape, and a whole host of other gross indignities being committed, crimes against humanity by government forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, even the U.S. Department of State in its "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2006" points out that there were numerous credible reports that security officials often beat or mistreated detainees. Massive arrests and detentions are common, the reports went on to say. Although the Ethiopian Constitution and law prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, the government frequently did not observe these provisions in practice. Authorities regularly detained persons without  warrants and denied access to counsel and family members, particularly in the outlying regions. The Independent Commission of Inquiry found that security officials held over 30,000 civilians incommunicado for up to 3 months in detention centers located in remote areas. Other estimates place the number of such detainees as high as 50,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is only part of a long series of human rights outrages, Mr. Speaker, committed by Prime Minister Meles. On June 20, 2005, after an election that displeased the Prime Minister, almost 200 pro-democracy demonstrators in Addis were slaughtered when they demanded that there be a true accurate accounting of how people voted. It was a magnificent outpouring of Ethiopians. They voted. Eighty-five percent of the eligible voters poured out to vote despite much intimidation and despite the fact that  many of the election observers all of a sudden were thrown out of the country by the Meles government, including NDI and the International Republican Institute. So they weren't there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But despite all that, people voted, only to have, in many cases, their votes discounted by the government. Then, as people took to the streets to protest, like I said, almost 200 pro-democracy demonstrators were gunned down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I visited Ethiopia in August of that year and met with Prime Minister Meles, I urged him to investigate that atrocity, to punish those who were responsible and to release the political prisoners. Meles told me, I have a file on all of them, that is to say, all of the opposition leaders. He said, They are all guilty of treason. It is hard to put faith in the reformist intentions of a government official who says those kind of things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I believe that neither we nor the international community has pushed Meles hard enough on human rights and democracy issues because we have been satisfied perhaps that they cooperate with us to some extent in the war on terror. I would point out to my colleagues that the war on terror is very important, but no regime that terrorizes its own citizens can be a reliable ally in the war on terror. Terrorism isn't just a military issue. It is also a human rights issue. Terrorists come  from countries where their governments fail to respect their human rights. In promoting human rights in Ethiopia, we are attacking terrorism at its root.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have come to know and admire many people from Ethiopia's great and ancient civilization. I ensure my colleagues that democracy, human rights, and rule of law are things that they desperately want for their country. It should be our country's policy to promote these important things which correspond with our own long-term interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill; and, again, I congratulate my good friend and colleague from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) for his leadership on this very important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me once again thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) who has worked so hard on this issue of Ethiopia. We are very pleased that today the proof it is coming to fruition is the fact that this bill is here on the floor. I, too, met with Prime Minister Meles in the summer of 2006 and asked if he would consider releasing the prisoners. He once again said that it is up to the judiciary. It is not in his hands. I then went to the Kality prison and met with  two of the witnesses who just testified this morning Dr. Nega and Ms. Mideska, who appreciated the pressure and the insistence that we had through the years and because perhaps they would still be in prison. But they are here as free citizens testifying before  the Africa and Global Health Subcommittee this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, once again, we have also in this bill made provisions to assist the Government of Ethiopia. We are saying that you need help in your judicial system, and there are funds in it for that, that we hope to get appropriated. We say the health system is in disrepair, and there are funds in it to help the health system. We say that there is a need for water projects, and in this bill there is financial assistance to help in the economic development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is a bill that we are saying that Ethiopia is an ally of the United States. We need a strong Ethiopia. But we need a democratic Ethiopia, not an Ethiopia that is run by a dictatorial regime. So we are hoping that this bill will move forward and effect change in that great country with such a long and rich history.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400283" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act of 2007. As an original cosponsor of this legislation, I commend the majority and minority managers and urge strong support for this measure to support human rights, democracy, independence of the judiciary, freedom of the press, peacekeeping capacity building, and economic development in the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia; to collaborate with Ethiopia in the Global War on Terror; to  seek the release of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Ethiopia; to foster stability, democracy, and economic development in the region; and, finally, to strengthen U.S.-Ethiopian relations. This is a message not just to the leadership in Ethiopia, but also to the Secretary of State to take specified actions to support human rights and democratization in Ethiopia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This important legislation expresses the sense of Congress that we should encourage the government of Ethiopia to enter into discussions with peaceful political groups to bring them into full participation in Ethiopia's political and economic affairs. We need to provide the necessary assistance to help achieve such a goal, so this legislation directs the President to provide Ethiopia with resource policy assistance and health care assistance. This legislation is crafted to seek a balance and  return democracy to one of the African continent's oldest democracies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Northern Virginia is home to one of the largest African immigrant populations in America, with significant numbers of Nigerians, Ethiopians, Eritreans, Somalians, and Ghanaians. They both enrich our culture, and enrich our appreciation of what a return to democracy in Ethiopia could mean. Ethiopia's peoples--in my District, in our country, and in Africa are the proud representatives of a great and ancient civilization. I believe we have an opportunity and responsibility to them to help restore  democracy, human rights, and the rule of law--goals they want desperately for their own country. It should be our country's policy as well to promote these objectives which correspond to our long-term interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What it ought not to mean was last summer's sentencing of 35 opposition politicians and activists to life in prison--in a case where the prosecution had asked for the death penalty against the defendants, who included Ethiopia's top opposition leaders. Those sentenced to life imprisonment include the leader of the Coalition for Unity and Democracy, Hailu Shawel; Berhanu Nega, who was elected mayor of Addis Ababa; former Harvard scholar Mesfin Woldemariam; and former U.N. special envoy and former  Norfolk State University professor, Yacob Hailemariam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus, this is an important step for the Congress to take to foster accountability for the actions the Ethiopian government has taken that undermine rule of law and fundamental political freedoms. It is an important act to restrict security assistance for Ethiopia until such time as the President certifies that, among other things, the government of Ethiopia has taken steps to release political prisoners, hold security forces accountable for human rights abuses related to the demonstrations of  2005, and the Meles regime is respecting freedom of speech and information and allowing human rights groups to operate without being harassed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For, as our colleague Chris Smith said, "Terrorism is not just a military issue; it is also a human rights issue. Terrorists come from countries whose governments failed to respect their human rights. In promoting human rights in Ethiopia, we are attacking terrorism at its roots." It is for this reason that the bill also contains provisions for economic assistance and health care assistance for victims of torture, and it authorizes $20 million in 2008 and $20 million in 2009 to carry  out these provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Equally important, this legislation is intended to promote accountability for the killing of innocent civilians by government security forces, to build the institutions of democracy, and to provide meaningful support for human rights and those who defend them in Ethiopia. It requires our Secretary of State to support human rights by establishing a mechanism to provide funds to local human rights organizations and victims' support networks to provide legal support for political prisoners and prisoners  of conscience. In this legislation, we require the Secretary of State to put in place a means to identify and extradite members of the Mengistu regime currently residing in the United States. We are trying, through this effort today, to balance this demand for accountability by supporting democratization through directing the State Department to provide assistance to strengthen local, regional, and national democratic processes through training authorities,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does provide flexibility for the administration by providing a waiver the President can exercise to continue security assistance to programs with Ethiopia that support U.S. efforts on the Global War on Terror and the Ethiopians' efforts in United Nations peacekeeping and whatever is deemed necessary for the U.S. national interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we cannot and must not remain silent, but rather we have an obligation to do much more in order to promote the rule of law and respect for fundamental freedoms in Ethiopia--a very proud country with a tremendous heritage and history. We want to see Ethiopia move back, as it has in the past, to being our good ally. We can no longer allow this situation to fester.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400228" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2003">H.R. 2003</bill>, the Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act of 2007. This important legislation authorizes $20 million for both FY 2008 and FY 2009 to provide economic support for Ethiopia, the oldest independent nation in Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2003">H.R. 2003</bill> provides a framework for support programs designed to impact all aspects of Ethiopian society. The bill would provide financial support to human rights groups to continue their efforts in Ethiopia, as well as expand the Voice of America's Ethiopia program. The legislation would also provide economic development assistance, with a focus on meeting the healthcare needs of the Ethiopian people. The legislation also requires the President to submit a report to the Congress outlining a comprehensive  plan to address Ethiopia's many economic, security, and human rights issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps most importantly, <bill type="h" number="2003">H.R. 2003</bill> places a number of limitations on our country's dealings with the Ethiopian government, requiring that a number of benchmarks be met before the full support of the United States is realized. The Ethiopian Government must allow the media to operate freely; the judiciary must operate independent of government influence; all political prisoners must be released; internet access cannot be restricted; and human rights and democratization groups must be allowed to  operate free of government interference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe our country can be a positive and powerful influence to the Ethiopians, and I am thankful that this Congress has turned its attention to a people that struggle to achieve the basic human freedoms that we enjoy. I urge adoption of the resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2003">H.R. 2003</bill>, the Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act of 2007, which I, together with over 80 of my colleagues, have co-sponsored. This important legislation reaffirms the United States commitment to supporting human rights, democracy, independence of the judiciary, freedom of the press, and economic development in the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like thank Chairman PAYNE for introducing this important legislation, and Chairman LANTOS for his leadership on this important issue. I was pleased to work with both Chairmen within the Committee on Foreign Affairs to incorporate important language into the bill at the committee markup. As amended, to reflect my language, I believe that this bill is an important and firm diplomatic step toward addressing our serious concerns with Ethiopia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My language will work to bolster an independent judiciary in Ethiopia by encouraging exchanges between Ethiopian and United States jurists, law schools, law professors, and law students, especially in legal fields such as constitutional law, role of the judiciary, due process, habeas corpus, political and voting rights, criminal law and procedure, and discrimination. Mr. Speaker, Ethiopia's judicial system is making important strides forward, but it still requires our support and ongoing engagement.  Such exchanges would be mutually beneficially to both American and Ethiopian legal students and professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I am pleased to have successfully offered language that added exemptions for international military education and training for civilian personnel under section 541 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, commonly referred to as "Expanded IMET," from the restrictions on security assistance until the Government of Ethiopia can certify it has met certain standards of human rights, democracy, and economic development. While I certainly believe these standards are crucial goals, and  that we should be using our aid programs as an incentive for the government to meet these objectives, I also strongly believe that we must continue to fund crucial programs. IMET ensures that the military and related civilian personnel receive a range of necessary training, in important areas including</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I offered language to provide assistance to promote the privatization of government industries and property. As Ethiopia transitions from a socialist structure to an open-market, I believe it is mutually beneficial for us to assist in this groundbreaking transformation. My language authorizes the President, acting through USAID, to provide assistance to promote the privatization of government owned or controlled industries and property in Ethiopia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, though Ethiopia is currently on the road to democracy, I do not believe we should be treating the country with kid gloves. This is a path that should be paved with civil and political discourse, peaceful transitions of power, and respect for human rights. By necessity, the achievement of a modem democracy requires the implementation of electoral reforms, the separation of powers in the government, and the establishment of a truly independent judiciary. These are the founding principles  of our American Republic, and I have seen firsthand the progress on the path to democracy Ethiopia has made since the brutal dictatorship of Mengistu Haile Mariam was brought down in 1991. I strongly believe that the United States should do all it can to support this transition, including bolstering civil society and speaking out when fundamental human rights are violated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Ethiopia is a leader in its region, and in the African continent, and has the potential to be a great global leader. However, years of fighting and alleged abuses are standing in the way of Ethiopia's progress. We need a roadmap toward establishing peace, stability, protection of human rights, and democracy in Ethiopia, and in the entire Horn of Africa region. This will necessitate addressing the ongoing lawlessness in neighboring Somalia, which continues to destabilize and threaten  the entire region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ethiopia has a long and proud history. It is the cradle of mankind, as illustrated by "Lucy," also known as Dinkinesh (Amharic for "you are wonderful"), which is the nearly complete hominid skeleton discovered by archaeologists in the Awash Valley of Ethiopia on November 30, 1974. Lucy is estimated to have lived 3.2 million years ago and has redefined science's understanding of human evolution. I was happy to work with Texas State Senator Rodney Ellis, Ethiopian Ambassador Samuel Assefa,  and the Houston Museum of Natural Science to bring Lucy to Houston, which is one of only 9 American cities and the only city in Texas to host the exhibit. The bones are currently on display in Houston, and will be until April 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ethiopia is also the oldest independent nation in Africa, has never been colonized, and is home to the African Union. Despite Ethiopia's rich history, however, this bill recognizes that recent decades have brought hardship and suffering to Ethiopia's people, through military conflict, natural disasters, and a military dictatorship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For over a decade in the House of Representatives, and prior to that in the Houston city council, I have been an outspoken and unwavering advocate for the country of Ethiopia and its people, both in Ethiopia and in the diaspora. Following in the legendary footsteps of my predecessor, Mickey Leland, who died attempting</paragraph>
    <paragraph>to alleviate the starvation faced by Ethiopia's innocent populace, I have been a champion of increasing foreign aid to, political, economic, and social cooperation with, and improving human rights in Ethiopia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I continue to advocate close interaction and constructive dialogue with Ethiopia and its leaders, I believe the human rights situation there must be addressed. Of particular recent concern was the detention of elected parliamentarians, human rights advocates, and independent journalists and the harsh response to protesters after Ethiopia's recent unprecedented elections in 2005. In response to reports that thousands of prisoners languished in prisons throughout Ethiopia, I was proud to  join a number of my colleagues in sending a letter to Secretary Rice, expressing our strong concern about the treatment of detainees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In July, an Ethiopian court harshly sentenced 35 opposition leaders and activists to life in prison and denied them the right to vote or run for public office on charges of inciting violence. Although I was pleased to see the Court rebuff the prosecution's call for the death sentence against these defendants, I believe that the sentence of life imprisonment is still too severe a punishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I am heartened by the active role that elders such as Professor Ephraim Isaac played in the negotiations for these prisoners' release, and I was extremely pleased that these negotiations led to the release of these prisoners. Only through amnesty will the Ethiopian government and opposition leaders be able to secure a path to reconciliation rather than assuring a future of political divisiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation reaffirms the United States commitment to supporting Ethiopia as it builds the necessary institutions and civil society framework for a successful democracy. It contains a number of important provisions directing the Department of State to provide mechanisms for supporting and monitoring the promotion of human rights and democracy within Ethiopia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I believe that we in Congress should focus on the pursuit of truth. It is extremely important that we seek truthful accounts of what is going on in Ethiopia, and in the entire Horn of Africa region, and that we use these reports to develop a roadmap that will guide Ethiopia along the path to democracy and greater guarantees for human rights. This roadmap must be characterized, above all, by firm diplomacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to conclude by reiterating my firm belief in the extreme importance of supporting the strengthening of democracy and human rights in Ethiopia.</paragraph>
