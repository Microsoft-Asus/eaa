  <narrative>AMERICA COMPETES ACT -- (Senate - July 19, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9574">S9574</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there is a lot of good news today legislatively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 159, <bill type="h" number="2272">H.R. 2272</bill>, the House competitiveness bill; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of the Senate companion, <bill type="s" number="761">S. 761</bill>, as passed by the Senate, be inserted in lieu thereof; the bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say this is the end of a long haul to do a bill that is extremely important. This is a bipartisan bill. There are a number of people who have worked extremely hard on this legislation but no one harder than Senators Bingaman and Alexander. I apologize for only mentioning their names. I am sure there are many others who worked just as hard as they did. I remember they were the first two who talked to me about it, and there has been a lot of time spent on  this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a bill that was passed in the Senate with little opposition. I am so happy we can now go to conference. The House has already passed something. We can come back with a bill that I think will really help productivity in our country and help the educational aspects of students, especially in the scientific fields.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I will not object--there have been a number of people on both sides of the aisle who have been deeply invested in this America COMPETES Act. Several of them will be shortly announced by the Chair as conferees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Particularly, I want to single out Senator Stevens, Senator Enzi, Senator Ensign, and Senator Coleman, all of whom will be named conferees, and, of course, Senator Alexander and Senator Domenici, who were really the leaders on our side, in conjunction with Senator Bingaman, in developing this important bipartisan legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Alexander kept pushing others forward. But, in fact, we all knew who the real leader on our side was on this issue. He, in a very selfless way, helped move a bipartisan group together to form this important legislation. I commend Senator Alexander in particular for the role he played in all of this.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <chair>Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <chair>The bill (<bill type="h" number="2272">H.R. 2272</bill>), as amended, was read the third time and passed.</chair>
  <chair>The Presiding Officer appointed Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Ensign, and Mr. Coleman conferees on the part of the Senate.</chair>
  <chair> The Senator from Massachusetts.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I join the two leaders in thanking our colleagues and thank them for moving this process forward in naming these conferees on the America COMPETES Act. I wish to underline the excellent work that was done under the bipartisan leadership of Senator Bingaman and Senator Alexander, and the other members of our committee. They have worked long and hard on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A very distinguished leader in business, Norm Augustine--who has been the head of many of our defense industries and is a real statesman in terms of defense policy--was enormously important in helping guide the bipartisan group, to get recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the National Science Foundation, and others, to help prepare this legislation, and to make recommendations to the House and the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an enormously important effort to ensure that the United States can continue to be competitive in the world economy for years ahead. I think this is a very solid and important bipartisan effort. I join with our two leaders, thanking them for their recommendations in terms of conferees, and join in commending the bipartisan effort that has seen this as continuing progress.</paragraph>
