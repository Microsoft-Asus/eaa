    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Trooper Robert "Bobby" Hayslip of West Union, Ohio, for being awarded the Ohio State Highway Patrol's Trooper of the Year Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trooper Bobby Hayslip was commissioned a State Trooper only 6 years ago as part of the 138th academy class and has quickly risen to the top. Bobby's District Commander, Captain Daniel Kolcum, best describes him as being hardworking and aggressive but also compassionate and professional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trooper Hayslip is known for being a leader in making both enforcement and non-enforcement contacts; he is constantly working to keep Ohioans safe through investigations, assisting motorists, and getting drunk and impaired drivers off Ohio's roads. The dedication of Trooper Hayslip does not end after his shift. It continues in his free time as a volunteer working with local juvenile traffic offenders and at-risk high school students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am very thankful that the best trooper in the State of Ohio is patrolling Ohio's Second Congressional District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations, Bobby, and continued success in years to come.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
