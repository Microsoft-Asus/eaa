  <narrative>OPPOSING ARMENIAN GENOCIDE RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11399]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400431" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose a nonbinding resolution that will have serious negative consequences to our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="106">H. Res. 106</bill>, the Armenian Genocide resolution, is a dangerously short-sighted and controversial resolution that is being marked up in the Foreign Affairs Committee today. This resolution will jeopardize our relationship with a strong NATO ally, Turkey, and hinder our ability to combat the global war on terror. This resolution makes assertions about facts that historians to this date still debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might add that every living former Secretary of State, both Democrat and Republican, recently sent a letter to the Speaker stating that passage of this resolution would "strain our relations with Turkey, endanger our national security interests, including the safety of our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also point out that in today's Washington Post in an editorial, it said that "passage of the Armenian Genocide resolution would be dangerous and grossly irresponsible." I hope the Foreign Affairs Committee today will reject this resolution.</paragraph>
