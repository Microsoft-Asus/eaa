    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is time we restore fiscal sanity to Washington. In 6 short years, Republican policies turned a $5.6 trillion surplus into a $3 trillion deficit. That is an $8 trillion reversal of fortune.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And last year, congressional Republicans never came to an agreement on the budget and refused to pass nine of the 11 must-pass appropriations bills before adjourning in December. This isn't how the appropriations process is supposed to work, and the American people know it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats vow we are going to get things done and done on time. This year, Democrats brought much-needed reform to Congress by passing a rules package that require Democrats to pay-as-we-go. This isn't a new idea. From 1990 to 2002, Congresses and administrations of both parties abided by commonsense rules that stated you couldn't cut taxes and increase spending unless you paid for it. Pay-as-you-go was one of the main reasons Washington balanced the books in the 1990s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, since Republicans were unable to do their job last year, Democrats will bring a final bill to the floor that will fund key priorities. This bill will allow us to move forward with fiscal sanity.</paragraph>
