  <narrative>ABANDONED MINE LANDS PROGRAM -- (Senate - December 06, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14818">S14818</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in anger, in disbelief, and in disgust over the bureaucratic inner workings of Washington. There is a program called the Abandoned Mine Lands Program. It was created as a Federal-State partnership. The Federal Government collects the money and then it is designed to return half to the States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over many years, administrations of both parties have failed to honor the Federal Government's responsibility and commitment to the States and to the tribes. I recently learned the Office of Surface Mining has decided to delay and withhold $600 million in funding owed to the people of Wyoming and to deny hundreds of millions of dollars more owed to States nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have used an internal policy memo to manipulate the law. Doing so is nothing short of outrageous. This most recent decision reeks of bureaucratic doublespeak, and it does it to achieve an outcome I believe was predetermined. I cannot attempt to explain their decision or their reasoning because the decision, to me, was already predetermined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This action represents a sad example of why so many Americans, and why my constituents back home in Wyoming, have lost faith in Washington. The words of the Washington bureaucrats ring hollow. I am, frankly, amazed, amazed the bureaucrats can take the clear language, the language from this body that says: Payments shall be made in seven equal installments. And then they twist those words into a grant program requiring review and making an application. Their interpretation is inconsistent with  the law that was debated by this body last year and signed by the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their interpretation is nothing less than nonsense and obstructive. This summer, 17 days after I was sworn into the Senate, I opposed the nomination of the Director of the Office of Surface Mining in the Energy Committee over this very issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I asked specific questions and did not get specific answers. Now this. I take our legislative oversight responsibilities very seriously. I pledge to you, I pledge to the people of Wyoming, and I pledge to the people of the other States and the other tribes to whom Washington owes money that I will explore every avenue, every avenue available, to right this wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's be clear: This money is not Washington's money. This money belongs to the States and to the people. It does not belong to Washington. It does certainly not belong to Washington's evasive bureaucracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>

    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
