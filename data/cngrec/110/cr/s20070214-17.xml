  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="NOMINATION OF NORA BARRY FISCHER TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA">
    <paragraph>Madam President, Nora Barry Fischer is an accomplished and well-respected attorney with over 30 years of legal experience. She is nominated to a seat on the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. She received her law degree from Notre Dame University Law School, and graduated magna cum laude from St. Mary's College, Notre Dame, with a B.A. in history and humanistic studies. She has been an attorney with the law firm of Meyer, Darragh, Buckler, Bebenek</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senator Casey for expediting his consideration of this nomination. As a courtesy to Senator Specter, I asked the former majority leader to proceed to this nomination in December last year. Regrettably, Senator Frist chose not to do so and Senator Specter's chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee ended without this nomination having been confirmed. I am glad that, at long last, the Senate has turned its attention to this nomination and is granting its  consent. I thank Majority Leader Reid for acting promptly.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Pennsylvania.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I have sought recognition to speak in favor of the pending nomination of a distinguished Pennsylvania lawyer, Mrs. Nora Barry Fischer, who is to be considered for the position of a U.S. district judge for the Western District of Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Casey and I strongly endorse her confirmation. She is a Pennsylvania native with a distinguished academic record. She graduated magna cum laude from St. Mary's College with a B.A. degree in 1973 and received a law degree from Notre Dame Law School in 1976. She has had a distinguished law practice with the Pittsburgh firm of Meyer, Darragh, Buckler, Bebenek &amp; Eck and later at Pietragallo, Bosick &amp; Gordon. She served as an administrative partner in charge of recruitment and training  and served as co-chair of the Defense Litigation Practice, which is Pietragallo Bosick's largest practice group. As Special Master for the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, she handled conciliations, nonjury and jury trials by consent of the parties, which gives her a leg up on analogous judicial duties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Fischer is the recipient of a number of awards. The Pennsylvania Bar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession awarded her the Anne X. Alpern Award for her efforts to promote women in the law. The Pennsylvania Bar Association also recognized Mrs. Fischer for her work as co-chair of the Task Force on Health Care Delivery in Pennsylvania. She was named the recipient of the 2006 Professionalism Award by the Civil Litigation Section of the Allegheny County Bar Association for her faithful  adherence to the highest standards of legal professionalism. She has been recognized as a Pennsylvania Super Lawyer and as one of the Top 50 Women Super Lawyers in Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Bar Association has unanimously rated Mrs. Fischer "well qualified" to serve as a federal district court judge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She is precisely the type of nominee we are looking for, and I believe she will do very well in this very important position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, in the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="NOMINATION OF NORA BARRY FISCHER TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="NOMINATION OF NORA BARRY FISCHER TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA">
    <paragraph>Madam President, am I correct that there is a vote ordered at 4:45 p.m.?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> That is correct.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="NOMINATION OF NORA BARRY FISCHER TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA">
    <paragraph>And is the time between now and 4:45 p.m. allocated?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> It is divided between the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="NOMINATION OF NORA BARRY FISCHER TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA">
    <paragraph>Madam President, if the chairman of the Judiciary Committee is not here to take the time, let me take a moment. If he shows up, I certainly will yield to him.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="NOMINATION OF NORA BARRY FISCHER TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I will be glad to yield to the Senator from North Dakota, especially since he called me the chairman.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="NOMINATION OF NORA BARRY FISCHER TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA">
    <paragraph>I was talking about the chairman who was about to show up, Senator Leahy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I withdraw my consent.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="BRAC">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to make a point. My colleague from Oklahoma was talking about the BRAC funding. I think everybody here supports the BRAC funding. I certainly do. It is not a part of this agreement, but it is not, as the Senator from Oklahoma suggested, the Democrats' fault.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just so people understand, we inherited a heck of a mess. We inherited a huge mess. What was the mess? The fact is, last year, 10 of the appropriations bills never got to the floor of the Senate. We never got here. They never had any discussion on them. Had that happened, we would have had those appropriations bills passed and signed into law, and we wouldn't be discussing these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of inheriting an unbelievable mess, we had to put together something between the House and the Senate. Let me make this point: That which was done between the House and the Senate included discussions with Republicans and Democrats on every single subcommittee. We engaged the staff of the Republicans and the Democrats as this was put together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to make that point. We inherited a mess. We have tried to make the most of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This BRAC issue is going to get resolved. I support resolving it. The President is going to ask us for, apparently, $100 billion in the coming couple of weeks.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="BRAC">
    <paragraph>Will the Senator yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="BRAC">
    <paragraph>Let me finish my thought.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is going to ask for $150 billion above that next year with respect to Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The point I am making is this: I understand that not just the Senator from Oklahoma but any number of Senators might come and say: I wish this had been in it, I wish that had been in it. I personally wish a number of items had happened that didn't happen in this continuing resolution. But I was involved in working on it as chairman of the Appropriations Energy and Water Subcommittee. Last year, I was ranking member of the Appropriations Interior Subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That bill didn't get to the floor of the Senate. The Energy and water bill didn't get to the floor of the Senate. The bill that would have carried the BRAC funding didn't get to the floor of the Senate. Why not? Don't blame that on Democrats. We didn't control this Chamber last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I don't come to blame one side or the other. I only come to say we have tried to make the best of a bad situation. We were left with quite a mess. How did we make the best of this? We worked with the House and the Senate--bicameral; we worked with the staff of the Republicans and the staff of the Democrats, bipartisan--to try to see if we could put together something that would allow us to put the fiscal year 2007 appropriations bills behind us and move ahead, because we need to move immediately  now to begin to put together the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bills. We need to do that now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I only make the point that that is why we are here. No one likes it. We have done the best we could to make the best out of a bad situation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, will the Senator yield for a very friendly question?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="BRAC">
    <paragraph>I will be happy to yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="BRAC">
    <paragraph>We had authorized $5.7 billion to be spent this year on the BRAC process and $4.1 billion was taken out, with $1 billion put back. My question to you is: Can we have that made up without taking it out of a supplemental that would be pulling it out of other wartime activities? I would say that probably would work. That is my concern.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="BRAC">
    <paragraph>Madam President, reclaiming my time, it is not going to be taken out of other funding in a supplemental. It will be added to a supplemental, I presume. The President has proposed sending us $250 billion in emergency funding in two tranches, the first for this fiscal year and the second for the next fiscal year. My assumption is that everyone here believes those BRAC funds need to be dealt with and will be dealt with in a supplemental, not by taking it away from other military expenditures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> All time has expired.</chair>

    <paragraph>I ask for the yeas and nays.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I was pleased that today a fellow Pennsylvanian, Nora Barry Fischer, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. I was also happy to help expedite her nomination before the Judiciary Committee to help ensure a speedy consideration by the full Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Fischer is a native of Homestead, PA, and a graduate of Notre Dame Law School. In private practice, she has gained extensive experience in litigation and mediation. Ms. Fischer will bring a wealth of knowledge to the bench, and I am confident that she will serve western Pennsylvania and the Nation well.</paragraph>
