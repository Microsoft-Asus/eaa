  <speaking speaker="300084" topic="RECOGNIZING DIANE REESE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the presentation of the Diane Reese Award to Marilyn J. Smith for her work as the president and cofounder of the Abused Deaf Women's Advocacy Services in Seattle, WA. The presentation took place in the Library of Congress during a major conference on domestic violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This award is much more than recognition of an individual who has gone above and beyond to help those who have and still are suffering from the terrible domestic violence abuses happening daily. This award recognizes a way of life that has inspired and helped countless people that are in need. I would like to commend Marilyn J. Smith for her outstanding work continuing Ms. Reese's compassionate legacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As some of you know, I got my start serving the public when I came to southern West Virginia as a VISTA volunteer. Although Ms. Reese's social justice work started long before her life moving journey to the coalfields of West Virginia, it was that journey that connected both of our lives together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was able to witness firsthand Diane's ability to gracefully build the West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Working with Sue Julian, who still is a team coordinator at the Coalition, they provided the leadership to create a strong program that has grown into a network of shelters, outreach centers, and support groups throughout West Virginia. Diane inspired many thanks to her steady, quiet but fully committed life. Sue and the rest of the coalition continue that work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Visiting the various shelters Diane helped set up in the early 1990s was a very moving opportunity that I feel very fortunate to have experienced. Working closely with Ms. Reese and the coalition, we fought together for the passage of the first Federal Violence Against Women Act and its subsequent reauthorizations. I have continued to work with the coalition and have tried to help with vital Federal grants. Diane, Sue, and the coalition have played a pivotal role in advising me about the Violence  Against Women Act over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In West Virginia, Diane Reese touched the lives of so many with her unique ability to heal and serve those in need. Throughout her years of serving the public, Diane became an adjunct faculty at Southern WV Community College and was an active member in the Mountaineer Food Bank, the Appalachian Research and Defense Fund Board, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, just to name a few. As you can see, Diane certainly went above and beyond the norm with her generosity and charity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last year the West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence that Diane helped to create provided support to over 15,000 people, including children. As you can tell, the numbers of those touched by her life are enormous. Her community organizing efforts, spirit for social justice, and expert skills as an educator made her a good counselor and dear friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I and all the people who knew and worked with her were saddened to lose her, and we mourn her still. But Diane has an extraordinary legacy that lives on in the work of the coalition in West Virginia and the national award that continues to inspire and acknowledge the next generation of advocates. Diane Reese pursued every obstacle she faced with knowledge, kindness, respect, expertise, and conquered each one of them with grace and optimism. Those of us lucky enough to know her personally will  also remember her, and the award in her memory continues to inspire all of us. And, I know that with the great challenges that still face the victims and survivors of domestic violence, Diane would be urging us to continue the work she began and reminding us that the goal of securing peace at home for everyone is a goal upon which we must never give up.</paragraph>
