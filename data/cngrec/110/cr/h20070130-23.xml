    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Barbaro, the winner of the Kentucky Derby, died yesterday. Barbaro was not just any horse. This was a horse who never lost a race. This was a horse who won the Kentucky Derby by 6 1/2  lengths. The last time that was done was in 1946. What a shame it was when he hurt himself and cut short one of the greatest careers in horse racing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And sad as this is, I come to the floor to congratulate the New Bolton Center in Chester County, Pennsylvania, in my congressional district. Dean Richardson and the staff of the New Bolton Center have shown the world what humane and excellent veterinary care looks like. Barbaro and his owners put their trust in the New Bolton Center and hoped for the best over the last 9 months. Sadly, Barbaro didn't make it. But no one doubts that everything that could have been done was done and done well.  Our thanks are due to the staff at the New Bolton Center.</paragraph>
