  <speaking speaker="412240" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support today's energy bill. This is the change we need, for America needs a reliable energy partner, one that is home grown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill restores our Nation's independence and will help to secure our future. It will also stimulate our economy and protect our environment. It will allow for clean, renewable energy and move us away from the dangerous dependency on Arabian oil. It will also decrease our imported oil by 2 million gallons per day. It will create jobs and strengthen our economy as we move towards efficient, clean, and renewable energy resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill answers the question whose side are we on. Do we stand with Big Oil and the past or do we stand with the future?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand with the future and will continue to fight to cut the price of energy and fight hard for the people of Northeast Wisconsin.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
