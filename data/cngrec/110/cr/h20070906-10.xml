  <narrative>CONGRATULATING THE APPALACHIAN STATE MOUNTAINEERS ON THEIR VICTORY OVER THE MICHIGAN WOLVERINES -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10162]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, following Appalachian's upset football win over Michigan, Boone, North Carolina, is no longer a sleepy Blue Ridge mountain town. The representatives from each university responded to last Saturday's contest with class: Appalachian not insufferable in victory; Michigan a gracious loser in defeat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the beneficiaries of this game, Mr. Speaker, are the underdogs, the little guys who are given little or no chance of tasting the spoils of victory. Appalachian's Mountaineers and Michigan's Wolverines will post impressive records during the 2007 season. But Saturday's game, Mr. Speaker, will reinforce the optimism of the proverbial underdog, with the assurance that their chances of achieving victory, albeit remote, are within the realm of possibility, and much is to be said in support of  that conclusion.</paragraph>
