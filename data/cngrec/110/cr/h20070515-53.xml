  <speaking speaker="400024" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I just happened to be on the floor when I heard the last speaker talking about Senate majority leader Harry Reid and condemning his comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have known Senator Reid since I was a high school senior at Valley High School in Las Vegas, Nevada. I don't know a public servant who has devoted more of his life to this country, his State and his community than Senator Harry Reid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I can't account for everything this man has ever said, but to get on the floor of the House of Representatives and condemn a true patriot, somebody who cares passionately about his fellow citizens and somebody that stays awake at night because of the loss of life and limb in Iraq, to condemn that person on the floor of the House of Representatives I think is a disgrace. And if I didn't stand up and say something, I would never forgive myself.</paragraph>
