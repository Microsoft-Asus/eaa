  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, recently six foreign-born extremists, inspired by al Qaeda and its preachers of hate, planned to murder U.S. troops with semiautomatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades. The place, not in Iraq, but the United States Army base at Fort Dix in New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They were knowledgeable and cunning, using one member who delivered pizzas on the base to gain intimate knowledge of the fort. They were also planning to attack a U.S. Naval installation in Philadelphia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before the attack could be unleashed on U.S. troops, the FBI was tipped off to their plans, and they were arrested. Not surprisingly, three of these terrorists were in the country illegally. Two others had green cards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are no longer a safe nation. The dangers of our security are real. We discuss in Congress the war against extreme radicals, but it starts with securing the borders. Because crossing unsecured U.S. borders is very easy. It brings the good, the bad, and the ugly. Because all three groups know that, for political reasons, the Federal Government refuses to protect American citizens by securing our sovereignty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
