  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="REMEMBERING HAWAII'S DON HO">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a remarkable son of Hawaii, entertainment legend, Don Ho. Don's big heart gave out on April 14, in Waikiki. He was 76 years old. On Saturday, May 5, Hawaii bid a fond aloha to Don Ho, during a ceremony on Waikiki Beach in celebration of his life. Thousands of people attended his memorial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Don didn't plan on a career in entertainment. After his college graduation, he served in the U.S. Air Force, attaining the rank of first lieutenant. When  he returned home, he began helping at his mother's quiet neighborhood bar, playing music with friends. That was the beginning of a show business career spanning more than four decades including hit records, motion pictures, television, and sold out performances world-wide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hawaii was still a young State when Don Ho became an international star, and in many ways he helped put Hawaii on the map. In my travels around the world, people always ask me about Don Ho. Don was a big star wherever he went. He even played in Washington, DC, when I was in the House. And I can tell you, it was a big show.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite his stature as an entertainment icon, Don was never too busy to spend a few minutes with his fans; young honeymooners, servicemen and women stationed in the islands, or senior citizens on a dream vacation. He had tremendous charisma and talent and because of that he touched many people. Hawaii has lost a beloved son and he will be sorely missed.</paragraph>
