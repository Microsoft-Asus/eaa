    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5472">H.R. 5472</bill>, a measure to name a post office in honor of our departed colleague and dear friend, Representative Julia Carson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the 46 Members of the House who agreed to support and cosponsor this measure, as well as Senator Bayh for introducing <bill type="s" number="2534">S. 2534</bill>, the Senate companion legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to acknowledge that Representative Meek and Representative David Scott have expressed their support, though they were unable to become official cosponsors of the measure due to its rapid movement out of committee. I would also be remiss if I did not thank the Chair and the ranking member of the full committee, as well as the ranking member and Chair of the subcommittee for considering the bill and reporting it out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Julia Carson was a tremendous human being. She passed away on December 15 after a life devoted to service. And as I pointed out last December, with the solstice upon us, the darkest day of the year, that Julia Carson was a light to everyone she came into contact with and certainly was a beacon in this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>She could be tough, she could be gentle, but she was always effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a tribute to her life and to her service to name this Federal facility after her. And I only speak for myself when I would say, however, that Julia is probably looking in on this, is honored, but asking, why aren't we out helping someone else right now, because that was her life. And I would hope that we all take this moment and this honor to rededicate ourselves to helping others along life's path as this great and wonderful and kind and gentle woman has done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank the Chair and ranking member for their courtesy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400656" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2650 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Street, Indianapolis, Indiana, as the "Julia M. Carson Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Julia May Carson dedicated her life to the service of this country. Her career in public service began in 1972 when she was elected to the Indiana State House of Representatives. This was the first of many victories to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In her long and illustrious career, Julia never lost an election. In 1976, Julia ran for the Indiana State Senate, where she served 14 years. In 1990, she became the Trustee for the Center Township, a post she held for 6 years until she ran for the United States Congress, becoming both the first woman and the first African American to represent Indiana in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a daughter of a single mother who worked as a housekeeper and a graduate of a segregated public school in Indiana, Julia's background was very different from those of her fellow representatives, but in the 10 years she served the Seventh District of Indiana, Julia never forgot her roots. She tried hard to represent the poor and the working class of Indiana, concentrated her energies on women's rights, children's issues, and efforts to reduce homelessness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout most of her time in Congress, Julia battled significant health problems. She finally succumbed to a lifelong struggle with lung cancer in December, 2007 at the age of 69.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In honor of her years of faithful service to her country and to the great State of Indiana, I ask my fellow Members to join me in support of this bill and rename the post office located at 2650 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Street in Indianapolis, Indiana, in honor of her memory and long-lasting accomplishments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Mr. Visclosky for introducing this resolution and express my strong support for this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="5472">H.R. 5472</bill> to designate an Indianapolis postal facility after my late colleague, Congresswoman Julia Carson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Hoosier icon, "Ms. Carson," as her staff and friends admiringly called her, was both loved and respected by her district. She was living proof to them and to all of us that hard work and determination can take you very far in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Carson had persevered through some difficult times in American history, growing up in poverty and segregation, yet she rose up to serve more than 20 years in the Indiana State Legislature and for a decade here in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is fitting that the "Julia M. Carson Post Office Building" would be located on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Street. Like Dr. King, Ms. Carson achieved much for civil rights, leading the drive to award civil rights icon Rosa Parks a Congressional Gold Medal and becoming both the first African American and the first woman to represent Indianapolis in the United States Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is bittersweet today to honor Ms. Carson, as we all wish Julia was still here with us. However, we are blessed to have her grandson, Andre, as a colleague representing the Seventh District of Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to offer my strong support for this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400074" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to be recognized for as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative Carson advocated and represented with distinction Indiana's Seventh Congressional District from 1997 until she passed away in the winter of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first woman and the first African American to represent Indiana's Seventh Congressional District, Congresswoman Carson worked her way up the ranks to be a prominent Member of this body and a friend and confidant to many of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5472">H.R. 5472</bill> was first introduced by Carson's close colleague, Representative Peter Visclosky of Indiana, on February 14, 2008 and was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on March 13, 2008 by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure has the support of over 45 Members of Congress and affords us a chance to recognize and pay tribute before the American public to a woman whose life serves as a testimony to the American dream. Her story is an inspiration to those who face insurmountable odds and reminds us that we live in a country where anything can be accomplished with diligence in one hand and dedication in the other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Julia Carson was born in Louisville, Kentucky on July 8, 1938 to a single teenage mother. Despite her apparent disadvantages, Congresswoman Carson overcame the odds she was dealt by fate and achieved extraordinary goals and objectives by faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a young girl, we learned that Congresswoman Carson shouldered a host of jobs in order to support her family, including waiting tables, delivering newspapers, and serving as a farm hand. In other words, our friend had to work for what she got and had to toil greatly to get where she got.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Julia Carson was first introduced to politics in 1972 when Congressman Andy Jacobs encouraged her to run for the Indiana House of Representatives. She served as a member for 4 years, and then moved on to the Indiana Senate, where she held a seat for 14 years. In 1990, she was elected as a Trustee for Center Township of downtown Indianapolis and was responsible for running the welfare office. Over the course of merely 6 years, Carson managed to take a $20 million debt and turn it into a $6 million  surplus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On November 25, 2007, it was reported that Julia Carson had been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, which took her life. We are certainly at a loss for a dear colleague, and believe me, Julia Carson will be missed by this body.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400177" topic="">
    <paragraph>I'd like to thank the gentleman for yielding his time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I knew Julia Carson for more than 20 years. I served with her in the legislature, and I got to know her very well. She was a great public servant in the Indiana legislature and she was a great public servant in the Congress of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we've had several speakers here today, and I'm not going to repeat everything that they have said, but I would like to leave you with this departing thought about Julia:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Julia had a difficult childhood; she had a difficult life growing up. I have talked to Julia many times about her reaching to the point where she became an elected official in the Indiana Legislature and she actually became a Member of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can't tell you how proud she was to be a Member of this august body. It was the highlight of her life. Other than her family, I don't think there was anything else that she felt better about than becoming a Member of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that one of the biggest honors, and if Julia is looking from above, I know she's got a big smile on her face right now, and to have a post office named in her name would be the highlight of her career. And so it's with a great deal of happiness that I have the opportunity to speak on her behalf to acknowledge her great accomplishments in the Congress of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know about Julia's political points of view, but more importantly, I think I want to leave with this body that she was so proud to be one of the Members of the Congress of the United States. And I know that she would be very proud to have this post office named in her honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to honor one of Indiana's finest, Julia Carson. I knew Julia for more than 20 years, and am a better person for it. She was a dear friend and her spirit will unarguably live on not only in the halls of Congress, but in the neighborhoods of Indianapolis where she touched the lives of so many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased we are able to recognize her by dedicating a post office in her hometown of Indianapolis in her honor. She had an enormous presence in Indianapolis and was always striving to help those in need. Julia embodied the true meaning of a "liberal"--a woman who was always fighting for those without a voice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She championed civil rights and walked alongside Martin Luther King, Jr. fighting for equality. She was to me, and so many others, a true hero. Julia was not only proud to be a Member of Congress and represent the fine people of Indianapolis, but she was constantly amazed at how far she had come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many know, Julia had a difficult upbringing but only used those experiences to strengthen and shape her political views. Julia constantly reminded us all how fortunate we are to be Members of Congress. I am so honored to have known Julia for so many years and to have worked so closely with her.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400074" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my colleague and friend, Julia, was an exemplary woman, a loyal patriot, and a formidable political force. She has also left us with someone who is just as capable as she. And at this time, I would like to recognize our new colleague, and her grandson, the gentleman from Indiana, Representative Carson, for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412258" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Congressman Clay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank my dear friend, Senator Bayh, my colleague, Congressman Visclosky, and the entire Indiana delegation for supporting this important piece of legislation. I also would like to extend my sincere thanks to Subcommittee Chairman Danny Davis and his staff for all  of their work in quickly bringing this bill to the floor for a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today with a heavy heart, but also with an overwhelming sense of gratitude and humility. I am sad that my grandmother, former Congresswoman Julia Carson, is not able to be here on this wonderful occasion, but I am also deeply grateful that my colleagues have chosen to honor my grandmother by authorizing a postal facility in my hometown of Indianapolis, Indiana to be renamed the "Julia Carson Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Carson was many good things to many people in the Indianapolis area. Many will remember her as a staunch advocate for the poor from her years in the Indiana State legislature. Others will perhaps remember her for her efforts in helping needy children receive health care services. But I think, most importantly, many people will just remember her for being who she was, and that was a good person with a kind and caring heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would like to thank again all of my colleagues who were instrumental in bringing this bill to the floor today, and I know that if my grandmother were here, she would thank you all.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in memory of our dear colleague and courageous colleague, let us pass <bill type="h" number="5472">H.R. 5472</bill> and designate the facility of the U.S. Postal Service located at 2650 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Street, Indianapolis, Indiana, as the "Julia M. Carson Post Office Building."</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the designation of the Julia M. Carson Post Office Building in Indianapolis, IN.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Carson was not only a colleague but also a dear friend. It is truly gratifying to me, and surely her family and the constituents of the 7th Congressional District of Indiana, that the House of Representatives would seek to recognize her in this special way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Carson's accomplishments in the House of Representatives are numerous. Most notably, her work to authorize a Congressional Gold Medal for Rosa Parks; sponsorship of an Amtrak reauthorization bill; and passage of language to improve the eligibility requirements for SCHIP, demonstrate her commitment to the needs of underserved people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her book, My Neighbor as Myself, outlines a vision of how she felt we, as public servants, should serve our community. In this book she discussed the plight of our children and the need for "powerful parenting", providing "responsible relief" for the poor, job creation, economic empowerment, and community reentry. She was tireless in her efforts to advocate for people who are rarely able to advocate for themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Julia Carson will certainly be remembered in the halls of Congress for her character, humor, and unyielding commitment to oppressed and impoverished people. It is my hope that the naming of this post office after such a noble and honorable woman will inspire her story to continue to be told.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In years to come, when the children of Indiana ask, "Who was Julia Carson?" may they learn the story of a woman who came from the same neighborhood, overcame the same struggles, and pushed for the rights of all in our Nation's capitol. May they learn of a heroine who accomplished great personal success but always remained mindful of who she was here to serve. I pray that the designation of this post office in the name of my dear friend will provide inspiration to those she worked tirelessly  for in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of a dear friend and respected colleague of mine, Representative Julia Carson, and strongly support the underlying bill, <bill type="h" number="5472">H.R. 5472</bill>, "To designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2650 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Street, Indianapolis, IN, as the "Julia M. Carson Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in poverty and racial segregation to a teenage single mother in 1938, Julia Porter Carson worked her way up through politics to become one of the most influential people in central Indiana. Julia Carson had a long career as a public servant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1965, while working as a secretary at UAW Local 550, she was hired away by newly elected congressman Andy Jacobs to do casework in his Indianapolis office. When his own electoral prospects looked dim in 1972, he encouraged Carson to run for the Indiana State House of Representatives, which she did; she was elected in 1972, serving as a member for 4 years. In 1976, she successfully ran for the Indiana State Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1990, she was elected as a trustee for Center Township that covers downtown Indianapolis, and was responsible for running welfare programs in central Indianapolis. Carson served 6 years as a trustee, creating a $6-million surplus from the office's $20-million debt. Carson employed an aggressive workfare program and anti-fraud procedures to quickly erase the enormous debt, while still providing much needed emergency services to the poor of Indianapolis. Her budget-balancing feat earned compliments  from both sides of the political spectrum, including that of republican county auditor John Von Arx, who said, "Julia Carson wrestled that monster to the ground."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1996, Julia Carson made history by becoming the first African-American woman Indiana has ever sent to Congress. Despite all her accomplishments and success, she never forgot her roots; she always remained true to herself and her beliefs. With all her success and accomplishments, she could have moved to a better neighborhood but chose not to. To the day she died, Julia Carson's home telephone number was in the Indianapolis phone book.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In all my years in Congress, I am not sure I can remember anyone as dedicated to their constituents as Julia was. She reached out to senior citizens, mothers of men and women serving in Iraq, crime victims and those struggling to pay the rent. She sent cards and routinely showed up at funerals and hospitals and front doors. She worked to find work for young men who were coming out of prison. She helped crime victims who were seeking justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I didn't always agree with Julia politically, I always enjoyed working with her and her welcoming smile. She was a great woman and a dedicated public servant. While I was lucky to serve with her in this body, I was luckier to call her my friend. It is right that we honor her in the community that she served by naming this post office in her memory.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5472">H.R. 5472</bill>, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2650 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Street, Indianapolis, IN, as the "Julia M. Carson Post Office Building," introduced by my distinguished colleague from Indiana, Representative PETER VISCLOSKY. Through this important resolution, the House of Representatives will give final tribute to our colleague, sister, mentor and friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of this House, I have been privileged to work with some extraordinary men and women. Julia Carson was an extraordinary woman and an extraordinary champion of justice and equality. Julia Carson was a powerful force for change in this country and was an articulate champion for the poor, homeless and those who suffered from discrimination and racial injustice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the first woman and first African-American elected to represent Indianapolis in Congress, Julia truly represented and will be remembered as an American hero. Julia was so keenly committed to those who could not speak for themselves and could not help themselves. A longtime legislator in the Indiana State Legislature and advocate for her community, Julia's history, by its very nature, directed her to the fight for those who, like herself, grew up with very little, but yet could look to this  great country and actually believe that they could achieve their dreams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Julia Carson who grew up poor and lived through segregation was elected in 1996 to the U.S. House of Representatives. Among many, one of her biggest achievements came in 1999 when she successfully pushed through legislation granting the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks, the mother of the civil rights movement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Julia Carson lived her life to the fullest extent. She left few stones unturned. Her passion for family and community was unparallel. Though she was only a member of this body for 11 years, her life and legacy will last an eternity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative Carson was a true advocate for and of the people. For over 35 years she worked tirelessly for her community and she was the greatest example of humility, self-determination, fortitude, strength and resilience. She will always be remembered for her advocacy of the most disadvantaged and she will truly be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is because of the legacy of Congresswoman Julia Carson that I rise today in support of the naming the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2650 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Street, Indianapolis, IN, as the "Julia M. Carson Post Office Building". Though Julia is no longer with us, we can still honor her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we must never forget the life and legacy of a woman who touched the hearts and minds of so many. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support designating the post office located at 2650 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Street, INndianapolis, IN, as the Julia M. Carson Post Office Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past December, my friend and colleague, Julia Carson, lost her battle with cancer. She had devoted her life to public service and her loss is still felt greatly. Congresswoman Carson was an extraordinary person, and a woman of principle who unabashedly championed the issues in which she believed. Her constituents and the Nation have lost a great legislator and an outstanding leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Carson made history in 1996 by becoming the first woman and the first African-American Indianapolis has ever sent to Congress. And she came to Congress with one mission--to improve the lives of the people of her community. Even as she rose to a position of prominence in this body, she never forgot the people she was sent here to serve. She truly dedicated her career to them--and for that, earned the respect and gratitude of all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since her days in the Indiana State Senate, Congresswoman Carson was committed to helping seniors live with independence and dignity as they age. Throughout her career, she has provided exceptional leadership and devoted service to America's senior citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Carson was also a strong proponent of civil rights movement, scaling the barriers imposed by poverty and sexism. She was a leader in advocating for voting rights, and worked diligently for the health and income needs of people experiencing homelessness and families at risk of homelessness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today her grandson continues her legacy here within the House of Representatives. I know that this honor is very meaningful to the Carson family and to her constituents in the 7th District of Indiana, and I'm certain if Julia were here today she would be touched as well. This post office designation is a fitting honor for a woman so dedicated to public service, and I fully support this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my late great friend Congresswoman Julia M. Carson, a dedicated public servant from Indianapolis. I thank my colleague, Congressman Visclosky, for introducing a resolution to recognize her achievements by naming a post office in her honor in Indianapolis as the Julia M. Carson Post Office Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Julia Carson was born on July 8, 1938 in Louisville, Kentucky and served in various elected offices. We first became colleagues when she was elected to the 105th Congress and served together until she passed away on December 15, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the first African American and first woman to be elected to Congress from Indianapolis, Julia Carson was a woman of outstanding ambition and achievements. Not only was Julia a star in her city of Indianapolis, but she was a star of the nation. Her many invaluable legislative contributions, including the recognition of Rosa Parks with a Congressional Gold Medal, were a testament to her star qualities. I hope that my colleagues realize what we lost when Julia passed away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I can think of no one more deserving of this enduring recognition than Julia Carson. This resolution is fitting recognition for a tremendous woman who continued to deliver the truth until her final days. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution as we can all attest to her unprecedented devotion in serving her community and society.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of 5471, naming a U.S. Post Office the "Julia M. Carson Post Office Building." It is fitting and right that we recognize and honor the extraordinary life of our dear friend and former colleague Julia May Carson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also fitting that the Julia Carson building will be located at 2650 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Street in Indianapolis, Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like Dr. King, Congresswoman Carson championed the rights of the underprivileged, the underrepresented and the overlooked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many people in Indiana and many of us in Congress need no help to remember the great woman that Julia Carson was or what her service meant to her community and the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We came to depend on her determined leadership and commitment throughout her tenure in Congress. She was a true voice for the voiceless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that her legacy will be carried on through the work of her grandson, the newest member of Congress, Andr&#xE9; Carson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Naming this post office after Julia is the least that we can do to mark her dedication and service to the people of Indianapolis and a grateful nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her loyalty and her patriotism, her service and her love of our country will never be forgotten. I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="5472">H.R. 5472</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5472">H.R. 5472</bill>, which designates the post office at 2650 Martin Luther King, Jr. Street, Indianapolis, Indiana as the "Julia M. Carson Post Office Building" in honor of my friend and former colleague, Congresswoman Julia Carson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Julia Carson was a tireless representative of the people of Indiana who served them from her position as a congressional aide in the 1960s to two terms in the Indiana House of Representatives to service in the Indiana Senate from 1976 to 1990. She vigorously pursued issues related to the needs of working men and women, public health, the environment, and fundamental justice. When the AIDS epidemic broke out, Mrs. Carson was one of the early champions of the right of the sick to be treated fairly  as she worked to bring public understanding about the new illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a victim herself of discrimination in health care, which delayed the diagnosis and treatment of her heart disease, she was an ardent advocate for the elimination of all health disparities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Julia Carson coupled her career in public service with a 10-year stint in corporate America. As Marion County Center Township Trustee in 1990, she saved the financially floundering office, earning the accolade of Indianapolis Woman of the Year from the Indianapolis Star for the second time in her career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Julia Carson came to Congress in 1996 and brought the same energy and enthusiasm to this body to which her constituents in Indiana had grown accustomed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Congresswoman, Julia Carson was proud of her vote against the Iraq War, her legislation that awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor to Rosa Parks, and her tireless advocacy for women, children, the homeless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After more than 40 years of service to the people of her district and the State of Indiana and indeed to the country as a whole, I join my colleagues in their overwhelming support of the Indianapolis post office being named in her honor.</paragraph>
