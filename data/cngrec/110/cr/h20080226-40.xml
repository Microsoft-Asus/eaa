  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the men and women in our intelligence agencies are facing uncertainty. They are telling us this, and that is posing a ver y real national security risk to us in our homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I rise to encourage this House to close the terrorist loophole for good by passing a bill that would permanently update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate passed this bipartisan bill with 68 votes. The House leadership will not bring it to the floor. They had another opportunity today, and they passed on that opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, time has run out. The Protect America Act has expired. The Democratic leadership of the  House has had more than 6 months to tackle this problem. They continue to delay. Let's not delay another day. Let's bring our intelligence capabilities into the 21st century. Let's pass the Protect America Act now.</paragraph>
