  <narrative>REAUTHORIZE SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11852]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, President Bush and about 10 House Republicans are all that stand between 10 million children and the health care they need and deserve. I am deeply disappointed in the President's dumbfounding veto of the SCHIP bill. He reneged on his pledge he made when running for re-election in 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill to reauthorize SCHIP continues coverage for 6 million kids currently covered and provides incentives for another 4 million kids who have been falling through the cracks of the health care system. The program continues to focus on low- and moderate-income families who earn too much for the Medicaid program, but can't afford private health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the big momentum behind this historic bill is growing exponentially and will not be stopped. To those blocking the SCHIP reauthorization from becoming law, I say either get on board, get out of the way, or get run over. The children's health care bill is on its way, either with or without you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SCHIP supporters are even more determined than ever to get this done by the mid-November deadline. Let's all finish this job. For children's health care in America, it's fourth and goal on the 1-yard line. Working together, we can overpower anyone left blocking the way.</paragraph>
