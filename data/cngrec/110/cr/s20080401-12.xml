  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor once again to urge my colleagues to begin serious work that is needed to address the housing crisis. The news keeps getting worse. Home prices continue to decline steeply. Home sales are reaching record lows, and the resulting shock to our broader financial system keeps getting worse. In the 2 weeks since we adjourned, we saw the Federal Reserve act to bail out a major investment bank by facilitating the purchase of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan. This  marked the first time in history the Fed had acted to rescue a financial institution of this kind. It did so because of the impact a Bear Stearns collapse would have had on the entire economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, it was reported home prices in the 20 largest metropolitan statistical areas suffered their largest drop in history, over 10 percent in 1 year. In some cities, such as Miami, Las Vegas, and Phoenix, the drop is as high as 18 or 19 percent. Yet because of the Republican filibuster in this Chamber 2 weeks ago, the Senate has failed to act to deliver meaningful solutions to this crisis which is at the center of the economic storm pummeling the middle class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we look at the headlines, they keep coming: From USA Today, "Battered Home Prices Keep Toppling;" from the New York Times, "Slump Moves from Wall Street to Main Street;" from the Wall Street Journal, "Housing, Bank Troubles Deepen;" from the Washington Post, "Mortgage Foreclosures Reach All-Time High."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We voted on the Foreclosure Prevention Act several weeks ago. The bad news since then has, in fact, gotten worse. This is a scene all too familiar across the States. All across America families are feeling the pain of the housing crunch. Price-reduced homes are on sale because they have been foreclosed upon. It is not just families who are being foreclosed upon; it is their neighbors whose home values have declined steeply as a result of foreclosures in the neighborhood. Again, it was reported  last week that home prices in the 20 major metropolitan areas declined over 10 percent between January of 2007 and January of 2008. Price reduced, price reduced, price reduced--that is not a sign any homeowner wants to see on their lawn or on their neighbor's lawn or on their street. These are not just families who found themselves in financial</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next chart demonstrates how widespread the problem has become in my own State of Colorado. These are figures from the Center for Responsible Lending which has projected that we can expect to see troubles ahead in terms of the continuing tide of foreclosures over the next several years and how these foreclosures will affect not only owners of the foreclosed homes but entire neighborhoods and, in fact, most homeowners across the State of Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Center for Responsible Lending projects that in Colorado we will experience nearly 50,000 additional foreclosed homes in 2008 and 2009, as the adjustable rate mortgages reset and as home values continue to plummet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As stated on this chart, which is a map of my wonderful State of Colorado, we see expected foreclosures are going to be right at about 50,000. The spillover impact for surrounding homes that will suffer decline during that same period is almost 750,000 homes. That is more than a third of the homes of the State of Colorado are going to see this declining spiral. We are going to see a decline in home values in the aggregate of $3.2 billion in my State in the loss of home ownership value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The situation is clearly getting worse. Many middle-class families whose budgets are already stretched thin cannot afford such a steep decline in the value of their most important asset. Congress has a responsibility to act aggressively to help families stay in their homes and to stem the tide of foreclosures that continues to serve as a serious drag on our overall economy. That is why we are here again today, working to move on the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, legislation introduced by  Senator Reid, in consultation with the chairs of the committees of jurisdiction. That legislation would take several steps to provide meaningful and immediate assistance to families and communities affected by foreclosures and to prevent other families and communities from finding themselves in the same situation in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation does three simple things. First, it seeks to help families facing foreclosure to stay in their homes by expanding State authority to issue tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, increasing funding for credit counseling, and allowing bankruptcy judges to restructure mortgages. Second, it provides critical help to communities across the country that have been affected by foreclosure by increasing funding under the Community Development Block Grant program. Third, it takes steps to help  families and communities avoid foreclosures in the future by requiring simplicity and transparency on mortgage documents. I am especially glad these provisions are included in the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The two tax-related provisions reported out of the Finance Committee on a bipartisan basis as part of the bipartisan economic stimulus proposal represent important steps that provide low-interest loans to homeowners seeking to refinance their mortgages and to allow ailing businesses, including those in the home construction industry, to carry back their losses a longer period of time to average out their good and bad years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also support funding increases for credit counseling, which will go a long way toward helping families understand the financial burdens associated with taking out a long-term home loan and to avoid foreclosure. In my State of Colorado, we have already seen how beneficial these kinds of services can be. Last fall, a consortium of government, private sector, and nonprofit organizations launched the Colorado foreclosure hotline which connects borrowers with nonprofit housing counselors who can  provide information on a borrower's options when facing foreclosure. Counselors can facilitate communications between lenders and borrowers. The hotline itself has already  received over 10,000 calls in the last 6 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a sign from the foreclosure hotline in Colorado. Since it was first formed, this consortium between the government, the private sector, and nonprofit organizations, more than 29,000 people in Colorado have called this hotline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will go a long way toward helping us implement this kind of program all the way across the country. The American dream of home ownership is today a dream which is becoming nebulous for the people of our country because of the huge foreclosure crisis we have seen across the country which has caused such a decline in home values all across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe it is our responsibility in the Senate to move forward to provide relief to these middle-class families who are in danger of losing value in their homes and in danger of losing their homes. This is an economic stimulus program which I think is timely for us to act upon. I hope our colleagues will join us in voting aye on the motion to proceed to the housing legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
