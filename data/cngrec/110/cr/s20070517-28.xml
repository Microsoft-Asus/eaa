    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the pecan growers of New Mexico for being No. 1 in the Nation in pecan production. This is the first time New Mexico has claimed this title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The recently released preliminary numbers from last year indicate that New Mexico growers produced 46 million pounds of pecans valued at $86.1 million. This is 6 million more pounds of pecans than second-ranked Georgia and 10 million more pounds than third-ranked Texas. This is quite an achievement given the size of the pecan industry in both Georgia and Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of New Mexico's pecan growers and their hard work. I am sure this will not be the last time they take this title, and I wish them luck this season.</paragraph>
