  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="Introducing S. 2683. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to modify certain authorities relating to educational assistance benefits for veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2683">S. 2683</bill>] Mr. President, I am introducing today the proposed GI Bill Miscellaneous Improvements Act of 2008. This measure would make three minor but important changes in existing law relating to veterans' educational assistance programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2001, Public Law 107-103 established a program of accelerated payments for individuals enrolled in high-cost programs of educational assistance leading to employment in high technology industry. It is generally agreed that the intent of that legislation was that payments were to be effective with respect to short, non-degree programs of education. For example, Senate Report 107-86 stated:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Microsoft, Cisco, and other technical training for certification is offered through training centers, private contractors to community colleges, or by the companies themselves. These courses often last just a few weeks or months, and can cost many thousands of dollars .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the Committee's June 28th hearing, Dr. Leo Mackay, Deputy Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, testified that "providing educational benefits for pursuit of these [technology] courses is fully  consonant with MGIB purposes." David Tucker, Senior Associate Legislative Director of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, also testified that, "If the MGIB is to be used not only for recruitment purposes, but also as a means of enabling a veteran  to make a smooth transition back to civilian life, then <bill type="s" number="1088">S. 1088</bill> [allowing veterans to use their MGIB benefits in courses leading to certification in technical fields] is a vital means to accomplish these goals."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As enacted, however, the payments are made to individuals pursuing any courses in the high technology sector including associate and degree programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation I am introducing would correct this oversight prospectively, while holding harmless those individuals who might be receiving accelerated payments for degree programs at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Public Law 107-103 also expanded the scope of work that could be assigned to individuals participating in VA work study programs. Specifically, it added to acceptable activities certain outreach services programs, activities relating to hospital and domiciliary care to veterans in State homes, and activities relating to the administration of national or state veterans' cemeteries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As enacted, this expansion of scope was initially made available until December 31, 2006. Public Law 109-461 extended the scope expansion until June 30, 2007. Since legislation extending the scope expansion was stalled in Congress, there was a disruption in the provision of these important activities until Public Law 110-157, enacted on December 26, 2007, extended this expansion until June 30, 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My proposal would make this activity expansion permanent so that the unfortunate disruption that occurred this year will not occur in the future. I note that this provision does not affect the number of VA work study positions that may be made available. It only addresses the type of activities that may be carried out under the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this bill would authorize appropriations for VA payments to State Approving Agencies. Under provisions of chapter 36 of title 38, U.S. Code, VA contracts for the services of State approving agencies--SAAs--for the purpose of approving programs of education at institutions of higher learning, apprenticeship programs, on-job training programs, and other programs. SAAs are also tasked with assisting VA with various outreach activities to inform eligible VA program participants of the educational  assistance benefits to which they are entitled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1988, VA payment for the services of SAAs has been made only out of funds available for readjustment benefits, a mandatory funding account, and has thus been subject to funding caps. Section 3674(a)(4) of title 38, U.S. Code, states as follows: "The total amount made available under this section for any fiscal year may not exceed $13,000,000 or, for fiscal year 2007, $19,000,000." Thus, under existing law, the cap on the amount of funds that could be made available in fiscal years 2008  and beyond would revert to funding levels applied prior to fiscal year 2000--or a reduction of more than 32 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A provision in <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill> that would restore the $19 million cap on funding is currently pending in the Senate, and a $19 million funding level was provided for through the appropriations process. However, the measure I am introducing would look beyond this fiscal year and address the needs of the program in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By authorizing appropriations for the SAAs, I believe that the program will be able to justify increases in the current funding level beyond the $19 million level to which they would be restricted for all fiscal years going forward. Further, I believe that the current cap on funding, although to some appearing attractive because it seems to offer some stability by pulling from the mandatory funding readjustment benefits account, actually offers no such stability as VA could at any time determine  that $2 million "does not exceed" $19 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am committed to seeking an adequate level of funding for the important activities of the SAAs and believe that this approach would assist in achieving that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="Introducing S. 2684. A bill to reform the housing choice voucher program under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2684">S. 2684</bill>] Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce with my colleagues Senators SCHUMER, REED, MENENDEZ and BROWN, the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2008, a bill to improve our Nation's largest initiative to assist low-income families afford housing. Section 8 housing vouchers help 2 million American families--including many children, seniors and people with disabilities--afford safe, decent and stable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current crisis in the U.S. housing market is having ripple effects throughout our Nation. Families are losing their homes--both homeowners and renters whose properties are being foreclosed upon. Those who can hold onto their homes have seen significant losses in equity, and many owe more on their mortgage than the value of their home. This crisis in the housing sector is causing a significant slowdown in our economy, and housing assistance will need to be strengthened so families have access  to safe, affordable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without housing assistance, many families would lack the stability to find and retain employment, and many children would be unable to adequately perform in school because of multiple moves or health problems resulting from inadequate housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though millions of families are assisted through housing programs, the need for additional housing opportunities is acute. The Joint Center for Housing Studies found that last year the number of severely cost-burdened households, those that pay more than half of their income towards rent, jumped by 1.2 million to a total of 17 million. This is one in seven U.S. households that struggle to afford housing without foregoing other basic needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Housing vouchers are a successful way to provide stability for millions of Americans. Through this public-private partnership, vouchers allow low-&#xD0;income, working Americans to live closer to employment and educational opportunities, and nearer to social and familial networks and support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While housing vouchers are a critical tool, the program needs to be updated  so that additional families can benefit, and so that taxpayer dollars are spent more efficiently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The voucher reform bill that I am introducing today will help attract additional private landlords, reduce administrative burdens, and help more families achieve self-sufficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill creates a stable and efficient formula for allocating voucher funds so that families do not lose their housing. Under this formula, housing agencies are encouraged to lower the costs per voucher, helping to create efficiencies in the program and allowing more people to access needed housing opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill encourages employment by allowing voucher holders to keep more of their earnings, while ensuring that they pay fair rents. Systematic funding is provided for Family Self-Sufficiency coordinators so that more families can access this successful program aimed at increasing earnings and saving for homeownership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill authorizes 20,000 additional incremental housing vouchers to help meet the great and growing demand for assistance from low-income working families, seniors, and people with disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill, administrative burdens are eased, so that housing agencies spend less time and funding on paperwork, and more time and funding on assisting families in need. To more effectively use program resources, the bill requires unit inspections every 2 years instead of annually. While the bill retains the requirement that tenants pay 30 percent of their income towards rent, it streamlines and standardizes the calculation of income so that housing agencies can rely on standard, as opposed  to individualized, income deductions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will greatly improve the voucher program, and I am pleased to be sponsoring this legislation. It has support from more than 80 local and national groups, including the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the National Alliance to End Homelessness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a strong and needed bill, and I urge my colleagues to support our efforts to provide additional affordable housing opportunities to low-income families all across our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, a list of supporters, and a section-by-section analysis be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

A public housing agency making assistance payments pursuant to this clause for a dwelling unit shall, 30 days  after the beginning of the period for which such payments are made, suspend any assistance payments for the unit if any deficiency resulting in noncompliance with the housing quality standards has not been corrected by such time, and may not resume such payments until each such deficiency has been corrected.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(iii) PROJECTS RECEIVING CERTAIN FEDERAL HOUSING SUBSIDIES.--In the case of any property that within the previous 12 months has been determined to meet Federal housing quality and safety standards under any Federal housing program inspection standard equivalent to the standards under the program under this subsection, including the program under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or under subtitle A of title II of the Cranston Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, a  public housing agency may--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(I) authorize occupancy before the inspection under clause (i) has been completed; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(II) make assistance payments retroactive to the beginning of the lease term after the unit has been determined pursuant to an inspection under clause (i) to meet the housing quality standards under subparagraph (B), provided that such inspection is conducted pursuant to the requirements of subparagraph (C).";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) by striking subparagraph (D) and inserting the following new subparagraph:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(D) BIENNIAL INSPECTIONS.--</narrative>

  <narrative> There is authorized to be appropriated the amount necessary for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2013 to provide public housing agencies with incremental tenant-based assistance under section 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)) sufficient to assist 20,000 incremental dwelling units in each such fiscal year. A preference for allocation of such incremental tenant-based assistance, as part of the competitive process required by section 213(d) of the Housing and Community  Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 1439(d)), is to be given to (1) preserving affordable housing, including State public housing, and other housing that needs operating support in order to remain affordable, and (2) entities that are providing voucher assistance on a regional basis. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 22.

  <narrative> Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2008 (SEVRA)</narrative>
  <narrative> Section 1. Short title </narrative>
  <narrative>Short title identifying the bill as the "Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2008."</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 2. Inspection of dwelling units </narrative>
  <narrative>Makes a number of changes to the inspection requirements for housing units rented to Section 8 voucher holders. Retains the initial inspection requirement, except permits occupancy and payments to be made for up to 30 days if a unit fails inspection as a result only of non-life threatening conditions. In such case, payments must be suspended after 30 days if the deficiencies are not corrected. Also allows a PHA to permit occupancy prior to inspection if another federal program inspection has  been made within the preceding 12 months.</narrative>
  <narrative>Properties will be required to be re-inspected at least every two years instead of annually. Permits use of inspections under a federal, state, or local housing assistance program in lieu of a public housing agency (PHA) voucher inspection. Requires a PHA to conduct an interim inspection within 15 days after a tenant notifies the PHA that a unit is out of compliance and within 24 hours in the case of a life threatening condition.</narrative>
  <narrative>If a property fails an inspection and the failure is not corrected within 30 days, the PHA is required to abate assistance for up to 120 days, and the PHA may use abated assistance to repair life-threatening conditions. Requires a PHA to terminate its contract with the owner at the end of the abatement period if the unit is not repaired, and to notify the tenant that they have 120 days to find new housing beginning at the start of the abatement period. Requires that PHAs provide reasonable assistance  to the displaced tenant, including the use of up to two months of abated assistance for relocation expenses, and if necessary give the tenant additional time to search for a unit or, at the tenant's option, preference for the next available public housing unit.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 3. Rent reform and income reviews </narrative>
  <narrative>Recertification. Modifies the annual certification requirement for the Section 8 voucher and project-based assistance programs and for public housing to permit PHAs and owners to recertify fixed-income families every three years. Requires interim recertifications only if annual income increases by $1,000 or more, or at a family's request if its income falls by $1,000 or more.</narrative>
  <narrative>Simplification. Simplifies the rent calculation process for the Section 8 voucher and project-based assistance programs and for public housing so that there is more reliance on standardized deductions. Raises the standard deduction for elderly and disabled families from $400 to $700 a year, and indexes that amount and the $480 dependent standard deduction for inflation in subsequent years. Allows deduction of unreimbursed child care expenses above 5 percent of annual income and raises the threshold  for calculating medical and handicapped assistance expense deductions from counting such expenses over 3 percent to over 10 percent of income. Contains administrative simplification provisions, including relieving PHAs of the responsibility to maintain records of HUD-required income exclusions, creating safe harbor for reliance on other governmental income determinations (eg., Medicaid, TANF), and eliminating the need to calculate any imputed return on assets.</narrative>
  <narrative>Work and Education Incentives: To help provide incentives for employment and earnings, a family's prior year's income is used to calculate its rent obligation and the first 10% of the first $9,000 of earned income is excluded from the income calculation. Exempts income of minors (except for heads of households or their spouses) and of adult dependents that are full time students, and exempts grant-in-aid or scholarship amounts used for tuition or books.</narrative>
  <narrative>Impact on Public Housing Revenues. Requires HUD to provide additional public housing operating funds to public housing agencies whose rental income declines by more than one half of a percent as a result of the rent reforms in the bill, subject to the availability of funds. Also requires HUD to submit to Congress, a report identifying and calculating the impact of rent reforms on public housing costs and revenues.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 4. Eligibility for assistance based on assets and income </narrative>
  <narrative>To better target assistance, prohibits any family from receiving assistance if they have more than $100,000 in net assets or an ownership in a residence suitable for occupancy. Excludes from this a number of assets including homeownership equity accounts and family self-sufficiency accounts, necessary items of personal property, retirement and education savings account assets, and amounts from certain disability-related lawsuits. Also excludes properties owned by victims of domestic violence  and properties owned by families making a good faith effort to sell. Allows flexibility by permitting PHAs to elect not to enforce limits for public housing residents, and PHAs and project-based owners may delay eviction or termination of families not meeting asset restrictions for up to six months.</narrative>
  <narrative>Extends the 80% of local area median income limitation that applies to initial occupancy to apply on an ongoing basis (determined at periodic recertification). PHAs and owners may elect not to enforce this income limitation for residents of public housing or project-based Section 8 units, and PHAs and owners may delay eviction or termination for up to six months.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 5. Targeting vouchers to low income working families </narrative>
  <narrative>To address needs in very-low income areas, allows the higher of 30% of area median income or the national poverty level to be used as the income threshold for extremely-low income families.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 6. Voucher funding renewal </narrative>
  <narrative>Authorizes such sums as may be necessary for Fiscal Years 2009 through 2013 for the renewal of expiring Section 8 vouchers, and for new tenant protection, enhanced vouchers, and other special purpose vouchers.</narrative>
  <narrative>Stabilizes the voucher renewal formula to provide adequate and predictable funding each year. The voucher funding allocation shall be re-calculated each year, based on a PHA's leasing and  cost data from the prior calendar year. Such calculation is adjusted for an annual inflation factor as well as the first time renewal of incremental, tenant protection and enhanced vouchers; for vouchers set aside for project-based assistance; for vouchers ported in the prior year; and for such other adjustments as HUD considers appropriate, including adjustments for  natural and other major disasters. PHAs are provided incentives to bring down voucher</narrative>
  <narrative>To ensure funds are available when there are market or program income fluctuations, PHAs may retain reserves equal to one eighth (12.5%, or  1/2  months) of their annual allocation at the end of 2008, 7.5 percent at the end of 2009, and 5% in each succeeding year. To implement the limitation on reserve funds, at the end of each year, HUD is required to reduce a PHA's funding allocation for the following year to offset excess reserves. HUD is required to make available all savings from such offsets  to cover increased costs related to portability and family self-sufficiency escrow accounts, and for reallocation to PHAs for increased voucher leasing and to reward good performance. If a PHA has reserves of less than 2%, it can receive an advance of up to 2% in the last three months of a year to cover overages, which it "repays" through an offsetting funding reduction in the next year's funding allocation.</narrative>
  <narrative>Provides for proration if overall funding is insufficient to meet nationwide costs, except that enhanced vouchers shall be fully funded. HUD is required to allocate all funds by the later of February 15th or 45 days after enactment of the appropriations bill funding renewals.</narrative>
  <narrative>Tenant protection vouchers </narrative>
  <narrative>Portability </narrative>
  <narrative>Vouchers for people with disabilities </narrative>
  <narrative>Section 7. Administrative fees </narrative>
  <narrative>Continues the current practice setting voucher administrative fees based on the number of vouchers in use and retains the Fiscal Year 2003 per unit fee as a baseline (adjusted for inflation) unless HUD establishes a new formula for calculating per unit fees by regulation.</narrative>
  <narrative>Family self sufficiency </narrative>
  <narrative>Section 8. HOMEOWNERSHIP </narrative>
  <narrative>This section continues the voucher homeownership program and permits voucher funds to be used for a down payment for first-time homebuyers, up to $10,000.</narrative>
  <narrative>Facilitates use of vouchers for the full cost of purchasing manufactured homes sited on leased land, by permitting voucher funds to be used for both the cost of leasing the land plus monthly home purchase costs, including property taxes, insurance, and tenant-paid utilities.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 9 Performance assessments </narrative>
  <narrative>The section ensures that PHAs are administering their voucher programs effectively by requiring HUD to assess voucher administration. Under this section, assessment must include the quality of units assisted, utilization of allocated funds and authorized vouchers, timeliness and accuracy of reporting to HUD, reasonableness of rent burdens, accurate rent and utility calculations and subsidy payments, effectiveness in carrying out family self-sufficiency activities, timeliness of actions related  to landlord participation, and other factors as the HUD Secretary considers appropriate. Assessments must be conducted biannually, with results provided to Congress and the public as well as to PHAs. HUD must establish by regulation the procedures to be followed to bring poor performing agencies into compliance.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 10. PHA project-based assistance </narrative>
  <narrative>To facilitate housing development, this section increases the maximum project-based voucher contract term from 10 to 15 years to be consistent with the underwriting period for the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program and also provides that rents for project-based vouchers shall not be reduced by virtue of being used in conjunction with Low-Income Housing Tax Credits.</narrative>
  <narrative>This section increases the percentage of vouchers a PHA can project-base from 20% to 25%, with authority to go a further 5% higher to serve homeless people. This section also increases the percentage of vouchers that can be project-based in any project (rather than building) to the greater of 25 dwelling units or 25% of the units in the project, with authority to go up to 40% in areas where vouchers are hard to use. Maintains an exception to this limitation for units specifically made available  for elderly and disabled families or populations with special needs receiving comprehensive services, and adds an exception for single family properties with no more than four dwelling units.</narrative>
  <narrative>Allows a PHA to transfer vouchers and budget authority to other PHAs in the same or adjacent metropolitan areas or counties, to provide project-based assistance that will promote mobility and increase housing and economic opportunities. Directs HUD to encourage such transfers and promptly carry out funding and contract modifications needed to implement them.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 11. Rent burdens </narrative>
  <narrative>Requires HUD to monitor voucher rent burdens and submit an annual report to Congress on the percentage of families nationwide paying more than 30% and 40% of their adjusted income for rent. Requires HUD to submit an annual report to Congress on the degree to which voucher families of particular racial and ethnic groups are clustered in lower-rent, higher poverty areas, and what can be done to achieve greater geographic distribution.</narrative>
  <narrative>Requires PHAs to make information on local rent burdens and poverty concentrations available to the public. If the percentage of voucher families paying more than 40% of income for rent exceeds 5%, or families of particular racial and ethnic groups are concentrated in higher poverty areas, the PHA must either raise the payment standard or explain why payment standards are not being raised. HUD is required to approve requests to raise payment standards in such circumstances up to 120% of FMR,  if the PHA has conducted a thorough review of its payment standards and rent reasonableness procedures and taken a series of other steps to ease rent burdens and expand housing opportunities. As a reasonable accommodation for a person with a disability, a PHA may increase payment standards up to 120% of the FMR without approval from HUD, and HUD may approve requests for payment standards above 120% of the FMR.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 12. Establishment of fair market rent </narrative>
  <narrative>To ensure that Fair Market Rents (FMRs) are accurate, this section requires separate FMRs for each metropolitan city with over 40,000 rental units and each county (except counties that are located entirely within metropolitan cities with over 40,000 rental units or in the New England states).</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 13. Screening of applicants </narrative>
  <narrative>This section ensures fair decisions about program eligibility by limiting a PHA's elective screening of applicants to criteria that directly relate to an applicant's ability to fulfill the obligations of the lease, while retaining the ability of a PHA to deny eligibility based on criminal background and reasons relating to safety and security. Applicants and current participants are required to be notified of the basis of any determination of ineligibility, and are to be provided an informal  hearing to present mitigating circumstances in such cases.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 14. Enhanced vouchers </narrative>
  <narrative>This section ensures that families can remain in their housing, by providing that families may receive enhanced vouchers in the case of a property prepayment or opt-out even if they reside in oversized units, except that such tenants may be required to move to appropriate sized units and provides that families eligible for enhanced vouchers are not required to requalify under the PHA's selection standards. Directs HUD to issue implementing regulations within six months after the bill is enacted.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 15. Project-based preservation vouchers </narrative>
  <narrative>Authorizes provision of project-based vouchers in lieu of enhanced vouchers (which are provided as continued housing assistance where an owner prepays a HUD-insured mortgage or upon the termination of a Section 8 contract), at the request of a project owner and a determination by the PHA that the building is economically viable and assisted units in the building will be in significant demand or will further community goals. Families otherwise eligible for enhanced vouchers will be eligible for  preservation project-based vouchers. Such preservation project-based vouchers are similar to other project-based voucher assistance except they are not counted against the limit on the share of a PHA's voucher assistance that may be project-based, and are exempt from the limit on the share of units in a building that may be assisted with project-based vouchers.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 16. Demonstration program waiver authority </narrative>
  <narrative>HUD is authorized to enter into agreements with the Social Security Administration and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to allow for participation in state demonstration programs designed to permit persons with significant disabilities to be employed and continue to receive a range of federal benefits. HUD is authorized to permit a partial or complete disregard of increases in earned income for persons participating in any such demonstration for the purpose of  calculating  rent contributions for housing assisted by Section 8 vouchers.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 17. Study to identify obstacles to using vouchers in federally subsidized housing projects </narrative>
  <narrative>Requires GAO to conduct a study on what legislative, regulatory and administrative requirements of federal housing programs (HOME, LIHTC), or practices and policies of PHAs or owners present obstacles to the use of vouchers in federally assisted housing.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 18. Collection of data on tenants in projects receiving tax credits </narrative>
  <narrative>Requires state agencies administering Low-Income Housing Tax Credits to submit annual data to HUD on the characteristics of tenants in each Low-Income Housing Tax Credit project. Instructs state agencies, to the extent feasible, to collect data from owners through existing reporting processes and in a manner that minimizes burdens on property owners and directs HUD to establish standards and definitions for data collection, establish procedures to minimize duplicative reporting requirements for  properties assisted under multiple housing programs (in coordination with other federal agencies administering housing programs), provide states with technical assistance establishing data systems, and compile and make publicly available data submitted by states. Authorizes appropriations in Fiscal Years 2009 through 2013 to cover costs to HUD related to data collection.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 19. Agency authority for utility payments in certain circumstances </narrative>
  <narrative> In cases where an owner fails to make required utility payments, this section authorizes the PHA to use voucher subsidy payments normally due to the owner to pay for continued utility service. Requires a PHA to take reasonable steps to notify the owner before making direct utility payments instead of payments to the owner, except that no prior notification is required in cases where a utility cutoff rendering the unit uninhabitable has occurred or is threatened.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 20. Access to HUD programs for persons with limited English proficiency </narrative>
  <narrative> To facilitate compliance with the Executive Order requiring program access to people with Limited English Proficiency, this section directs HUD to convene a task force to identify vital documents that need to be translated to improve access to HUD services and make available translations within six months after documents are identified by the task force. Requires HUD to develop and carry out a plan to establish a housing information resource center to provide translations of written materials,  provide a toll-free 24 hour interpretation service, and conduct a study of best-practices.</narrative>
  <narrative> Authorizes appropriations to enable HUD to carry out the requirements of this section, and directs HUD to submit a report regarding its compliance within six months after enactment.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 21. Authorization of appropriations </narrative>
  <narrative> Authorizes appropriations for the amount necessary to provide incremental vouchers for 20,000 families in each year from fiscal year 2009 through 2013, and establishes preferences for receipt of such assistance to preserve affordable housing and for entities that provide voucher assistance on a regional basis.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 22. Effective date </narrative>
  <narrative> Provides that provisions of the bill take effect on January 1, 2009, except for Sections 3, 4, and 13 (relating to rents, income and asset limitations and fair market rents, which will take effect at the start of fiscal year 2010). Requires that PHAs and owners provide current tenants with notification of the major changes in the bill regarding rent policies and income and asset rules for continuing eligibility as soon as possible after enactment.</narrative>
