  <speaking speaker="400249" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during rollcall vote No. 1060 on <bill type="h" number="3688">H.R. 3688</bill>, I mistakenly voted my vote as a "yea" when I should have voted "nay." This was on the Peru Trade Agreement. I took the floor last night around 10 o'clock in the evening and spoke strongly against the bill, and then today I thought it was the rule and I voted for it.</paragraph>
