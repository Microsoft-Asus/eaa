    <paragraph>I do not have an opening statement. I indicate to the majority leader that we had a good discussion yesterday about the agenda ahead, not only for the balance of the week but upon our return, and look forward to having a very productive week, including the confirmation of some judges tomorrow or the next day.</paragraph>
