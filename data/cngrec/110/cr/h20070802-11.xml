    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise proudly this morning to tell this Nation and the children of the State of New Jersey that this House has heard their call for help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday's passage of <bill type="h" number="3162">H.R. 3162</bill>, the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act of 2007, was a significant achievement for the children of working Americans throughout this country. In New Jersey alone, this legislation will maintain coverage for over 120,000 children currently enrolled in New Jersey's FamilyCare program, while also helping the State provide care for the 136,000 children currently eligible for the program but not enrolled in it. The New Jersey FamilyCare program would also  be allowed to extend coverage to 126,000 young men and women who are aging out of the program but still need access to health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am especially glad that the CHAMP Act will also help 80,000 of the lowest income and most wonderful adults in my State keep their coverage through this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the SCHIP program that we passed yesterday has the potential to have a significant impact on improving children's health care across this Nation.</paragraph>
