  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this week I introduce the House companion to Senator Casey's Prepare All Kids Act of 2007. This bill is designed to help States expand their pre-K programs and child care services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As this chart shows, we get the biggest bang for our education dollars by investing in our children before they even go to school. Estimates show that the return on investing in early care in education is between 17 to 18 percent annually. If this were a stock, all of Wall Street would be buying it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation is very helpful to the children we represent in our States. For example, more than one-quarter of a million 4-year-olds in New York State would be eligible for the programs created in this bill, including 100,000 children who would qualify for free pre-K. The future prosperity of our Nation rests on setting our children on a path for success early in life.</paragraph>
