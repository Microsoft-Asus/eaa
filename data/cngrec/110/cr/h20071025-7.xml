    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the skill, the dedication and the sacrifice of our Nation's first responders. In particular, I would like to honor and thank all of the first responders who are on the front line perilously right now fighting the fires in Southern California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We rely on our first responders to help us survive the most difficult and the most challenging experiences that we face. I am proud that when we passed <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> this year, Congress took critical steps to provide Federal support for our Nation's first responders. These steps included increasing the amounts of funding available to States and localities for hazardous preparedness funding, what we are facing in California right now, and establishing a stand-alone communications interoperability grant  program so that our first responders could speak to each other as they were on the front line in these emergencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government must continue to provide States and localities with all the resources that they need to effectively respond to these emergencies. Please keep all of our first responders and the residents who have been affected by the Southern California fires in your thoughts and prayers.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
