  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, you know, one of the things that we heard about so often during the campaign last year was illegal immigration. And coming back to Congress, one of the things we are hearing about as we hold our town hall meetings is the impact of illegal immigrants having access to credit cards and to financial services in this country. Banking institutions, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury, and the IRS are allowing illegal immigrants the ability to sign up for credit cards,  mortgages, taxpayer identification numbers, and to transfer money back to their country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a problem, and there is a solution. <bill type="h" number="1314">H.R. 1314</bill> is a piece of legislation I have filed. It is bipartisan legislation with over 50 cosponsors. The Photo ID Security Act will close the loophole that illegal immigrants are using to obtain valid financial service information and access to these services. What it will do is change the identification that is required, requiring them to present a photo ID issued from their home country or the U.S. Everyone in the U.S. can legally obtain these documents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage all Members to cosponsor <bill type="h" number="1314">H.R. 1314</bill>.</paragraph>
