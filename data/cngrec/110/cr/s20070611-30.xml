    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to Robert B. Mehnert, who is retiring after 48 years of dedicated service to the Government and people of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Mehnert began his public service in 1958 with the U.S. Army, continuing in uniform until 1962. In 1963 he reentered Federal service, this time as a management intern with the then-Department of Health, Education and Welfare. He rose quickly through the ranks and, in 1971, Mr. Mehnert became Chief of the Office of Public Information at the National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health. Since 1998 he has directed the Office of Communications and Public Liaison at the library.  For more than a quarter century, Mr. Mehnert's keen editorial and literary talents have helped library's director, Donald A.B. Lindberg, M.D., and his predecessor, Martin M. Cummings, M.D., to communicate the most current and reliable medical and consumer health information to medical professionals, researchers, patients, families, and the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his tenure at the National Library of Medicine, Mr. Mehnert has been in the vanguard of a revolution in health information. The introduction of the Internet and the Web environment vastly increased the number and extent of NLM services and audiences. In 1997, after more than a century of serving the library and medical communities exclusively, the National Library of Medicine launched Medline freely on the Web and declared that it would seek to serve the general public as well. With Mr.  Mehnert's help, other NLM services for the consumer public quickly followed. In 1998, MedlinePlus.gov, a source of authoritative full-text health information written for the consumer was unveiled. In 2000, ClinicalTrials.gov--an NLM Web site that provides consumers with information on medical research studies that are recruiting patients--was launched. Other NLM consumer-oriented databases were introduced in the last decade as bandwidth and the power of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of Mr. Mehnert's most tangible legacies has been his recent service on the editorial team responsible for producing a new quarterly NIH magazine, NIHMedlinePlus, which is sent to doctors' offices nationwide for their patients to read. The production of this consumer-oriented magazine fulfills Congress's call to publicize the fruits of NIH-sponsored research to patients, their families, and the public at large.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Mehnert has been recognized by the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health for his exceptional leadership and achievements. Aside from numerous merit awards, his honors have also included being the recipient of both the NLM Director's Award and the NIH Director's Award on several occasions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As someone who has worked for many years to support medical research, I am especially grateful to people who have dedicated their lives to this crucial public health mission. Bob Mehnert has done that and is a great testament to what public service is all about. Bob and his wife, Helene, have three daughters, seven grandchildren,  and 1.5 great grandchildren--that is, one is on the way. I thank Bob for his distinguished career in service to the American  people, and I wish him many well-deserved years of happiness in retirement.</paragraph>
