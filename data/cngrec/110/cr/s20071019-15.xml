    <paragraph>Madam President, I had indicated earlier today that I was going to move to go to conference. The record should reflect that Speaker Pelosi and I have talked about this matter and we think it would be appropriate to go to conference. It is my understanding we are close to being able to do that. That would be good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a bill that needs to be done and can only be done if Democrats and Republicans agree. The majority of us in this body are Democrats, but it is a slim majority. So everything we do, I need to get 20 percent of the Republicans to move forward on legislation. Hopefully, we can do that and have a real good conference on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I indicated this morning, there are a number of issues that are important: A renewable portfolio; it is important we do something about CAFE; It is also important we do something about taxes so we can have the great entrepreneurs of America have the ability to invest in renewable energy. Right now the ability to do that is very limited because we have only given them a year, 2 sometimes with the tax credits, and they can't plan ahead for that. So those are the three things we need to work  on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is much more, but that gives us an idea of what we need to focus on, and it is not easy because the House did not have CAFE, we did not have the renewable portfolio. So it is going to take some mathematical moving around to get this done because we need to work it out, I would hope, so we can do CAFE in both bodies and renewables in both bodies. Anyway, we need to give this a valiant try, and that is what conferences are all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 340, <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, the House Energy bill; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of the Senate engrossed amendment to <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> be inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill be read a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees  and that the title amendment at the desk be agreed to.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam President, reserving the right to object, I had talked to the majority leader before he propounded the unanimous consent proposal. As we have discussed, we are trying to clear any objections on our side. Given the fact it is Friday and Members are traveling, we are having a few difficulties doing that. But it is my hope we can continue to work through it and resolve those so the unanimous consent request can proceed without any objection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this point, because of those challenges we have, while we are continuing to work in good faith to resolve them, I must respectfully object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard. The majority leader is recognized.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam President, we have had a good couple of months here in the Senate. We have accomplished a lot, working together. Hopefully, on this momentous piece of legislation, we can continue to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I indicated this morning, we had a number of conversations yesterday, Republican Senators that want to move this forward, and I think there is a real possibility we can get a conference and move forward on this and come up with legislation where this body agrees with the House as to how to proceed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand that is the case, and I understand why the junior Senator from Texas had to object. It is Friday afternoon. Hopefully, maybe next week, we can appoint conferees and move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
