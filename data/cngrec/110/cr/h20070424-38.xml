    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1676">H.R. 1676</bill>, the Native American Home Ownership Opportunity Act of 2007, reauthorizing the section 184 Indian Loan Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Frank and Subcommittee Chairwoman  Waters for their hard work in making this legislation a priority and recognizing the importance of the section 184 program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program offers home ownership, property rehabilitation, new construction and refinance opportunities for Native Americans. The primary purpose of the section 184 program is a 100 percent loan guarantee program for Native American families seeking home ownership who are members of participating tribes; 196 federally recognized tribes participate in this program, including 24 tribes from my home State of Oklahoma. Therefore, this program works by increasing home ownership in Indian country  and improving the quality of life in Indian communities. Without argument, this program increased Native American home ownership in Oklahoma and throughout Indian country across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 184 is administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Native American Programs, created in 1992 to address the lack of private mortgage capital in Indian country, and authorizing HUD to guarantee loans made by private lenders to Native Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The section 184 program guarantees single-family residential loans for Native American borrowers, and provides for a 100 percent guarantee of the outstanding principal and interest and payment of other necessary and allowable expenses. The flexible underwriting, low down payment, higher loan limits, loan guarantee fee, and absence of income limits make this the most affordable loan program available to tribal areas.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1676">H.R. 1676</bill>, the Native American Home Ownership Opportunity Act of 2007, introduced by Congressman Boren and Congressman Renzi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This important legislation authorizes section 184 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, which established a loan guarantee program for Native American families, Indian Housing Authorities and federally recognized Native American tribes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under current law this program is authorized through 2007. This bill will reauthorize the program through 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress established this program to provide access to private mortgage financing for Native American families, Indian Housing Authorities and federally recognized Native American tribes that could not otherwise acquire housing financing because of the unique legal status of Native American lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This loan guarantee under this program is used to construct, acquire, refinance or rehabilitate single-family housing located on trust land or land located in an Indian or an Alaska native area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 184 of the program guarantees single family, one- to four-family units, residential loans for homes located in these Indian and Alaska native areas where land may be tribal trust, allotted individual trust or fee simple. HUD offers 100 percent guarantee on the outstanding principal and interest and payment of necessary and allowable expenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The flexible underwriting, low down payment, higher loan limits, low guarantee fee and the absence of income limits make this the most affordable loan program available in tribal areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2007, about $6 million was appropriated for the loan guarantee program. Consequently, CBO has estimated that <bill type="h" number="1675">H.R. 1675</bill> will cost about $30 million over the 2008-2012 period if appropriators continue the funding at the level similar to previous years. Enacting this bill does not affect direct spending or revenues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this legislation was approved by the Committee on Financial Services by voice vote, and I urge the passage of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400441" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is my honor at this time to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Renzi), who is one of the authors of this legislation and someone who has worked tirelessly for Native American issues all across the country and particularly in his home State of Arizona.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400336" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Native American Home Ownership Opportunity Act of 2007 is an important piece of legislation that reauthorizes this vital section 184 Native American housing program which is operated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back in 2004, the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Housing, chaired by former Congressman Bob Ney, held the first congressional hearing on Native American housing in the history of the United States Congress on tribal lands in Tuba City, Arizona, out west on Navajo country. And many of the folks from both sides of the aisle got together and went out there and visited the Grand Canyon and got a chance to see the Navajo Nation, the pink stones and the sands, and they got to visit the country  and truly see the beauty and the conditions, but also the largest land mass of poverty in America, the size of West Virginia. And Bob Ney helped make that happen. And that hearing was important because it brought light to the challenges that face Native Americans when trying to achieve home ownership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Native Americans, as a group, have the single lowest home ownership rate in America, less than 25 percent. And the problem is especially acute on the Navajo Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this section 184 program provides 100 percent guarantees to the outstanding principal and interest for single-family residential homes. And to date, over 4,200 loans have been guaranteed by this program. Now everybody is out there talking about subprime lending and the default and the foreclosures. Only 30 loans in this Native American program have ever been defaulted on, less than 1 percent. This low rate greatly shows the efficiency of section 184, and the program has received the highest  rating of America's Office of Management and Budget, even though it doesn't need it. This year it is expected that the program will enable private lenders to finance about 1,600 new mortgages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to thank Congressman Boren of Oklahoma, Chairman Frank, who has been absolutely bipartisan and forward-thinking in pushing housing issues, particularly on Native American, Chairman Waters and the subcommittee, Chairman Biggert, and I want to thank Bob Ney for his advocacy for the poor around America and for Native American housing. If my colleagues don't think this is good, they don't know what is good.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank also my friends, Congressmen Neugebauer from Texas and Renzi from Arizona for their work on this legislation and for their bipartisan effort here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to HUD, 4,200 loans have been guaranteed since the inception of the program, totaling $517 million. As lenders have become more comfortable with making loans secured by land in Indian country, interest in this program has only increased. My home State of Oklahoma represents 34 percent of the total loans guaranteed through section 184, thereby increasing the number of my constituents who have access to home ownership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to thank Chairman Frank and Subcommittee Chairwoman Waters for recognizing the importance of the section 184 program in Indian country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for <bill type="h" number="1676">H.R. 1676</bill>, the Native American Homeownership Opportunity Act of 2007. This important legislation reauthorizes the Section 184 Indian Loan Program, which offers home ownership, property rehabilitation, new construction, and refinance opportunities for Native Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my friend, Mr. BOREN, for sponsoring this bill and championing this cause which is of great significance to so many Native families in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 184 advances the opportunity for Native Americans seeking homeownership and addresses the issue of lack of mortgage lending for homes in Indian Country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Section 184 program guarantees single-family residential loans for Native American borrowers, thereby increasing the homeownership for Native Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While many Native Americans struggle to own a home and provide for their families, <bill type="h" number="1676">H.R. 1676</bill> eases that burden. The program provides a 100 percent guarantee of the outstanding principal and interest and payment of other necessary and allowable expenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 184 allows for many Native Americans to become first-time homeowners. According to HUD, since the start of the program roughly 4,200 loans have been guaranteed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Almost 200 tribes participate in the Section 184 program nationwide, 31 of which are from my home State of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Inland Empire alone, the Saboba Band of Luiseno Indians, the Cabazon Band of Cahulla Mission Indians and the Morongo Band of Mission Indians have been able to provide homeownership for many families through this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1676">H.R. 1676</bill> will help close the homeownership gap and increase for Native Americans in my area and all across the country. Let's help all Americans achieve the dream of owning a home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400645" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Boren) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="1676">H.R. 1676</bill>.</chair>
