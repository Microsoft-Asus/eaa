    <paragraph>I am Ron Klein, and I represent Florida's 22nd Congressional District in south Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I am honoring the city of Dania Beach, a community in southeast Florida, for investing in a $1 million solar energy system to power the city's streetlights. Not only is this an innovative and environmentally sound decision made by the city of Dania Beach, but it is also a decision that will strengthen the safety of the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After Hurricane Wilma struck, Dania Beach could not restore its power and the pole damage quickly enough, leaving the city streets without lighting for a lengthy period of time. With the new solar panels, the streetlights will not be dependent on electricity, and the panels will be mounted to withstand even the most fierce hurricane winds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud this sort of ground-breaking, innovative way of thinking. Alternative energy sources are the way of the future. If more communities around the country would follow Dania Beach's lead, we would leave our environment in a much better condition for our children and our grandchildren.</paragraph>
