    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 46th anniversary of the United States Peace Corps. Saturday, September 22, marks the date on which Congress approved legislation formally authorizing the Peace Corps to promote world peace and friendship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since that time, more than 187,000 Peace Corps volunteers have been invited by 139 host countries to work on issues ranging from education to agricultural support and environmental preservation. Today's Peace Corps is more vital than ever, working and emerging in essential areas such as information technology and business development, and committing more than 1,000 new volunteers as part of the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that Minnesota's Second District is home to Carleton and St. Olaf Colleges. Both schools, located in Northfield, Minnesota have been recognized nationally for the large number of their graduates serving in the Peace Corps. These volunteers continue to help countless individuals who want to build a better life for themselves, their children, and their communities. It is an honor to stand before you to recognize the Corps and their volunteers.</paragraph>
