  <narrative>SCHEDULE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12208]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'd like to address the schedule for the rest of this week. Regular Members don't have a chance to talk. It's usually the majority leader and our chief deputy whip. But I did this a couple of weeks ago when we left at 5 o'clock. Today it's another 5 o'clock ending session.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have really three bills left to address this week, the Hard Rock Mining and Reclamation Act, which we could do tonight, Trade Globalization Assistance Act, which we could do tomorrow morning, and we could appoint our conferees tomorrow morning, mid-afternoon, which would allow many Members to be able to get home with their family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have an 8-year-old son. It might be nice to go trick-or-treating with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's no reason we have to be here for 2 days to conduct this type of work. I'm embarrassed for this House and the time spent here doing no work.</paragraph>
