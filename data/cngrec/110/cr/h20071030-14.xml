  <narrative>MAKE PERMANENT THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12158]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412213" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in my home State of Michigan, we have hit some hard times, and recently things have become worse as Michigan's Governor and tax-hiking State legislators inflicted a massive tax increase on the people of Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While in Congress, I am going to do all I can to aid Michigan's comeback, providing incentives for manufacturers and their employees to innovate, grow and expand. For example, American auto manufacturers spend $20 billion a year on research and development, and such investment and innovation among American automakers should be encouraged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One positive step Congress can immediately take to continue similar innovation is to make permanent the research and development tax credit. This legislation would keep high-tech, high-paying jobs in America by maintaining important incentives and enable American companies to grow, become more competitive globally, and ultimately result in additional high-paying American jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="2138">H.R. 2138</bill>, the research and development tax credit, and encourage further investment and growth in our great Nation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
