    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill>, the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act, the first reauthorization of national and community service laws and programs since 1993. I am pleased that today this House is taking up this important measure that will take volunteerism and service into the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was in March of 1961 that President John F. Kennedy first challenged a generations of Americans to ask "not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country." By establishing the Peace Corps and the Volunteers in Service to America programs, he inspired millions of Americans to make a difference here at home and around the globe. He created a powerful legacy of hope and service that connects us as Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Almost 50 years later, we should be very proud that volunteering in America is at a 30-year high. Through AmeriCorps and other service programs, new generations of Americans have become inspired to build stronger, more vibrant communities, help children succeed in schools, and rebuild cities in times of disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, in 2006, more than 61 million Americans gave back to their communities through service. That same year, volunteers in my home State of California contributed more than 858 million hours of service to our State economy, a value of more than $17 billion. In the 15 years since AmeriCorps was enacted into law, more than 500,000 Americans of all ages and backgrounds have participated in this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our current and future generations of volunteers deserve our renewed support for their programs, just as President Kennedy first provided decades ago. The GIVE Act, this legislation, recognizes this growing service movement that is taking place across the Nation. It builds upon the successful work being done in communities across by members of AmeriCorps, VISTA, Senior Corps and Learn and Serve America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AmeriCorps has become a successful model for public-private partnerships. Last year, the AmeriCorps program leveraged more than $200 million in matching funds, mobilized more than 1.4 million volunteers, and worked with 2,000 small and large faith-based and community-based organizations across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GIVE Act would strengthen the AmeriCorps service model by putting us on the path to increasing the number of AmeriCorps members from 75,000 to 100,000 by 2012 with a focus of engaging low-income, disadvantaged, and at-risk youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With soaring tuition prices making it more difficult for many students to get a college degree, the GIVE Act would help AmeriCorps members pay for college by increasing the scholarship that they earn in exchange for their service from $4,725 to $5,255 by 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would also introduce young people to community service by creating a new Summer of Service initiative that will offer middle school and high school students the opportunity to spend the summer working to improve their communities while earning a $500 education award that can be used for college or for college preparation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alumni of these programs remain valuable resources to our communities. More than 72 percent of AmeriCorps members continue to volunteer in their communities after their term of service ends. After Hurricane Katrina devastated gulf coast communities, AmeriCorps alumni played a key role in relief, recovery, and rebuilding efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To help tap into these resources in times of emergency, this bill would expand the number of volunteers ready to respond by creating an Alumni Reserve Corps of service alumni with previous experience serving during disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Volunteering also provides critical opportunities for older Americans to make a difference in their communities. Each year, nearly half a million older Americans participate in the Senior Corps programs, mentoring children of prisoners, providing independent living services to seniors, assisting victims of natural disasters, and mobilizing other volunteers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GIVE Act would expand the purpose of Senior Corps programs by adding an emphasis on recruiting retired STEM, health care, law enforcement and military professionals to help with education, after-school, public safety and technology needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, it would phase in the competition for the Retired and Senior Volunteer Programs, an important part of the Senior Corps by 2013, allowing new grantees and volunteers to join the service movement and encouraging innovation and evolution among high-performing programs. I also want to thank the RSVP program for working with us to ensure a responsible transition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Members on both sides of the aisle, in particular Representatives MCCARTHY, MCKEON and PLATTS, for their leadership, as well as the Service Caucus for their support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank our committee staff for their hard work on this bill, including Alex Ceja, Denise Forte, Stephanie Moore, Deborah Koolbeck with Mrs. McCarthy, Brad Thomas with Mr. McKeon, and Becky Wolfkiel with Mr. Platts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also thank Voices of Services and its member organizations, who were invaluable in helping us develop this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear that service has played an important role in this country's history and will continue to help us meet the challenges and needs of our communities. It is clear that the interest in volunteering reaches across all generations: our young people, retiring baby boomers, and older Americans. The GIVE Act reflects their commitment, and our commitment, to building a stronger country through service. I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort by supporting this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400267" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of the GIVE Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to begin by thanking Chairman Miller, as well as the Chair and the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mrs. McCarthy of New York and Mr. Platts from Pennsylvania, for their efforts to develop a solid, bipartisan bill that will strengthen our national service programs. I would also like to recognize Brad Thomas from my staff for his hard work on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many of my colleagues, particularly on this side of the aisle, I historically have had concerns about AmeriCorps and the other programs within the Corporation for National and Community Service. Particularly during the 1990s, Federal management of these programs was at best dismal.  For years, I joined many of my colleagues, led by Mr. Hoekstra, in seeking to establish performance measures to ensure that these national service programs are  in fact meeting their goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Bush administration, it has become clear that these programs are being held more accountable and they have become more efficient as a result. For example, the corporation received its seventh consecutive clean audit during the fiscal year 2006. Likewise, the corporation's leadership has instituted significant improvements in efficiency and quality, including streamlining the grants and application reporting processes, consolidating five field service centers into one, and automating  education award payments, time and attendance, and travel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, the recent management of this program has far surpassed its record of low accountability under the previous administration; and for that reason in particular, it deserves our continued support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, this program brings together our neighbors to serve one another and thus benefit our Nation. Although there are clear opportunities to strengthen and improve these programs, the simple fact is that the corporation plays a key and increasingly effective role in, as President Bush would say, "rallying the armies of compassion."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later today I plan to offer an amendment that will strengthen this already good bill. The purpose of my amendment is to acknowledge the patriotism, commitment, and sacrifice made by members of the military and their families. In return for their service to our Nation, I believe the least we can do is ensure our national service programs are able to benefit veterans and military families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this bill is based on sound principles for reform outlined by the administration and developed in conjunction with the corporation. It includes a long overdue emphasis on accountability with its inclusion of performance measures and increased competition. And on the whole, I find the bill to be a balanced one that is worthy of our support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this bill represents a bipartisan effort to come together on a program that is good for the citizens of this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, our Democrat colleagues have been unwilling to work in the same bipartisan fashion on our Nation's security interests. It has been 18 days since the Protect America Act expired, nearly 3 weeks that the majority has conspicuously refused to bring the bipartisan Senate Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act modernization bill to a vote. And yesterday we got a glimpse of the reason why. An anonymous Member argued that delaying action on this critical security measure made for good  politics. Madam Chairman, it is unfathomable that our Nation's security may be put at risk in the name of political gamesmanship. I strongly urge the majority to bring FISA modernization for a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Platts), and I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control that time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a great day for national service. It has been 15 years since we reauthorized our national service laws. As chairwoman of the Healthy Families and Communities Subcommittee, I am pleased to speak in support of <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill>, the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act, the GIVE Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased to say that the administration and the service community support the GIVE Act. I would like to thank Chairman Miller for his continued strong support and work on this reauthorization. I would also like to extend my thanks to the ranking member of our committee, Mr. McKeon, for his hard work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would like to thank my good friend and ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Platts, for his work on this reauthorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later I will speak on my manager's amendment, which is also a bipartisan effort. National service has a distinguished and strong history in our Nation. The benefits of service cannot be disputed. Evidence shows that service and volunteering lowers school dropout and crime rates, lowers costs associated with the aging population, and improves health among the elderly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Volunteering is a cost-effective way of working to solve the challenges facing our Nation today. That is why the passage of the GIVE Act is necessary. One of the most effective volunteer organizations in this Nation is AmeriCorps. AmeriCorps volunteers offer a range of services focused on low-income and disadvantaged communities. Our legislation recognizes their invaluable work and increases the number of participants to 100,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GIVE Act also encourages programs to recruit underrepresented populations to serve, including scientists and engineers, young people in our aging-out foster care, children at risk of delinquency, and other disadvantaged young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I truly believe that expanding national service, particularly to disadvantaged youth, is an effective way to combat things like youth gangs and violence, and the evidence bears it out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>If we are serious about reducing gang violence, we must take the first step and offer children an alternative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation creates a Summer of Service program which gives middle school and high school students an opportunity to become engaged in a positive way within their community. Through the Summer of Service program, our Nation's young people will have a chance to serve with others their own age while improving their community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Research shows that if students are engaged in service at an early age, they continue to serve throughout their life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are strengthening the mission of the first responder volunteer program, the National Civil Community Corps by requiring more intense disaster and emergency relief training during down periods in order to be better prepared in a time of crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are all aware of what our Nation faced in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and the NCCC was there to respond, and continues to recover today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GIVE Act will help our Nation become better prepared for future disasters by training and preparing more emergency volunteers. The GIVE Act creates in the corporation an office of outreach and recruitment. The new office will establish a reserve corps made up of those who have gone through the program and are alumni. The reserve corps alumni will be called on during emergencies, disasters, or other times of national need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've heard people asking over and over again during our hearings, why aren't we using former volunteers? The new outreach office will work to connect over 500,000 former volunteers who can be resources for recruitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GIVE Act lowers the age of participation in the National Senior Service to 55 years old. By lowering the age, we are encouraging retiring Americans to participate in national service and giving older Americans the opportunity to lead us into the future. Our Nation's retiring and retired adults are a rich resource that cannot be overlooked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every American, old and young, has skills that improve the day-to-day functions of our society. The GIVE Act encourages individuals to get involved, creates a deeper commitment to service, and makes our Nation more like what it should be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to again thank Chairman Miller for his deep commitment to national service, Ranking Member McKeon and Congressman Platts for their work with us on this bipartisan activity. And I urge my colleagues to support this much needed legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400321" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to speak today, and I certainly rise also in support of <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill>, the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act. This program will certainly strengthen and finally reauthorize the Nation's national and community service programs. And after 15 years, this reauthorization is certainly long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to add my words of praise and thanks to my Chair, Chairwoman  McCarthy, as well as to the full committee Chair, Chairman Miller, and the ranking member, BUCK MCKEON, for their important leadership in moving this reauthorization forward of this very important program that promotes active involvement of citizens of all ages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1973, Congress passed the Domestic Volunteer Service Act, DVSA, to foster and expand volunteer service in communities while helping vulnerable and disadvantaged populations such as the elderly and the poor. DVSA authorized the National Senior Volunteer Corps, made up of the Foster Grandparents Program, the Senior Companion Program, and the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seventeen years later, Congress passed the National and Community Service Act, NCSA, of 1990. NCSA aims to address unmet human, educational, environmental, and public safety needs, as well as to renew a sense of civic responsibility by encouraging citizens to participate in national service programs. Authorized under NCSA are Learn and Serve America, AmeriCorps State and national grants, and the National Civilian Community Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both DVSA and NCSA are administered by the Corporation for National Community Service, and both laws were most recently amended in 1993 by the National and Community Service Act. While authorization of appropriations for both laws expired at the end of fiscal year 2006, these programs have remained funded through annual appropriations measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm pleased to be a cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill>, the GIVE Act, and believe that this bill makes commonsense improvements to our Nation's national service programs. Not only does it provide increased flexibility for States, but importantly, and as referenced by Ranking Member McKeon, it also increases accountability and efficiency within the administration of these programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill> strengthens existing community and national service programs by providing year-round service opportunities for students and elderly alike, and further encourages involvement of disadvantaged youth. This legislation also expands eligibility requirements for senior serving programs like Foster Grandparents and the Senior Companion Program, ensuring that individuals with an interest in serving have options available to them. Finally, the GIVE Act reauthorizes DVSA and NCSA through fiscal  year 2013.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recent natural disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, as well as the wild fires in California, have showcased the important efforts of AmeriCorps and NCCC volunteers. I am proud to be part of this effort to strengthen national service programs and ensure that participants can continue to aid disadvantaged and needy populations. And I have seen firsthand in my district the great work of senior citizens in the Senior Companion Program and young citizens in AmeriCorps partnering with Habitat  for Humanity to truly make a difference in Central Pennsylvania. And we know that these efforts are being replicated across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam Chairman, I hope that all will join in supporting the GIVE Act and vote in favor of this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill>, the GIVE Act, reauthorizes our national service programs for the first time in 15 years. This legislation strengthens programs like AmeriCorps, Vista, Senior Corps and Learn and Serve America so they can continue their invaluable services and expand into underserved communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of my congressional district are no strangers to community service. We have four effective Retired Senior Volunteer Programs, known as RSVPs, located in my district: West Central Illinois RSVP, Adams County RSVP, RSVP of the Quad Cities, and RSVP of Springfield, Illinois. Together, these programs engage 3,464 volunteers in 577,226 hours of services in 13 counties. I had the opportunity to visit several of these last October and was impressed by their organization, their large number  of volunteers, and the variety of services that they offer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Illinois RSVP volunteers serve the young and old, the healthy and the infirm. They work in hospitals, nursing homes, libraries, with the Red Cross, police department, and assist with home delivery meal programs. These dedicated volunteers touch the lives of hundreds of people and have a profound impact on the communities in which they serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Miller, Ranking Member McKeon, and their staffs for their work on this legislation and their efforts to address these concerns.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield as much time as he consumes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Hoekstra).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400182" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, you know it's a good day today where we have the opportunity to go back and reauthorize the Corporation for National and Community Service. This is a program that 15 years ago is a program that I supported, and I'm glad that this Congress is going to take the steps to move this program forward and continue the efforts in this area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, if we're really going to protect the Corporation for National and Community Service, if we are really going to protect the individuals that are working in these types of programs, what we should have been doing today and what we should do is we should extend the terrorist surveillance program. We should pass FISA modernization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, 3 weeks ago the majority said that this bill would come to the floor. They needed a 3-week extension to get the bill done. That expires this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're going to have a long day today. We'll be here till 2 or 3 o'clock, which I think will be the third week in a row where we will go home early and we will not take care of this vital national security issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've had a 6-month extension, we had a 2-week extension. The program now has lapsed for 3 weeks. Each and every day our capabilities erode just a little bit more. And each and every day we remove these capabilities to track foreign terrorists by our Intelligence Community, each and every day America becomes a little bit more vulnerable. Americans living at home, people in this program, our men and women in uniform in Afghanistan and in Iraq, they're a little bit more vulnerable. Our embassy  personnel around the world are a little bit more vulnerable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this week the statement was made, well, you know, we'd maybe like to do FISA this week but the schedule is just too full. We're not going to have the opportunity to get to it. We're not going to have the opportunity to get to it. We're going to be done working some time in the middle of the afternoon and we're going to leave a national security issue laying on the table for the third week in a row?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Will the majority deal with this issue next week? Will they deal with it before we go on recess? Or will they allow it to lapse for 6 weeks? How vulnerable does America need to become before the majority decides to act on FISA?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just wonder if the majority's even looking at what's going on around the world, taking a look at the attacks that are taking place in Pakistan, taking a look at the attacks that are happening in Afghanistan, listening to the rhetoric that's coming out of Iran, listening to the rhetoric that's coming out from al Qaeda in Iraq, listening to the rhetoric that's coming out of Hezbollah in Syria and in Lebanon. There are threats against our allies. There are threats against Western Europe. There  are threats against our friends in Northern Africa. There are threats against Western Europe, and yes, there are threats against the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They're not listening to what al Qaeda and radical jihadists and other terrorists are saying. They're not reading what these individuals are saying, because if you were listening to what they were saying, if you were reading what they were writing, and if you were watching what they were doing, you would understand that the threat is real and that it is a grave mistake to  allow this intelligence tool and to allow other intelligence tools to erode continually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, America's more vulnerable today than it was 3 weeks ago. America is more vulnerable today than it was 14 months ago because, on national security issue after national security issue, the other side refuses to give our intelligence community the tools that they need to keep America safe. These tools have developed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They've evolved. They've been working very, very well in protecting America. But for the last 14 months, the majority has not only let these tools evolve and deteriorate, in many cases they've been under direct attack from the majority. Today our intelligence community is paying a price because they do not have the tools necessary to keep America safe. Hopefully, America will not pay a price because the intelligence community hasn't been given the tools by the majority to keep America safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time to bring the Senate bill to the floor. This is a bill that has widespread support, passed by 68 votes in the Senate, supported by a majority of the Republicans and the Democrats in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bring that bill to the House. Bring it up right after the GIVE Act. Make sure that we've got the tools in place to keep America safe and to keep the people working in this program and other programs safe.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to my colleague on the Healthy Families and Communities Subcommittee, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412212" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today to commend Chairman Miller, Chairwoman McCarthy, Ranking Member McKeon, and others for putting together a very strong reauthorization of the National and Community Service Act of 1990 and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>It supports the Nation's priorities in a number of important areas. In particular, I'd like to thank the committee's leadership for recognizing the critical role that veterans and older Americans can play in solving problems and strengthening communities, by recommending several new provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our veterans are simply the best of what this country has to offer, both with respect to their exemplary character and the technical, professional, and administrative expertise which they acquire during their years of service. They are an invaluable and untapped resource to underserved communities. America should embrace the opportunity to establish a well-defined veterans-centered and -integrated community support system based on national and community service. The GIVE Act begins a national  conversation on how to make this happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every day nearly 8,000 of the Nation's 78 million baby boomers turn 60. We know from research that the vast majority plan to work or stay engaged in their community well past traditional retirement age. This is a wonderful opportunity, given their stated interest in helping others and the ever-worsening labor shortage in education, health care, government, and nonprofit work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm a strong supporter of the idea that those who have finished their mid-life careers can be a force for social good in the 21st century. By turning the aging of America into a positive story, we can tap into this energy. It is going to take creativity, experimentation, bold action, and looking to the future more than the past. Congress has a critical responsibility, along with the States and the private sector, to ensure baby boomers will have the opportunity to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We talk about this wave of returning veterans, and we talk about the demographic wave of aging Americans. How you respond to a wave depends on how you position yourself. That wave can either come crashing down on us, or it can be a wave that lifts us up and moves us forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to continuing to work with the committee and this Congress to explore additional proposals to capture the energy, idealism, and talent of our veterans and millions of older Americans who want to make a major contribution to the public good.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400321" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I certainly am pleased to be part of moving this legislation, the GIVE Act; but I do want to associate myself with the gentleman from Michigan, the ranking member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, on the importance of us moving the reauthorization of FISA; and, hopefully, we will get to that as quickly as possible and restore the tools to our intelligence community they need to protect our Nation and our citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I'd like to yield as much time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, I don't think there is a more important bill than this; and yet to hear some of the critics, it's like we're just paying people to be volunteers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The thing I love about Ronald Reagan was Ronald Reagan believed in the future of America, the youth of America, and that the best was yet to come. And he gave us a sense of hope, as did President Kennedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When President Kennedy talked about the Peace Corps, I was in eighth grade. My parents bought a TV set to listen to the debate between Nixon and President Kennedy, and I was just enthralled by a President who asked me, a young person, to do something for the world, and that was to become a Peace Corps volunteer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And from that point on, that was one of my dreams. It was something I wanted to do ..... become a Peace Corps Volunteer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Guess what? Peace Corps volunteers are paid. We earn a salary and are given a stipend because we have to eat. We are given a certain sum of money at the end, not for education, but to frankly be able to come back and just buy some clothes. When you clean your underwear on rocks for 2 years, you don't want to continue to wear them when you get home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what did President Clinton want to do? He said we have the Peace Corps for those who volunteer overseas. And we have Vista for those who want to be of service in these United States. But we can make Vista better. We're going to have expanded national service here at home, and by the way, while this was happening we in Congress were getting rid of summer jobs for kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President said and I want this expanded national service program to be a bipartisan proposal. I want to work with Republicans. Let's make this something all of us can get behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I got excited with his call to us. Let's work together, and we did. Because instead of a national program where one-size-fits-all, he said it's going to be a competitive process, something Republican should like.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And by the way, I'll just say parenthetically, Ms. Matsui has an amendment that I am a chief cosponsor of that says let's have more of the dollars be competed for by State and local communities. It's an amendment that should pass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we did is have a national program called AmeriCorps, but we had two-thirds of it going to the States. Now, the problem with that is you're going to have some bad programs that might get funded. The good thing about it is you're going to have some great programs that are going to be funded. And so former President Clinton took a risk. He said instead of having a one-size-fits-all, which would mean we'll have vanilla, and, no one can criticize it, we had some great programs and some bad  programs. So the critics of AmeriCorps then took the bad programs and started to criticize as if this was all of AmeriCorps, as if this was the President's national service bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the bottom line is we have some great programs. Thank God we had these programs for people impacted by Katrina and other natural disasters. In my part of the country, we have young people who are giving to their neighbors, and if you think they're paid, they're paid a minimum wage and they have a stipend they can use towards their education. It gets them to think about their future and get an education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we have people here who will say, well, let's give out Pell Grants, we're going to give out Pell Grants for nothing; and yet we have an opportunity to give out grants that someone actually earned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can't speak more strongly for this legislation. I congratulate President  Clinton for bringing it forward, for working with Republicans, at least those who were willing to work with him, and for having a program that has energized young people to be of service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are six former Peace Corps volunteers in this House, three Republicans, three Democrats. If you asked any one of us what was the most significant time in our lives, it was serving in the Peace Corps. It was helping others. But we came back more enriched than probably we gave. And I'm absolutely certain of this, the folks that are doing national service, they don't get much monetarily, but they give a lot; and in return they get a lot in terms of their personal development. They grow as  individuals. They have more confidence in themselves. I think they're better Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope whoever's the next President, and we have three good candidates to choose from, I have a preference obviously, but I think that they are going to inspire Americans to be of greater service, and they could use this legislation to help them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we pass it, and I thank our sponsors for bringing this bill out. I particularly want to thank our colleagues from New York and from Pennsylvania for their effort here today. God bless this country and God bless this program.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, as a former social worker and administrator and a cosponsor of the GIVE Act, I rise today to express my strong support for <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was able to see firsthand the hard work and self-sacrifice and dedication of our AmeriCorps volunteers during the Katrina recovery effort. As a relief volunteer myself, I worked side by side with the AmeriCorps volunteers. You can't say enough about these young people who gave of themselves and worked tirelessly for many, many hours to give comfort to their fellow Americans. This convinced me how essential AmeriCorps and other national service programs really are to this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My experiences as a social worker and as an administrator and relief volunteer have made the reauthorization of this program a high priority for me, and I'm proud that it's a high priority for this Congress as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm also grateful that the committee passed my amendment to increase the minimum amount of the State formula grants. This increase acknowledges that these volunteer programs are equally important in smaller States such as New Hampshire. These programs and the participants who are in them work miracles for very low money, and we need to thank them.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400218" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I want to thank and commend my good friend Mrs. McCarthy from New York for the wonderful leadership that she has shown in the reauthorization of this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with my good friend and colleague from Connecticut that this is one of the more important pieces of legislation that we will be dealing with in this session of Congress, and I commend the efforts of everyone on the committee for the bipartisan support that's been shown on behalf of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this legislation will provide a vital increase in funding for a variety of domestic volunteer service programs, including AmeriCorps, Volunteers in Service to America, and Learn and Serve America. Expanding these important community-based programs is essential so that residents in the neediest places receive the assistance that they need and deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm very proud that my home State of Wisconsin has more than 35 AmeriCorps programs. Jump Start for Young Children is just one of several programs that help prepare young children from low-income families to succeed and go on in school. Just this past year, this program benefited from the service of 3,500 corps members and volunteers from over 70 colleges. Together, these individuals were able to assist more than 13,000 preschoolers in over 20 of our States in this country. I'd like to applaud  the hard work and selfless efforts of these individuals who have not only rebuilt houses in communities but also lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm especially proud that three of my congressional staff members are former AmeriCorps volunteers: Karrie Jackelen, Brad Smith, and David De Gennaro. The contributions of these participants is truly admirable given the enormous difference they've made in so many lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, there is a yearning for community involvement and community service across this country, and it's especially acute with the youth, the children of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was unfortunate that the current President sent this Nation to war without asking for any type of contribution or significant sacrifice from the average American. Except for our troops and their families who have borne the brunt of this sacrifice and burden, there's very little asked of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation, which was the vision of President Clinton and his administration, tries to correct that deficiency. It's a good, bipartisan bill. I encourage my colleagues to pass the GIVE Act today.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412198" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act, otherwise known as the GIVE Act. This legislation speaks to what makes our country great, Americans volunteering to give back to their communities. Volunteerism is so important to helping the less fortunate, working to better one's community, and instilling a sense of patriotism and love for one's country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Volunteers are critical to pulling our country through hard times. Following the hurricanes that plagued my home State of Florida, I witnessed firsthand the overwhelming response from volunteers who came out to respond to the needs of hurricane victims. Volunteers came together to provide these victims with clothing, food, shelter, and other items that displaced residents and families needed to get their lives back on track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GIVE Act will continue this strong tradition of volunteerism in America by increasing community service opportunities and providing new incentives for volunteering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, I am proud to support legislation that puts a premium on disaster preparedness and emergency response.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to commend Representative McCarthy for her work on this bill and urge my colleagues to support this bill for the betterment of all our communities and our country as a whole.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Each side has 11 minutes remaining.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400257" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as we have been working through this bill, through our hearings and everything else, and listening to the volunteers that work in AmeriCorps and other aspects of volunteering, and also listening to our young people from communities that are underserved on how they want to serve and be part of it, before my colleague from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) talked about how we've done away with summer jobs. We see in our communities today more and more of our young people joining gangs  and getting into trouble. We see that our juvenile justice system and our prisons are being overflowed, unfortunately, with young people. This is a program that can help them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, I look at our country and I marvel at how people volunteer and give their time to help other people that are in need. With the programs that we're putting forth and through the work of the subcommittee and  through the work of my colleague Mr. Platts from Pennsylvania, we have put together a great bill. This is a bill that can help people to the future. This is a bill that incorporates our elderly and our young. So, it's something that  I think we should all be proud of. And certainly I'm hoping that we're not going to have any controversies further down the line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And may I just say one thing: A number of speakers have gotten up and talked about the FISA bill. Let me say this to the American people: With the continuation that we have, this country is being protected. And we are trying to work it out with our colleagues from the other side and the administration. But let me make one thing very clear, the country is being protected. The intelligence committees can do what they need to do, and our intelligence community is getting information at that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400321" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to again just thank my subcommittee chairman, Chairwoman McCarthy, for her leadership on this important legislation, as well as the full committee Chair, Mr. Miller, and the ranking member, Mr. McKeon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a number of speakers have talked about their own experience and the gentleman from Connecticut, through his work in the Peace Corps, these opportunities to participate in the programs that are funded and authorized under the National Community and Service Act impact not just those who receive the benefit of the work done, but those who actually participate. And with a family member who has participated in AmeriCorps, I have seen that impact on that individual and how they were a stronger person  and better prepared for the rest of their adult years because of having been part of AmeriCorps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, again, I urge a "yes" vote for this legislation and look forward to it moving forward through the House and working with the Senate to get it to the President's desk.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill>, the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education or "GIVE" Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation reauthorizes and strengthens our national service programs. I would like to thank my good friend CAROLYN MCCARTHY, chairwoman of the Healthy Families and Communities Subcommittee and Congressman TODD PLATTS, the ranking member, for their excellent, bipartisan work on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The spirit of service runs strong in America. Many Americans--young and old, rich and poor--look for ways to give back to their communities and the Nation. Our national service programs nurture this spirit and ensure that all American have opportunities to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GIVE Act will increase the number of Americorps volunteers to 100,000. In my congressional district Americorps volunteers are promoting community development, improving education, and enhancing the quality of life for many of our residents. They bring a great deal of energy and contribute to a strong sense of community in our area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GIVE Act fosters an ethic of civic engagement in young people through a summer of service program that will enable students in middle and high school to volunteer and earn an education award for college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GIVE Act promotes service in areas of national need for global competitiveness, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GIVE Act will ensure that we can effectively and efficiently mobilize volunteers in times of national disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GIVE Act strengthens opportunities for our seniors by providing flexibility to the senior corps programs. In my congressional district, we have very strong programs that engage our seniors in service and provide them companionship and support. Our seniors continue to make tremendous contributions to our communities. We cannot afford to let their talent or energy go to waste.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home State of Texas is a big believer in national service. We have 48,000 senior corps members. Since 1994, 24,000 Texans have earned education awards by serving as Americorps volunteers; 48,000 students have participated in Learn and Serve America, linking service with academic achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GIVE act will make this great tradition of service even stronger. I urge all of my colleagues to vote "yes."</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400240" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the GIVE Act and I thank my colleague Mrs. MALONEY for her leadership on this issue. Volunteers in our National Service Corps are doing the hard work of building what I like to call the Beloved Community--a community at peace with itself based on justice and human dignity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all live in one house, the American house, and people are suffering. We need so many more Americans to volunteer, to share their talents, their time and their love. That is how we form the Beloved Community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So many Americans are giving of themselves through Americorps/VISTA, Summer of Service, and our Senior Volunteer Corps. Many more want to give and volunteer, but they can't find the time. They are stuck at work trying to make ends meet. They sit in traffic. They are helping their kids with homework. Businesses and governments need to encourage and allow people to volunteer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Young people have been behind all of the great social movements in this Nation. We must tap into the idealism and the talents of our young people, and the young at heart, who can build bridges and ease suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Something is happening in America. In Atlanta, we are embracing the merger between the Points of Light Foundation and the "Hands On" Network. I want to mention their good work and their leadership in recruiting and training volunteers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleagues to find more ways, like competitive grants for nonprofits, to expand our volunteer infrastructure, to push our national service agenda forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GIVE Act is a good bill. It has my support. I thank my colleagues.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400415" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, throughout our history, American citizens have never hesitated to heed the call to service. They have answered in times of peace and prosperity, in times of war and recession. They have donated time and money and sweat--as much as they could, whenever it was needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When our Nation faced the Great Depression, President Roosevelt formed the Civilian Conservation Corps and put citizens to work for the national interest. When we faced political uncertainty in the world, President Kennedy challenged our young people to serve and dispatched the Peace Corps on missions of international aid and public diplomacy. And when neighbors have challenges, when communities struggle, or when the Nation sees tragedy, our citizens rally and lend a hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, we have seen some of the largest increases in volunteerism in history. This new trend is led by our young people, who are serving in record numbers. The number of college students who volunteer increased by 20 percent between 2002 and 2005. And the programs we consider today are a key part of that service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's legislation will increase enrollment in AmeriCorps and establish ways to deploy AmeriCorps alumni in times of national need. It will establish an Office of Outreach and Recruitment to match new volunteers with service opportunities. It will create a new program, a Summer of Service, to encourage more young people to help their communities. It will strengthen our emergency preparedness and disaster response with improvements to the National Civilian Community Corps. And it will challenge  our scientists, mathematicians, and engineers to meet our Nation's technical needs with creativity and innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, Americans have made tremendous investments through national service. Let us, in turn, pass this legislation today to assist their efforts and continue their commitment to our Nation's future.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act. The GIVE Act will expand the Corporation for National and Community Service which has been instrumental in helping connect Americans to high quality, meaningful service and service-learning opportunities. The GIVE Act will increase the benefits of service available to more participants and more communities, improve program quality, ensure participant  diversity, increase the value of the AmeriCorps education award, and reduce the age eligibility for Senior Corps to 55.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last 14 years more than 500,000 individuals have served through AmeriCorps and have earned education awards worth more than $1.5 billion. Senior Corps members have generated more than 1 billion volunteer service hours, and more than 15 million young people have participated in service-learning initiatives funded by Learn and Serve America. In addition, the national service programs have provided opportunities for growing numbers of Americans to serve our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since AmeriCorps was created in 1994, Texas has benefited from over 22,000 young people serving for at least 1 year in our communities. Through programs such as the "National Civilian Community Corps" and "City Year," AmeriCorps volunteers address critical Texas needs in the areas of education, public safety, disaster response and recovery, and environment preservation. These programs serve the important role of providing an outlet for service to the country in a manner previously not afforded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the AmeriCorps program has done great things for Texas and this Nation as a whole, as is reflected in the AmeriCorps members pledge to "get things done." I am indeed honored to support this wonderful program which represents the very best of the United States of America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the Committee on Education and Labor for all of their work in bringing this bill to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National service is one of the most productive, cost efficient investments the Federal Government can make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife Betsi and I were Peace Corps volunteers and we call ourselves volunteers because we gave 2 years of our lives in service to others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americorps is a similar program to Peace Corps. It takes 18, 19, 20-year-old kids and gives them an opportunity to work in a program mentored by various nonprofit organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The passion of participants in Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, and other national service programs is undeniable. As they give back to their country they also learn something about themselves, each other, and the world around them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill> expands the AmeriCorps program and increases the education award, which participants in the program receive upon completion of service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the cost of a college education increases, students often have to choose between public service careers and other jobs to pay back student loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased we are making amendments in order under this rule because I believe they will strengthen this underlying reauthorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Matsui and I have offered an amendment to streamline funding for State and national AmeriCorps programs, which will encourage coordination, efficiency, and high quality programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, this amendment will improve the collaboration between State and national entities to better serve local needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman McDermott, Congressman Farr and I have offered an amendment to establish a Congressional Commission on Civic service that will investigate ways to increase and encourage service opportunities throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Commission will consider and promote ideas to inspire community service initiatives around the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no substitute for the passion of our Nation's volunteers, who can be found mentoring students, building houses, assisting senior citizens or beautifying our national parks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a co-sponsor of this legislation, I am proud to support national service initiatives and encourage my colleagues to support this important reauthorization today.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400283" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to take a minute to recognize an enduring legacy of John F. Kennedy--the Peace Corps--in recognition of its 47th anniversary this year. It is an honor to serve with the likes of my colleague and friend Chris Shays and others in this body and the others who serves our country in the enhancement of citizen diplomacy. I hope all Americans will join us in supporting and expanding this enduring commitment to convey our values as a Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Fareed Zakaria wrote: "We must begin to think about life after Bush--a cheering prospect for his foes, a dismaying one for his fans (however few there may be at the moment). In 11 months he will be a private citizen, giving speeches to insurance executives. America, however, will have to move on and restore its place in the world. To do this we must first tackle the consequences of our foreign policy of fear. Having spooked ourselves into believing that we have no option but to act fast,  alone, unilaterally and pre-emptively, we have managed in six years to destroy decades of international good will, alienate allies, embolden enemies and yet solve few of the major international problems we face."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The London Financial Times last December reported that the U.S. has suffered a significant loss of power and prestige around the world in the years since the beginning of this century, limiting our ability to influence international crises, according to an annual survey from a well regarded British security think-tank. The 2007 Strategic Survey of the non-partisan International Institute for Strategic Studies' picked the decline of U.S. authority as one of the most important security developments  of the past year--but suggested the fading of American prestige began earlier, largely due to its failings in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of our most special and effective citizen agencies of public diplomacy is the Peace Corps. Think of this--more than 187,000 volunteers have served this venerable legacy of former President Kennedy, serving in 139 countries--where they bring our values to other peoples, and bring understanding and appreciation of other cultures back home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The greatest gift of the Peace Corps and other civilian programs is not just that ordinary Americans share their values and our culture with other peoples, but also that when volunteers return, they bring greater understanding and appreciation of other cultures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Foreign policy is not just what we do, but also who we are. America as a place has often been the great antidote to U.S. foreign policy--and it should be again. Mr. Zakaria writes that "When American actions across the world have seemed harsh, misguided or unfair, America itself has always been open, welcoming and tolerant....."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of the day, our openness is our greatest foreign policy. We have succeeded not because of the ingenuity of our government, but rather because of efforts like this unique program to keep ourselves open to the world--to  sending our people out across the countries of the world to share our unique culture, our goods and services, our ideas and inventions, our people and cultures. This openness, this civilian diplomacy, has allowed us to make friends across boundaries. It will be central to our place as a nation in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, as we celebrate National Peace Corps Week, we honor the more than 190,000 volunteers who have served in 139 developing countries since President Kennedy's call to service in 1961--and I honor 44 of my constituents currently serving our country in places as diverse as China, Mali, Azerbaijan, Macedonia, El Salvador, and Namibia. This can be lonely and demanding service, but service that can create enduring friendships and values that transcend boundaries and cultures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, more than 8,000 Peace Corps volunteers around the world are currently providing training and education in 74 countries. These volunteers each donate their time and skills for over 2 years, in order to make a difference in the world and to promote understanding between cultures. By offering their valuable skills and showing a passion for helping others, they show the world that Americans value learning and cross-cultural exchange.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Volunteers work in areas of education, health and HIV/AIDS, business development, environment, agriculture and youth, and must often be creative and flexible when living and working in new cultures and learning new languages. The resulting experience is rewarding for all involved, and it highlights the importance of cooperation and involvement between cultures around the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When volunteers return home and share their overseas experiences with their communities, the Peace Corps helps Americans as much as the people in developing countries. From recent college graduates to doctors with decades of experience, volunteers choose to use their valuable skills and education to help people all over the world, but their work affects their lives long after returning home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week we remember the dedication and passion of Peace Corps volunteers, young and old, current and returned. We thank them for their service, and encourage more Americans to volunteer with the Peace Corps.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act, the GIVE Act, <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill>. I congratulate Chairman MILLER and Chairwoman MCCARTHY and Ranking Members MCKEON and PLATTS on their work toward this day and moving us closer to finally reauthorizing the Corportation for National and Community Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many noteworthy programs in the GIVE Act, including Senior Corps and AmeriCorps, which give countless Americans the opportunity to volunteer. Today, I would like to bring attention to a new and very promising program that I have worked to include in the GIVE Act. This new part of the law will provide grants to non-profit organizations to encourage increased volunteer, community, workforce, and educational participation in older adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recent research shows that Americans in the second half of life--regardless of income, educational level, or race--want to explore options for the next stage of life, including service opportunities, obtaining new training, retooling existing skills, pursuing educational interests, and exploring flexible work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This initiative is a timely and necessary way to help the large U.S. `boomer' generation make the transition to a new productive life phase by providing support and community connections for ongoing learning, development, and contribution to society. Similar programs currently function as an initiative of Civic Ventures and are a proven success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am hopeful that we will be able to bring a program to my district to assist those that are in a transition period, whether they have lost a job, are looking for a career change, or would like to move into a volunteer role in the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, again I thank the leadership of the Education and Labor Committee and its excellent staff for assisting in securing this program authorization and in moving the GIVE Act forward.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill>, the "Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act" or the "GIVE Act." I would like to thank my colleague Congresswoman MCCARTHY for introducing this important legislation, as well as the Chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor, Congressman GEORGE MILLER, for his leadership in bringing the bill to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this legislation will make vital strides toward expanding and improving key community service programs, including AmeriCorps, VISTA, Senior Corps, and Learn and Serve America. The GIVE Act works to ensure that volunteers, and the organizations that support them, will receive the resources that they need to continue their vital work in our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's legislation embodies the altruistic spirit that has made our Nation great. Great numbers of Americans donate their time and their unique skills and gifts to our cities and communities, without any expectation of compensation or material reward. According to a 2005 study, 29 percent of the American public, or about 65.4 million people, had volunteered in the past year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation engages our youth and fosters a sense of civic duty. At many of our Historically Black Colleges and Universities the idea of continual service to community is embedded into the very walls of the institution. Right in this city, Howard University has symbolically and yet openly stated its belief in service. Veritas and Utilitas, Truth and Service is on the very seal of the University. Institutions such as Texas Southern University and Texas A&amp;M University continue to provide our  young people with leadership skills that are grounded in service and compassion for their fellow man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I was so pleased to see Section 1202 of this legislation, giving special consideration to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and Tribal Colleges and Universities. I want to thank Chairman MILLER for allowing me to add to this great bill. By adding predominately minority community colleges to the list of those to receive special consideration, we help so many more students who have a commitment to service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our community colleges are growing as many of our returning veterans, single parents, and seniors desire to make a change in their life circumstances and simply cannot afford traditional higher education. A sense of civic engagement is not fostered only among students at Harvard and Berkeley; it is also found among students at community colleges like Houston Community College and North Harris College. I thank the Chairman for recognizing this needed addition and incorporating it into the Manager's Amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GIVE Act would: (1) increase the number of AmeriCorps volunteers from 75,000 to 100,000 by 2012; (2) increase stipends for AmeriCorps volunteers from $4,725 to $5,225 by 2012; (3) initiate a "Summer of Service" program for young people from middle school through high school to give them the opportunity to spend a summer in service to their community, for which they would receive a $500 stipend for college or for college preparation; and (4) create an AmeriCorps Alumni Reserves Network aimed  at tapping into the skills and experience of alumni volunteers, with a particular focus on assisting during emergencies or natural disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to cosponsor legislation that will add service before self to our leaders of tomorrow. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act. I would like to thank Chairman GEORGE MILLER, Ranking Member MCKEON, Chairwoman MCCARTHY, and Ranking Member PLATTS for their work on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill> reauthorizes the national service programs for the first time in over 10 years and contains many positive changes and updates for these programs. During committee consideration of the bill, I added language to make many of these programs more accessible for court-involved youth and adults, including individuals who have previously been incarcerated. I believe that getting these individuals involved in service could be a positive first step to reintegrating these individuals into their  communities and giving them an avenue to begin positively participating in society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I support this bill, I remained concerned about one provision, which requires the recompetition of grants under the Retired Senior Volunteer Program, RSVP. During committee consideration of this bill, Congressman HARE and I submitted an amendment that would have given existing RSVP grantees in good standing priority consideration for future grants. Since that time, we have worked with the committee to improve the provision that is in the bill, including giving existing programs  technical assistance and additional time to prepare for recompetition. I appreciate this work towards a more fair system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I believe that existing programs in good standing should be given a stronger priority in the recompetition process, whether that is by only recompeting under-performing programs such as in the Head Start program or by utilizing a prior experience point system such as in the TRIO programs. Through serving their communities for many years and in some cases decades, these existing programs have established strong ties in their communities on which many seniors rely and from which many others  benefit. I remain concerned that the language in the base bill will create a recompetition process that will essentially become a grant-writing competition without consideration for current RSVP programs' experience and effectiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I remain concerned about the recompetition process for RSVP programs, I intend to support the bill and urge my colleagues to support it as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak to the manager's amendment to <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill>, Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act, the GIVE Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairwoman of the Healthy Families and Communities Subcommittee, I am pleased to offer a bipartisan manager's amendment to <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill>. I am also pleased to say that the administration and the service community support the GIVE Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to again thank Chairman Miller for his continued support  and work on this reauthorization. I would also like to extend my thanks to the ranking member of our committee, Mr. McKeon, for his work. Finally, I would like to thank the ranking member of my subcommittee, Mr. Platts, for his work on this reauthorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also would like to thank the staff who have worked many hours on the bill. For the majority, Deborah Koolbeck, Denise Forte, and Alexander Ceja, and for the minority, Brad Thomas and Susan Ross.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment increases the ability of the Corporation for National and Community Service to tap into the pool of potential volunteers, which gives us a better opportunity to meet challenges facing our Nation's communities today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the changes in the manager's amendment include: the amendment improves the reach and capacity of the Summer of Service. This program is aimed to increase civil responsibility and community service among 5th-12th graders through summer service-learning programs. Getting younger kids involved in service is a good investment. Studies show that the earlier we get folks involved in the volunteer service the more likely they will stay in for their lifetime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have improved the National Civilian Conservation Corps, or the NCCC. This valuable program has a focus on disaster preparation. NCCC and volunteers have helped during disasters like Katrina. Because of the disaster focus, there is a need for supervisors and training instructors with a background in law enforcement, rescue and emergency and disaster preparedness. The amendment allows retired law enforcement, fire and rescue personnel to be part of the management of the NCCC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment makes the Retired Senior Volunteer Program a competitive grant program by 2013. I believe competition spurs innovation, and this will strengthen the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also included in this amendment are incentive grants for the Senior Corps program. These grants are designed to bolster the capacity of current exceptional Senior Corps programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given that the RSVP program is becoming a competitive process, it is expected that the RSVP programs which meet the eligibility requirements will be a majority of incentive grant applicants and recipients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I have also worked with Mr. Altmire, Mr. Sestak, and Mr. Souder and have included changes that they suggested in the manager's amendment. I want to thank them for their great ideas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our national service laws were last authorized 15 years ago. We have worked with our colleagues across the aisle and with the service community to renew the spirit of service in our Nation through the GIVE Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope you will join me and support my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400321" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to commend the ranking member for offering this manager's amendment which makes several very important changes to the GIVE Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most importantly, this amendment includes the language that would allow the Corporation for National and Community Service to support individuals who fill national service positions in small organizations that do not receive AmeriCorps grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This language was originally proposed by Mr. Souder in committee, and the manager's amendment reflects the bipartisan approach and the bipartisan compromise that was reached to infuse more individual control and local flexibility into the national service programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, I would like to reference that this amendment injects fair competition into the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program by requiring all programs to be competitively reevaluated by fiscal year 2013. For too long, these programs have continued to receive funding without any effort to determine if those programs are successfully making a difference in their communities, and this amendment will ensure that this is no longer the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, I urge a "yes" vote in support of the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment which will enhance the GIVE Act by codifying our commitment to ensuring veterans can serve and be served within our national service programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of my amendment is to acknowledge the patriotism, commitment, and sacrifice made by members of the military and their families. In return for their service to our Nation, the least we can do is make sure that our national service programs are able to benefit veterans and military families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a bipartisan basis, the Education and Labor Committee chose to incorporate support for veterans in the GIVE Act. My amendment is a natural extension of that theme, and I hope it will garner the same bipartisan agreement as the underlying bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Already, the GIVE Act seeks to increase opportunities for veterans to serve and to increase the number of national service programs responding to the needs of veterans under AmeriCorps. My amendment enhances that effort by prioritizing services for and service by veterans throughout all of our national service programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us includes a set-aside within AmeriCorps to support programs for veterans. In addition, the bill includes a study of how veterans are served and how they can be served more effectively. These are positive first steps, but my amendment goes further. Under my amendment, the Corporation will be required to place a priority on applications that serve veterans or recruit veterans to serve. Rather than a fixed set-aside within a single program, this amendment will allow us to broaden  the reach of service by and in support of veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Corporation for National and Community Service is required to establish priorities when funding national service initiatives. This ensures a targeted, effective investment. Under my amendment, included among those priorities would be an emphasis on programs that recruit veterans into service opportunities, promote community-based efforts to meet the unique needs of military families while a family member is deployed, and promote community-based efforts to meet the unique needs of military  families when a member of a family returns from a deployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, this amendment requires the Corporation to report to Congress on its efforts to increase the number of veterans serving in AmeriCorps and other positions that are eligible for the education award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Veterans, particularly those recently deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, deserve opportunities to reintegrate into their communities through service programs funded under the national service laws. This amendment will increase those opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without this amendment, we will not have the necessary information to effectively increase veteran participation in national service positions or provide an educational award in exchange for citizen service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when our service men and women are sacrificing on our behalf around the world, we should be doing all we can to repay that sacrifice. My amendment will make it the explicit policy of the Federal Government to encourage the national service programs to focus more on the unique needs of those heroes and their families, and to encourage more veterans to take advantage of service opportunities under these laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GIFT Act is a solid, bipartisan reform package that will strengthen our national service laws to make them more accountable, efficient, and cost effective.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400257" topic="">
    <paragraph>One of the themes of the GIVE Act is to increase opportunities for veterans to serve in national service programs and to increase the amount of national service programs responding to the needs of veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At committee, two amendments were adopted to address these issues. First, we directed the Corporation to reserve 3 percent of funds allotted to AmeriCorps for competitive grant programs that focus on veterans, particularly those that are recently returned from a deployment, and their families. The second amendment required the Corporation to conduct a study of how the national service laws would better serve veterans and increase veteran participation and service, and to create a pilot program  based on that study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment builds up on those efforts. Under current law, States and corporations are charged with establishing priorities to determining the types of programs to be assisted under the national service law. This amendment would require States and the Corporation to include priorities for veterans when establishing priorities for the distribution of assistance under these programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those priorities would be geared towards programs that recruit veterans into service opportunities, promote community-based efforts to meet the unique needs of military families while a family member is deployed, and promote community-based efforts to meet the unique service of military families when a member of the family returns from a deployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In addition, this amendment encourages the corporation to report to Congress on its efforts to increase the number of veterans serving in AmeriCorps and other positions that are eligible for the educational award. Veterans, particularly those recently deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, deserve opportunities to reintegrate into their communities through service programs funded under the national service laws. This amendment will increase those opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when our servicemen and -women are sacrificing on behalf of our country around the world, we should be doing all we can to repay that sacrifice. This amendment will make it the explicit policy of the Federal Government to encourage national service programs to focus more on the unique needs of these heroes and their families and to encourage more veterans to take advantage of service opportunities under these laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I certainly urge its passage, and I thank Mr. McKeon for offering this. It's a very good piece added to our legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to offer a bipartisan amendment to the GIVE Act. The Matsui-Shays amendment makes needed changes to national service and carries with it broad support. Our amendment will combine the two separate State competitive funds and national competitive funds into one singular funding pool. This change will improve national service efficiency and effectiveness, while increasing collaboration between State and national interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every year organizations and the individuals they support are turned away from the grants they need because of high demand or simple administrative burdens. The current funding formula gives approximately one-third of the funding to the States based on population, approximately one-third to State competitive grants, and approximately one-third to a national competitive funding pool. Under the current formula, a high demand for State competitive grants means that State grant applicants are turned  away even if there are resources still available in the national pool and vice versa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, these deserving nonprofits and community service organizations spend far too many of their valuable resources navigating a confusing applications process and managing multiple grants. If this amendment passes, these precious resources will now be used to better serve their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At its heart the amendment ensures that grants are competitively distributed based on merit and that resources are used in the most efficient and effective manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that all of my colleagues will join Congressman Shays and myself, as well as the Governor-appointed State service commissions, national service organizations, leading nonprofits, and Members from both sides of the aisle in support of this valuable amendment.</paragraph>

I would also like to thank the work and dedication of Chairman MILLER, Ranking Member MCKEON, Subcommittee Chairwoman DAVIS, and Subcommittee Ranking Member PLATTS.  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe national service is one of the most productive, cost effective investments our government can make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the inception of the Corporation for National and Community Service, of which I was a co-author, more than 1 billion service hours have been generated by Senior Corps volunteers, more than 40,000 individuals have served through AmeriCorps, and more than 1 million high school students have participated annually in service-learning initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the wake of the September 11 attacks, natural disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and the increasing achievement gap in education, the call to serve is louder than ever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment will revise and improve the funding formula for AmeriCorps, which engages more than 40,000 Americans in service throughout the Nation, by combining State and national competitive funding streams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National service programs throughout the country believe this change will provide a better means of allocating this funding and will bring the highest quality programs to States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The change will also enable States to compete for more funding and provide States with more choices of programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Community service is about helping people, and it is also about gaining deeper understanding of each other and the world around us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through service, Americans of all ages gain a sense of commitment to their communities and their country, which will prove valuable for the rest of their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this amendment in order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of this valuable program.</paragraph>

SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This title may be cited as the "Congressional Commission on Civic Service Act".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 6102. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress finds the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) The social fabric of the United States is stronger if individuals in the United States  are committed to protecting and serving our Nation by utilizing national service and volunteerism to overcome our civic challenges.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) A more engaged civic society will strengthen the Nation by bringing together people from diverse backgrounds and experiences to work on solutions to some of our Nation's major challenges.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Despite declines in civic health in the past 30 years, national service and volunteerism among the Nation's youth are increasing, and existing national service and volunteer programs greatly enhance opportunities for youth to engage in civic activity.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) In addition to the benefits received by nonprofit organizations and society as a whole, volunteering and national service provide a variety of personal benefits and satisfaction and can lead to new paths of civic engagement, responsibility, and upward mobility.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 6103. ESTABLISHMENT.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There is established in the legislative branch a commission to be known as the "Congressional Commission on Civic Service" (in this title referred to as the "Commission").&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 6104. DUTIES.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) General Purpose.--The purpose of the Commission is to gather and analyze information in order to make recommendations to Congress to--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) improve the ability of individuals in the United States to serve others and, by doing so, to enhance our Nation and the global community;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) train leaders in public service organizations to better utilize individuals committed to national service and volunteerism as they manage human and fiscal resources;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) identify and offer solutions to the barriers that make it difficult for some individuals in the United States to volunteer or perform national service; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) build on the foundation of service and volunteer opportunities that are currently available.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Specific Topics.--In carrying out its general purpose under subsection (a), the Commission shall address and analyze the following specific topics:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) The level of understanding about the current Federal, State, and local volunteer programs and opportunities for service among individuals in the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) The issues that deter volunteerism and national service, particularly among young people, and how the identified issues can be overcome.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Whether there is an appropriate role for Federal, State, and local governments in overcoming the issues that deter volunteerism and national service and, if appropriate, how to expand the relationships and partnerships between different levels of government in promoting volunteerism and national service.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Whether existing databases are effective in matching community needs to would-be volunteers and service providers.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) The effect on the Nation, on those who serve, and on the families of those who serve, if all individuals in the United States were expected to perform national service or were required to perform a certain amount of national service.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) Whether a workable, fair, and reasonable mandatory service requirement for all able young people could be developed, and how such a requirement could be implemented in a manner that would strengthen the social fabric of the Nation and overcome civic challenges by bringing together people from diverse economic, ethnic, and educational backgrounds.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) The need for a public service academy, a 4-year institution that offers a federally funded undergraduate education with a focus on training future public sector leaders.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) The means to develop awareness of national service and volunteer opportunities at a young age by creating, expanding, and promoting service options for primary and secondary school students and by raising awareness of existing incentives.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) The effectiveness of establishing a training program on college campuses to recruit and educate college students for national service.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) The effect on United States diplomacy and foreign policy interests of expanding service opportunities abroad, such as the Peace Corps, and the degree of need and capacity abroad for an expansion.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) The constraints that service providers, nonprofit organizations, and State and local agencies face in utilizing federally funded volunteer programs, and how these constraints can be overcome.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (12) Whether current Federal volunteer programs are suited to address the special skills and needs of senior volunteers, and if not, how these programs can be improved such that the Federal government can effectively promote service among the "baby boomer" generation.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (c) Methodology.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) PUBLIC HEARINGS.--The Commission shall conduct public hearings in various locations around the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) REGULAR AND FREQUENT CONSULTATION.--The Commission shall regularly and frequently consult with an advisory panel of Members of Congress appointed for such purpose by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Majority Leader of the Senate.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 6105.

  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="TITLE VI--CONGRESSIONAL COMMISSION ON CIVIC SERVICE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, when Katharine Lee Bates wrote "America the Beautiful" in 1893, I believe her poetic lyrics were intended to express the goodness of the American people as much as the natural beauty of our great Nation. America was founded on the concept of helping one another, and that selfless spirit expresses itself in countless acts of goodness by ordinary Americans every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to harness that American spirit, and I want to make it a part of the American experience. Mr. Farr, Mr. Walsh, and Mr. Shays have joined me in putting this amendment together, and we had a bill previously, because we believe that making this possible for every American is really where we ought to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all benefit in countless ways from a Nation that is our home. I believe we owe something in return. But there are countless ways for every American to serve and give back to America, and America certainly could use their help. That's why we put this together as an amendment to establish a Congressional Commission on Civic Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want this commission to investigate ways to create a broader commitment to national service in order to strengthen our common sense of responsibility to our community, our Nation, and to each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The commission would hold hearings around the country to engage the American people and get their own ideas. Whether it's in schools or nursing homes or prisons or mental hospitals or in the forests or cleaning up beaches or whatever, we want to talk to the local people. The commission would report to Congress with recommendations on how to harness the power of one, that is, the power of American people to improve our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment is a first step. It is simply an authorization, and the Congress will need to follow up with an appropriation. It mirrors the legislation we introduced last year, <bill type="h" number="1819">H.R. 1819</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the process, we have worked closely with some of America's best organizations: Voices for Service Coalition, the National Peace Corps Association, Corporation for National and Community Service, and the State AmeriCorps Administrators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President John Kennedy once said: "Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country." From that came the Peace Corps and other organizations similar, and we want to recreate that sense of American expectation in this time. With this amendment we want to help America answer that question and the call.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today America needs the American people like never before to meet the challenges of a slowing economy, health care, education, conservation. The government can't do it all, and ordinary Americans can and in many cases already do much of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time to build on the success of our national service programs like AmeriCorps by considering bold proposals that compel, inspire, and enable us to tackle the challenges, big and small, that will always confront us. There is no shortage of ideas.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="TITLE VI--CONGRESSIONAL COMMISSION ON CIVIC SERVICE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am waiting for Mr. Farr, but we will see if he gets here in time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The recommendations produced by this commission would be a plan of action because it will look at three key areas: to improve the ability of Americans to serve, to improve our community here and abroad. It will also identify and offer solutions to the barriers that make it difficult to perform national service and volunteer. And, finally, we will look at ways to build the foundation of service opportunities that are currently available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the data collected from the Census Bureau, Americans over the age of 16 are volunteering at an historically high rate with 61.2 million, giving their time in 2006 to help others by mentoring students, beautifying neighborhoods, and restoring homes after disasters.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="TITLE VI--CONGRESSIONAL COMMISSION ON CIVIC SERVICE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Congressman McDermott and Congressman Farr, Congresswoman Matsui and the Committee on Education and Labor for all of their hard work on bringing this reauthorization to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment establishes a Congressional Commission on Civil Service. The Commission would identify ways to expand opportunities for volunteerism and national service in America. It would also recommend ways Federal and local governments can improve awareness and access to national service opportunities, encourage increased volunteerism and better train future public service leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe national service is one of the most productive, cost-effective investments our Government can make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased this amendment addresses the need for a public service academy, a federally-funded 4-year institution dedicated to training the future leaders of our country's public service sector. In the next 10 years, 90 percent of our nation's Federal executives will be over the age of 50 and nearing retirement. We need to ensure that this workforce is replaced with well-trained, invigorated graduates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Investing in service opportunities provides enormous returns to communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no substitute for the passion of our Nation's volunteers, who can be found mentoring students, building houses, assisting senior citizens or beautifying our national parks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Community service is about helping people, and it is also about gaining deeper understanding of each other and the world around us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through service, Americans of all ages gain a sense of commitment to their communities and their country which will prove valuable for the rest of their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this amendment in order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of this valuable program.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment would add a section at the end of the bill to express a sense of Congress that the Corporation for National and Community Service should attempt to coordinate the recruiting and assignment procedures of their various programs to allow senior citizens and their grandchildren to share volunteer opportunities and be assigned to the same geographic areas during their period of service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would note, Mr. Chairman, Marian McQuade, the founder of National Grandparents Day and a homemaker from Fayette County, West Virginia, held as one of her primary motivations of her advocacy for a National Grandparents Day, persuading the grandchildren to tap the wisdom and heritage of their grandparents. This amendment builds on the principles that evolved into National Grandparents Day by creating more opportunities to build bridges on an intergenerational basis and strengthen the family structure.  This amendment will honor grandparents and enhance the bond between grandparents and grandchildren while encouraging a lifetime of community service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>It seems somehow fundamental that AmeriCorps and Senior Corps work together to bring grandparents and grandchildren together to share memorable and rewarding experiences of community service together, strengthen bonds of family, and make the lives of fellow citizens brighter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this amendment today. This is a remedy for many of the pressures that we feel today on families, it's an attempt to unite generations, and it's an attempt to better coordinate two very important programs in the interest of fostering stronger families.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We support this amendment, as it seeks to support the fostering of service among generations of a family. It is easy to imagine the kind of benefits that grandparents and their grandchildren would gain by not only spending time together, but serving others. The earlier children are introduced to service, the more likely they will volunteer throughout their life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Speaking as a grandparent, and I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. English) for introducing this, when I take my grandchildren with me and I try to explain the work that I do, and to see them get involved and be interested in the work that I do I think is a great thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The volunteering work that we do, and we bring the grandchildren with us, it opens up their eyes for a number of reasons. A lot of the work that we do is serving in underserved areas and to be able to see that these young children, my grandchildren, 7 and 9, are out there in the community and seeing children less fortunate than them. But to take it back even then to their classroom and say maybe we can do something, when you have Grandparents Day in school with your grandchildren, and you're  fostering the sense of volunteerism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I thank the gentleman very much for bringing this to our attention. I certainly am in full support of it.</paragraph>

  <chair> It is the Sense of Congress that the Corporation for National and Community Service should make the maximum effort possible to coordinate with the National Endowment for the Humanities to provide opportunities for young people enrolled in NACS programs to collect oral histories form senior citizens in the communities where they serve. &lt;p&gt;</chair>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment creates a sense of the Congress that the Corporation for National and Community Service should make the maximum effort possible to coordinate with the National Endowment for the Humanities to provide opportunities for young people enrolled in national and community service programs to collect oral histories from senior citizens in the communities that they serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As cochairman of the Congressional Humanities Caucus, I have been actively advocating policies and programs to raise awareness of the role of history, literature, languages, and other humanities in Americans' lives. As we all know, studying our history, our culture, and our heritage can help provide a framework to guide our decisions as we confront challenging issues facing us now and into the future. It also gives us a national memory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we look back to the experience during World War II when the Federal Government employed many writers to do histories of local communities that now have become an important resource to us, recognizing that we are at a time when our greatest generation is now moving on and the opportunity to consult them could very well be lost in the near future, this is an opportunity that we must seize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, studying our history, our culture, and our heritage can be an important part of our future defining of who we are. We not only learn from museums and books, but we also learn from those who have lived in the past. For that reason, I think it's important for our youth to reach out to our knowledgeable elders who have lived through tougher times, who have fought and seen wars, and who have seen the transformation of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Close to 1,000 World War II veterans die each day. Many have never spoken of their experiences. During a time in their lives where many are lonely and yearning for an opportunity to have an exchange, this creates an opportunity for us to capture those memories and institutionalize them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To carry on the American tradition and living history, I urge the support of my colleagues for this amendment today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>We support this amendment, as it continues to support the integration of  priority for national service. Everyone gains when they speak to others from a different generation and learn how things have changed over the years. And yet, at the same time, how many things remain the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fostering communication between people increases the connection for all of the community. This piece will add a section to the bill that is the sense of Congress that the Corporation for National and Community Service should make the maximum effort possible to coordinate with the National Endowment for the Humanities to provide opportunities for young people enrolled in NACS programs to collect oral histories from senior citizens in the communities they serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I would like to yield 2 minutes to Mr. ANTHONY WEINER from New York.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400426" topic="TITLE VI--SENSE OF CONGRESS">
    <paragraph>I thank the sponsors of this legislation and of the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this is an opportunity for us to expand on the notion that many Americans already support, and that is the idea that Americans very much want to be asked to help, they want to be asked to volunteer, they want to be asked to serve. Despite the conventional wisdom about growing apathy in the country, studies have actually shown that almost 30 percent did volunteer work in 2006, up dramatically since 1989, the last time the survey was asked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We found when asked is government, is Washington, is our country asking enough of us, overwhelmingly Americans say no, we are not being asked to do enough. Unlike the period after Pearl Harbor when FDR famously called us all to this national sense of calling, we failed to do it. The bill that we have today hopefully will reverse that to some degree and get more people involved doing more things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things the bill does that is most laudable is expands outreach to let cities, localities, and organizations know the program has grown much more flexible over the course of years. I believe that cities should be thinking about their own version of kind of a city version of AmeriCorps, addressing specific problems, maybe not as general as the AmeriCorps program is, where we have many people going, doing discrete individual things, but create programs that cities say let's try to tackle  the problem of child hunger, let's try to tackle the problem of affordability. This type of a program would allow cities to take more control, something that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not that long ago, I gave a speech in May, where I laid out a proposal in something I called AppleCorps, that New York City would come up with their program to take advantage. The idea would be if you get cities involved, maybe we can get them to put money in on top of what we in the Federal Government are offering to tackle those challenges that they face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing is very clear, that when Roosevelt once famously asked, "Now that we are in this war, we are all in it, all the way. Every single, man, woman, and child is a partner in the most tremendous undertaking of our American history. We must share together the bad news and the good news, the defeats and the victories." This bill seeks to do that.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Board of Directors of the Corporation for National and Community Service shall coordinate with veterans organizations serving veterans with disabilities to provide opportunities for young people enrolled in existing NACS programs to provide transportation services on a full-time, part-time, or as-needed basis.&lt;p&gt;</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the freedom of the United States has depended on the courage of men and women in uniform for over 200 years. Our veterans, having served as a member of the greatest military in the world, can be assured that they have the appreciation and admiration of millions of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The experience gained from the U.S. military is without a doubt invaluable, and I applaud our veterans for the courage and the commitment that they have demonstrated consistently while serving our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that said, I would like to offer this amendment, which will provide a valuable service to our veteran population while giving young volunteers an opportunity to be exposed to some of these American heroes that have allowed us to exercise our everyday freedoms. Specifically, my amendment would require the Board of Directors of the Corporation for National and Community Service to work with the Disabled American Veterans organization to provide opportunities for young people to serve as drivers  in the DAV transportation network.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new service will certainly help ease the burden on veterans throughout the country, especially in communities like mine and in yours, Mr. Chairman, in rural areas where we have many veterans who have a challenge getting the service that they need from our brick and mortar VA institutions, give them easy and convenient transportation to doctor appointments, physical therapy, and routine checkups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, at a time when America's veterans are facing increased challenges regarding health care coverage and full access to the benefits that they have earned, Congress ought to embrace commonsense policies that will help ensure our veterans get the care they need and deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my part of Pennsylvania, Mr. Chairman, it has been a challenge to drum up the volunteers to provide driver service for many of our VA participants and clients. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this initiative that will help fill that gap and encourage more of our young people to volunteer to help some of our aging veterans and some of our younger veterans who happen to live a distance away from the institution that serves them.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I want to thank, again, my colleague Mr. English from Pennsylvania for this amendment. This would require the Board of Directors of the Corporation for National and Community Service to coordinate with veterans organizations serving veterans to provide opportunities for young people to enroll in existing NACS programs to serve as drivers in the DAV transportation network on a full-time, part-time, or as-needed basis. The reason we support this amendment,  which is similar to Mr. McKeon's in a way, is that it will help serve our Nation's veterans. This amendment reminds us of the challenges faced by disabled veterans after they have devoutly served our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I see a lot of my veterans back home in Long Island, a lot of them do volunteer their time on driving our veterans back and forth. We only have one veterans hospital on Long Island. A lot of these drivers are as old as  those they are driving. So to see that our young people, and I can see something like this, which would be terrific for our young college students and our seniors that are driving, to be able to be part of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was earlier mentioned by Mr. Shays that with the war in Iraq, no one has asked Americans to be helpful. Well, this is a perfect time. This is where our young people can feel that all right, here we have our veterans that have done a gallant job on protecting this Nation. Help them now. Let us help them to get back and forth for their physical therapy or any treatments that they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's also a wonderful opportunity for our young people to get to know our seniors and our veterans that have served this country. The more I think about this, I am sorry that we didn't think of this amendment while we were having our committee hearings. I think next time I will reach out to my colleague and say what ideas do you have so we can bring them to the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, again, I support this amendment. I think it's a terrific amendment. I think it's a wonderful time for our young people and our seniors and our veterans to get to know each other. They will actually find they have a lot more in common than they do have apart.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, communities across this Nation are being devastated by home foreclosures, and my home State of Ohio has been particularly hard hit. This crisis has not stemmed from a single cause, and mitigating its effects will not be achieved with a single solution. Housing problems stem from predatory lending practices, job losses, and situations such as death, divorce and health emergencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important, Mr. Chairman, that we pursue innovative solutions to deal with this. This includes tying the provisions of Volunteerism and Service-Learning grants to programs that will serve areas that have been adversely affected by the mortgage crisis. This amendment would require the Corporation for National and Community Service to consider whether an area has a mortgage foreclosure rate greater than the national average when considering grant applications from States and other eligible  entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a time when so many of our communities are struggling, we need to pursue every avenue to make sure that the cities and towns with the greatest needs have access to the most assistance.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment and would associate myself with the maker of the amendment's statements regarding the importance of helping those who are facing challenges because of the housing crisis. This amendment recognizes that communities that are particularly hard hit by this crisis may be in need of special national service efforts. I thus support the amendment and encourage a yes vote.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400257" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague. Let me say that my colleague is having a problem with her voice with laryngitis, so I am actually going to be speaking for her from her talking points. So I will continue talking about Ohio, which has been particularly hurt by the current mortgage foreclosure crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a ranking of metropolitan areas with the highest foreclosure rates, Ohio has the sad distinction of having four areas in the top 20. Northeast Ohio, which includes Lorain and Elyria in her district, had the sixth highest rate. Nearly 3 percent of all households in these cities are in some stage of foreclosure, a 112 percent jump from 2006. Akron came in at 12, Dayton at 15 and Toledo at 19.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current subprime mortgage crisis has not stemmed from a single cause, and mitigating its effects will not be achieved with a single solution. Housing problems stem from predatory lending practices, job losses, and situations such as death, divorce and health emergencies. We must pursue innovative solutions, and this includes trying the provisions of volunteerism and Service-Learning grants to areas that have been adversely affected by the mortgage crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would require the Corporation for National and Community Service to consider whether an area has a mortgage foreclosure rate greater than the national average when considering grant applications from States and other eligible entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, more than 1.5 million individuals serve our country through the service programs that were created by the National and Community Service Act. In a time when so many of our communities are struggling, we need to pursue every avenue to make sure that the cities and towns with the greatest needs have access to the most assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We expect this amendment is going to be noncontroversial, but they may argue that it is duplicative because of the factors that are already included. The areas affected by high foreclosure rates would likely also be areas with high concentrations of low-income persons and high unemployment rates. But when we look at this, we see that by including this additional factor we will focus the Corporation on awarding grant funding to programs that address the specific needs of communities affected by  the foreclosure crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you look at this particular amendment, the Corporation for National and Community Service administers the National Service Trust Program, which provides funding for service programs, community groups, youth groups, service-lending, campus-based programs, pre-professional training programs and other services, one of the criteria the Corporation is required to consider when evaluating applications for funding is the extent to which projects would be conducted in the areas where they are needed  most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Factors already considered are communities designated as empowerment zones or redevelopment areas; targeted for special economic incentives; designated as having high concentrations  of low-income people; areas that are environmentally distressed; areas that are adversely affected by Federal actions related to the management of Federal lands that result in significant regional job losses and economic dislocation; areas adversely affected by reductions  in defense spending or closure of bases; areas with unemployment rates greater than the national average for the 12 most recent months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment will add another factor that the Corporation must consider when determining what constitutes an area.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as we heard with the last amendment, Ohio and many other States have suffered tremendous job losses in recent years. These workers and their families deserve our support, and they deserve creative and innovative thinking and policies from us as their representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Programs such as AmeriCorps and Senior Corps have done so much to provide opportunities for our youth and seniors. It is time now that we investigate ways to provide similar opportunities for Americans who have lost jobs through no fault of their own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would require the Corporation for National and Community Service to conduct a study to identify specific areas of need for displaced workers and how existing programs and activities carried out under our national service laws can better serve displaced workers and communities affected by plant closings and job losses. The amendment also requires the Corporation to develop and carry out a pilot program based on the findings of the study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, workers who have toiled for so long in manufacturing plants have much to offer their communities with their unique skill sets and leadership capabilities. I look forward to seeing how new service programs would reinvigorate America's displaced workforce with a sense of new purpose, so that they may continue to explore new career opportunities and continue contributing to our communities.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I do rise in support of this amendment. This amendment is similar to a study and pilot program dealing with veterans that was authorized through an amendment that passed in the committee. While I hope that as this bill moves forward we do not end up with studies and pilot programs for so many different areas that we lose our focus on the bill's priorities, I do believe that it is appropriate activity for the corporation to undertake this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In general, unemployment remains extremely low by historical standards, despite concerns about the economy. However, for those communities such as the maker of the amendment referenced in her home State of Ohio that are experiencing unusually high job losses, it would be wise to explore ways to target national service efforts towards addressing those concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, I support the amendment, and encourage a yes vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412228" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the support of the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania. I thank him for his work on this bill. It is greatly appreciated by the people I represent.

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Good data collection is so important, because with data we can determine how to better implement programs and better serve the needs of our Nation's citizens. As workers must find ways to obtain new skills or transition into a new career, this study will provide us with important information. Service can be a bridge between one phase of life to another or from one career to another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not a secret to anyone that Ms. Sutton's home State of Ohio has suffered tremendous job losses in recent years. From the year 2000 to 2007, Ohio has lost more than 209,000 non-farm jobs, the biggest 7 year drop since the end of the Great Depression. These workers and families deserve our support, and they deserve creative and innovative thinking and policies from us as their representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This study and pilot program require the Corporation for National and Community Service to examine how to use community service programs to provide opportunities for displaced workers. Programs such as AmeriCorps and Senior Corps have done so much to provide opportunities for our young and our seniors. It is time that we investigate ways to provide similar opportunities for Americans who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Workers who have toiled for so long in manufacturing plants have much to offer their communities, and their unique skill sets and leadership capabilities should not go to waste when plants close. I look forward to seeing how new service programs would reinvigorate America's displaced workforce with a sense of purpose so they may explore new career opportunities and continue contributing to all their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Corporation for National and Community Service has proven itself to be an entrepreneurial, innovative and effective organization. This amendment will lead the Corporation in a new direction to consider how the programs they provide funding to can do better serve the needs of America's displaced workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our national service laws provide funding for numerous worthy organizations such as AmeriCorps, Senior Corps, Habitat for Humanity, City Year, Boys and Girls Club, Teach for America, and Youthbuild. This amendment will spur new programs that address the needs of our displaced workers and their families.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, Ronald Reagan once said, "No matter how big or powerful government gets and the many services it provides, it can never take the place of volunteers." I believe that wholeheartedly. But listening to the debate today, you might easily conclude that volunteerism wasn't discovered until Congress discovered it, and that the only meaningful service that anyone can provide is in a program sponsored by government. We all know that that is simply not the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In truth, the programs that are being talked about today, the government-sponsored programs, make up probably less than one-hundredth of 1 percent of all the volunteer activity that takes place across this country. But when we have community service and volunteer positions, when we end up financing them or providing incentives from government, it becomes just another government service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The new Summer of Service grant program created by this legislation gives incentives to community service work in the form of financial benefits at taxpayer expense. The amendment that I am offering today would simply strike all the language in the bill relating to the so-called Summer of Service program and reduce the authorization by $20 million. This is the amount designated to the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new Summer of Service program would award $20 million annually for education awards for volunteer positions in which school-aged participants can earn up to $1,000 for completion of a 100-hour community-based service-learning project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we are all familiar with volunteer service that goes on: churches, Rotary Clubs, Boy Scout organizations. In fact, this weekend, 2 days from now, my own son will be doing his Eagle project. He will provide up to 30 hours of service himself, and more than 100 hours will be provided by people that he has recruited to help him in his project. This kind of activity goes on every day, every minute of every day, every second of every day. And yet, we feel that we have to have new and more government  programs somehow to prompt volunteer service. That, I think, sells people across this country short. People can volunteer on their own and do without benefits provided by government.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield myself 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose this amendment. When the National Community Service Act was enacted in 1990, we saw powerful new opportunities to inspire civic engagement and transformation in our communities. Last year, AmeriCorps' number reached 500,000, and today Learn and Serve Americans continue to support service learning for K-12 and college students making a vital connection between their academic studies and a real world application through their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, with the Summer of Service program, we can provide a new opening to reach many young people we know will benefit with the opportunities to spend a summer in service to their communities. It is a right of passage during grades 5-12.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this program grants educational awards of up to $500 to students who complete 100 hours of service over the summer months. By employing service-learning models to teach civic participation skills, the program will help young people serve their communities and expand educational opportunities for themselves and discourage what is commonly known as the summer academic slide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, 10 million students nationwide between the ages of 12 and 18 have participated in school-based service. Research shows that, among those students, teens from disadvantaged communities who serve hold more positive civic attitudes. Kids who engage in volunteering are more likely to be successful in school and avoid risky behaviors such as drugs, alcohol, and crime. Unfortunately, those disadvantaged teens who have so much to gain from the experience are less likely to volunteer than their  peers from more advanced backgrounds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When service is tied to what students are learning in school, young people make gains on achievement tests, complete their homework more often, and increase their grade point average. Students who engage in service learning improve communication skills, grow more aware of career possibilities, and develop more positive workplace attitudes, laying the foundation for America's future leaders. Yet, Learn and Serve's funding stayed the same at no more than $43 million since 1996, and decreasing over  the past several years. In Learn and Serve's last grant award cycle, they had 506 applications but only the resources for 102 awards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For generations, during times of great crisis and need throughout our Nation, students have stepped up and served their country and their communities. Today, again, our young people want to serve and are desperate to do their part, yet their call has gone unheard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 2001, there have been nearly 50 proposals involving national service before Congress, and not one has been enacted. Here we have a program that demonstrates our commitment to that great promise. A modest investment in Summer of Service is an important and long overdue step in providing service-learning opportunities for young people to start.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must do everything we can to help every child reach his or her full potential. We cannot teach our children until we honestly help them become engaged in their communities and give them the power to actively participate in their education. I urge a "no" vote on this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield time to my colleague from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412212" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise as well to oppose this amendment, which really overlooks the incredible positive impact that a summer of service can have on our youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Summer of Service is a program which fills a policy gap which helps communities create positive alternatives for young teens. The middle school years in particular are extremely pivotal years for young people. Most youth are making the difficult transition from middle school to high school, and many of them have no organized activities during those periods when they are out of school. Many are left unsupervised and at risk of being engaged in potentially harmful activity. We want to engage  them. We want to make sure that they have something to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was recently, Mr. Chairman, at a conference held in Baltimore that is focusing on what some refer to as the summer learning slide or summer learning lost. Basically, what do you do to engage students over those summer months to make sure that you are complementing the educational opportunities that they have during the regular school year? And the Summer of Service is a perfect opportunity to do that and to support them so that continuum, that trajectory is always upward. It is not a kind of  roller coaster where you get two steps forward and you slip one step back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How our youth spend their time during the summer period may determine whether they embark on a course of active citizenship and civic engagement and engaged learning or whether they go down a different path. This was a conclusion of a conference that the White House convened in 2000 to look at the issues that are facing teenagers. The Summer of Service initiative will offer youth the chance to spend a summer in service to their communities. I urge that we vote against the Flake amendment that  would eliminate the Summer of Service.</paragraph>

This is our own government telling us what our own programs are doing, and yet here we are under the Learn and Serve program authorizing $20 million more for a new program without trying to go in and actually fix the old program  or eliminate the old program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We in Congress sometimes wonder why our authorizing committees are sometimes neglected. This is why. This is why. This program, the whole AmeriCorps program hasn't been reauthorized I think since 1996 or so; and yet, when we do come to reauthorize it, we ignore what our own government, our own agencies are telling us about these programs and we simply pile more money on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No matter what we do on the overall bill, and I can read the writing on the wall, the bill is going to pass, let's at least give some thought to the taxpayers here who have to fund this, to say that we are not going to increase a program to create a new program under an existing program that has been rated by our own Office of Management and Budget as not performing, results not demonstrated.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400193" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise with Mr. Sarbanes to offer an amendment today that will establish an energy conservation corps program. This will provide green collar training and educational service grants to nonprofit organizations, universities, and State and local governments. This is really an exciting opportunity for us to create opportunities for young folks to be engaged in this new revolution of clean energy in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The energy conservation corps we envisioned will help revitalize communities and preserve and restore the environment, while also preparing young people for the responsible and productive lives we know they are going to have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 will create hundreds of thousands of new opportunities for Americans. It will give low-income young people training to fill these green collar jobs that we are now excited about and hope for a prosperous and successful future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conservation corps will fund energy conservation installations in public spaces, energy efficient green housing for elderly and low-income people, and restoration of historic structures on public lands. It would also provide funding for and repair, renovation, and rehabbing of existing infrastructure facilities, and transportation enhancements and recreational trail improvements. It is going to help a lot of places that we need energy conservation. It also establishes a competitive grant  program to fund National Senior Service Corps programs that will involve seniors in providing meaningful volunteer opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there are multiple organizations that can participate in this, one of which just as an example is the Student Conservation Association. Under this grant program, they will be able to deploy sustainable community projects which engage disadvantaged and other youth to help communities learn energy saving and water conservation techniques and strategies to prevent pollution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this program, SCA corps members will be able to provide a variety of energy-related services to homeowners, schools, and businesses, and communities. These services include outreach and education, facility audits, development of energy reduction strategies, and implementation in support of these programs. As part of this program, corps members will receive training, career development, and life skills while helping communities benefit from these sustainable programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am familiar with this organization, the SCA. My parents led Student Conservation Association efforts with young people in Mt. Rainier National Park back in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and I saw how important these programs were both to help these communities, and to help the young folks themselves. Because what we have learned is, and what I saw firsthand when my folks worked with the SCA kids, once kids get involved in volunteer programs, once they get involved in their communities, once  they get involved in clean energy, they are never going to turn back. This is going to be a lifetime pursuit, and there is nothing better we can do to help both kids' lives but this clean energy revolution we are going to launch in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, by establishing the energy conservation corps, we will help make our  Nation's volunteer programs into a true 21st century program, and we will also help solve one of the most pressing challenges of this century, global warming, while helping our kids as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to Chairwoman McCarthy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400257" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to say thank you to my colleague for offering this amendment, and I certainly fully support it. But I want to also address Mr. Flake's concern and clarify: While OMB conducted a part assessment on Learn and Serve, the Summer of Service initiative, what we are proposing is a new initiative that I believe has not been parted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with that being said, I think that when we look at the whole bill, and especially for the Summer of Service part, we have an opportunity to help our people, our young people during the summertime. This, to me, can certainly cut down on what we are seeing in our communities across this country right now, on more violence in our communities. We have to look at what is the underlying cause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that being said, we are certainly doing the most we can for the little amount of money that we have, to make the biggest impact on these children's lives. So with that being said, I certainly hope that when we come down to it that we will be against Mr. Flake's amendment and let this bill go forward, and let's help the young people, let's help our veterans, let us help everybody in this particular amendment. It is a good bill. It has been overwhelmingly supported on both sides of  the aisle, but this particular amendment, as far as I am concerned, would hurt too many of our young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>

  <speaking speaker="400193" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400321" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400321" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, while I certainly understand the focus and intent of this amendment, I rise in opposition and worry that this amendment will create more bureaucracy and administrative costs rather than focus on getting dollars out to the participants in the programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The focus of the GIVE Act is on streamlining our national service programs to make them more effective, efficient, and accountable. To do that, we have refocused a number of programs and added priorities to others to ensure that national service funds are being spent on initiatives that meet the most pressing needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have accomplished that by working within the existing program structures rather than piling new programs on top of existing programs with similar purposes. I share the gentleman's concerns in the area of energy conservation. I believe a better approach to this issue would have been to work within existing structures. In fact, this bill already does that by addressing energy usage and conservation in a number of areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Learn and Service, a new Summer of Service program, includes a focus on energy conservation. And in the innovative program section of that program, energy conservation is specifically included as a type of program eligible for funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the National Civilian Community Corps, energy conservation was specifically added as a new purpose for that program. And under the programs of national significance authority within the Senior Corps, energy conservation and environmental stewardship were added as types of programs eligible for funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obviously, infrastructure issues are found throughout the bill because we recognize that this is a priority in many locations. But establishing a new corps that will siphon away already scarce resources will only undermine the efforts of the amendment's sponsors to bring greater focus to these types of programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand this amendment authorizes $10 million for fiscal year 2009. Well, not within this specific act, but the Public Land Corps within the Department of the Interior already exists and is funded by the Federal Government at the amount of $2.5 million this year and it is authorized for $12 million. This program, the Public Land Corps, engages disadvantaged youth ages 16-24 in protecting public lands and the environment, including global warming and emissions reduction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So my opposition is not to the focus of the effort, but I believe we are being duplicative and are going to waste hours on administrative costs in creating a new program rather than investing these dollars in existing programs that will better focus on energy conservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would encourage a "no" vote, and ask Members to vote "no."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412212" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I just want to say that I am in strong support of this amendment. I am glad to cosponsor it with Congressman Inslee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The way we are going to make improvement with our environment is when hundreds of thousands of people develop the habits that clean up the environment instead of having the habits that hurt the environment. There is no better way to do this than to establish this Energy Conservation Corps which brings a service dimension for our young people and for our seniors in the Learn and Service programs to support this green frontier that we are embarked upon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think it is a critical boost to the other efforts that we are making on the energy horizon.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400321" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
