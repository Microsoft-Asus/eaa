    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor to address the energy situation as well and point something out that I don't believe has been very well illustrated here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This chart that I have, the inside circle is all of the Btus of energy that are consumed in the United States annually, 72 quadrillion Btus. The outside circle is all of the different sources of energy. Excuse me, this is the production chart on the inside. The outside circle is the consumption chart. We are producing only 72 percent of the overall energy that we are consuming. We need to grow the entire size of the energy pie. But if you take out of it all of the things that the environmentalists  don't want us to do, it leaves only a little bit of solar and wind and geothermal. That is only 0.74 percent of our energy production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They want to grow it into 100 percent of our energy production. That cannot be done. We have to grow all sources, not the tiny little sliver, three-quarters of 1 percent that the environmentalists would let us do. Let's go for all of it, as the gentleman from Illinois said.</paragraph>
