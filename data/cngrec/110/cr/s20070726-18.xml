    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed as under the previous order to debate Senator DeMint's motion to recommit the conference report and that following the vote on the DeMint motion, if his motion is defeated, the Senate vote on the conference report as under the previous order, with the debate time on the conference report reserved for after the votes; further that the time on the motion to recommit be reduced to 10 minutes equally divided.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I know we are all tired and we have agreed to cut this short. But this 9/11 Commission bill is very important and a part of it that we have talked about tonight and actually for the last year is port security. All of us agreed once again tonight that we should not allow convicted, serious felons to have access to secure areas of our ports. Unfortunately this amendment tonight was on an appropriations bill, and it restricted the use of funds for 1 year. We have  passed another time as part of the Safe Ports Act--94 to 2--to do this same thing: to take the Department of Homeland Security regulations they passed after careful study and codify it into law. But the 9/11 conference bill has come back to us and, once again, gutted that provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason it has been gutted is this: Once we pass this conference report the way it is, and it allows the Secretary to waive, to change, or to leave certain felonies that are listed, then it opens the whole regulatory process to lawsuit and challenge on a continuous basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have voted in the open tonight to stop that from happening, to stop convicted felons from working in secure areas of our ports. My motion tonight is very simple. It is to recommit this bill to committee to restore the amendment in the exact words that we have passed on the floor and to avoid the watering down and the gutting of a very important port security measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate has voted 93 to 1 tonight. The House voted last week on the same measure 354 to 66.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the 9/11 Commission bill does is allow the Secretary to eliminate or change listed felonies, allowing TWIC cards, these secure area cards, to possibly be given to those who have been convicted of smuggling, arson, kidnapping, rape, extortion, bribery, money laundering, hostage taking, unlawful use of a firearm, drug dealing, immigration violations, assault with intent to kill, robbery, fraudulent entry to a seaport or racketeering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are serious crimes. Although there is often talk of giving people a second chance, that second chance should not come at the expense of the security of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I send this motion to the desk, which they have, and ask for its consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will report.</chair>
  <narrative>The legislative clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] moves  to recommit <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, an act to provide for the implementation of the recommendations of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, to the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on such bill, with an instruction that the conferees on the part of the Senate insist on the matter contained in section 1455 of the Senate engrossed amendment, which prohibits the issuance of transportation security cards to convicted felons.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to recommit this bill. It is something that can be done quickly without delaying the final passage of this conference report, but it restores a very important provision we all voted on. I hope we can all support this motion to recommit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the remainder of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Who yields time in opposition?</chair>
  <chair>The Senator from Connecticut.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300067" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, with respect to my friend from South Carolina, I rise to urge my colleagues to defeat this motion to recommit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like all legislation that makes it out of both Chambers and onto the President's desk, this bill contains compromise. Compromises are at the heart of the legislative process, reconciling differences between the House and the Senate. In fact, this process is at the very heart of this remarkable system our Founding Fathers designed for us. So it was with this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In some cases, the House yielded to the Senate; in others, the Senate yielded to the House. That is why we have a conference report that, on balance, will greatly strengthen our homeland security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say to Senator DeMint that I supported his language in the original Senate bill. It was slightly modified in conference. That happens. But we ended up with language that had the support of both Democratic and Republican conferees in both the House and the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my opinion, the difference is not great. We simply give the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority, with his judgment as the protector of our homeland security, to decide when and if certain of these enumerated convictions ought not any longer to be a prohibition to working in our ports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I respect Senator DeMint's position, but what he has asked us to do is to recommit the bill and delay all of the improvements in security that come with the underlying bill. So my colleagues will have to answer the question about whether it is worth it, whether it is worth delaying provisions that will ensure better security against attacks on airplanes, better security with regard to maritime and air cargo, better security against terrorists entering this country via, for instance,  the visa waiver program, better technology and support for our first responders, and a provision to provide immunity from liability for citizens who see what they take reasonably and in good faith to be action that appears to them to be associated with a terrorist attack. We protect them from liability from those they are complaining against.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we do not pass this legislation tonight and enable the House to pass it next week, we are going to be delaying its movement to the President and its enactment into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I respectfully oppose the motion and ask my colleagues to vote against recommittal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair and yield back my remaining time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Who yields time?</chair>
  <chair>The majority leader is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have accomplished a lot today. We have had a few blowups but not for long. That is the way it is. For those of us who have been here a while, this reminded us all of how we used to legislate. This is fun for us legislators. It is great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am so happy we did not file cloture on this bill. We were able to work through it. I would say that we have earned tomorrow off. I am anxious the people who have the important trip to Greenland will be able to do that. We will not be in session tomorrow. The next vote will be on the children's health bill sometime Monday. We will do it Monday. The first vote will be at about 5:15 or 5:30 on Monday night. I think that should be about it. We will have this vote. We will finish this vote and one  more, and then we will have some speeches, and that will be it for the day.</paragraph>
