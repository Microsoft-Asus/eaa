    <paragraph>Mr. President, in the early morning hours of August 6, 2007, my home State of Utah, our home State of Utah--my distinguished friend and colleague, Senator Bennett, is with me today--suffered a seismic event at the Crandall Canyon mine in Emery County. These "mountain bumps" set up a chain of events that culminated in great tragedy and tremendous sorrow to all of our fellow Utahans and, I think, to many people across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a team of miners was working on its shift at the Crandall Canyon mine, the earth shifted and debris and ruin rained down trapping six men, all of whom have remained missing since August 6.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As news began to travel regarding the collapse and the lives in peril, crews began working to somehow, some way, free the six men. As one day turned into the next and hopes were lifted, just to sadly be dashed, one thing has remained constant: men and women from all walks of life have come together to fight for Manuel Sanchez, Kerry Allred, Luis Hernandez, Carlos Payan, Brandon Phillips, and Don Erickson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The list is long and varied of the many who have sacrificed and given their time, knowledge, and resources to help in this tragedy. The list includes officials from the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration; Murray Energy Corporation; the United States Air Force; Utah's Departments of Public Safety, Natural Resources and Human Services; the Utah Air National Guard; local, State and national government; and last but perhaps most importantly of all the men, women and children living in  the communities impacted by this tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As our State and Nation watched closely day after day for news of hope and rescue, we suffered another devastating blow the evening of August 16, 2007, when another seismic bump inside the mine buried rescue crews in coal and debris. As another new tragedy unfolded, many flew into action to now rescue the rescuers. People rushed to the scene to offer aid and valiantly try to save additional lives. Stories are told of miners using their bare hands to dig out buried miners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we heard the news of first one rescuer's death, then another, and another, it is difficult to describe the overwhelming sorrow and disbelief Utahns felt at the deaths of those who had risked everything for their co-workers, friends, and fellow miners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many were saved that evening, but sadly three lost their lives for others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dale Black was in the mine desperately trying to reach his cousin, Kerry Allred. In fact, he wasn't even supposed to have been in the mine that evening. He had been promoted the day before and would now be assigned as a rescue manager, working outside the mine. However, as Dale's brother Guy stated, "That's Dale. He wouldn't have let his guys go in without him."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gary Lynn "Gibb" Jensen from Redmond, UT, was an employee working for MSHA who was no stranger to mining. He had been in the mining industry in various capacities for 35 years and was described by others as someone who steered his career toward mine safety. He never hesitated to better the lives of his fellow "coal" miners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, Brandon Kimber, a father of a 5-year-old daughter and twin 4-year-old boys. He was relatively new to the mining industry, only working in the mines for 3 1/2  years. He was described as an unselfish, wonderful man who never hesitated to help others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dale Black, Brandon Kimber, and Gary Jensen will long be remembered for their selfless acts that day. These were three humble miners who are now three wonderful heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As our State and Nation grapples with this tragedy and looks for answers, I do not want us in our haste to solve this tragedy overlook the contributions miners and the mining industry has made to America for many, many years. We want to solve this tragedy, but we haven't been able to. The original six miners are still buried in the mine. We hope we can recover them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mining is a community, it is a brotherhood, and it helps fuel our economy and growth. Generations of Utahns from many of our communities have toiled in and helped propel the mining industry. Many men and women return home each evening with faces marred by coal dust, and tired bodies. However, to many Utahns mining is a way of life and their contributions to this important industry must always be appreciated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have traveled throughout our State and Nation, some of the most wonderful people I have met and talked with are miners. They are humble, they work hard, and they display courage each day as they enter the mines to make a living and support their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the communities bordering the Crandall Canyon Mine, you don't need to travel far to see a sign, a t-shirt, or some other display urging all to "save our miners," "pray for our miners," and "love our miners." I have witnessed first-hand the courage, fortitude, and heroism of many wonderful people to do all three save, pray, and love our miners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been saddened greatly by the events that have transpired in my home state throughout the past several weeks. The Crandall Canyon Mine collapse and tragedy will forever be remembered for the grief we shared as a State, and the valiant, and courageous efforts displayed by many. In the depths of this tragedy heroes emerged, and our faith in the human spirit lives on through the sacrifices made by many to comfort, and save the lives of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Bennett and I have introduced this resolution which has been agreed to, honoring the sacrifice of the miners and rescue workers and expressing the condolences of the Senate and our Nation to their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been almost blown away by the kindness of our fellow Utahns and the courage and strength of those who have tried to save these miners. I have appreciated the leadership of the mayors of both Huntington and Price who have stood so valiantly as rocks against the pain and suffering these good people have suffered. I am so grateful to know these people. My heart goes out to the families of these miners and, of course, their children. I hope and pray that somehow we can do a lasting memorial  for these folks who have died and who have worked so hard to try and support their families. I was happy to urge our colleagues to support this resolution, and I appreciate their support.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300007" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my senior colleague for the thorough and sensitive way in which he has described this Senate tribute to the families and the coworkers of the miners who were killed in the Crandall Canyon mine disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was there the day after the mine collapsed. The Governor was there as well. Senator Hatch was on his way and joined us later. We welcomed the assistant Secretary of Labor to Utah, and we examined with soberness and concern the facts surrounding the situation. We were not sure whether the miners had survived. There were reservations from those who were experienced with these kinds of mine problems. They were afraid the miners had, in fact, been killed in the initial blast. But we all  held out hopes that they could survive, and efforts were undertaken to determine whether they were alive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To show the ruggedness of the territory, there was no way to drill a significant hole into the mine immediately because there was no road up to the top of the mountain where the drill would have to be placed. So a smaller drill was brought in by helicopter and drilled a 2 1/2  inch hole through roughly 1,200 feet in an attempt to find out whether we could make contact with any survivors who might be there. A road was built, a larger drill was brought in and followed the 2 1/2  inch hole with  an 8 1/2  inch hole. Neither one produced any tangible evidence that the miners had survived.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the briefings we had from the experts onsite, we discussed what might be done further besides drilling the holes. They talked about the dangers connected with trying to dig into where the miners were. It was understood there would be no further attempt in terms of digging in until the seismic activity in the mountain had stopped. The mountain would continue to shift, and as it was shifting, the experts said: We will not undertake any attempt at further rescue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I subsequently learned they did make an attempt while the mountain was shifting. It was not a reckless attempt, although it was a heroic attempt. They believed they had sufficient protection from the rescue workers that they could get somewhere near where the miners had been trapped and find out if they were still alive, even while the mountain was still shifting. They applied fully known and reliable means of protection for the rescuers, and then the second tragedy occurred. Even with  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="11304">S11304</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This double tragedy has united the mine community in Utah in the ways Senator Hatch has described. And throughout the State of Utah, far away from the minefields, flags were flown at half staff as the people of our State joined together in mourning for those who had lost their lives in this tragic accident. Hearings have been held. We hope to learn as much as we possibly can, to continue to work as hard as we can as a nation to see that the deaths in the mining world continue to decrease,  but we recognize that whatever satisfaction we take from the fact that mining deaths have decreased over the decades, that still does not lessen the tragedy for those loved ones and coworkers who have seen this kind of death occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to join with my colleague Senator Hatch in cosponsoring this resolution and I thank the Senate for its unanimous support of the resolution and extend, once again, my personal condolences and sympathies for all of those who are personally touched by the tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must, as a Congress, do everything we can to see that this kind of tragedy is reduced to the point where, ultimately, it ceases to be.</paragraph>
