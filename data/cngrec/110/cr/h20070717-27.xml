    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, those who wear the badge of a peace officer do so with valor and the determination to serve their community. NYPD Officer Russel Timoshenko was one of those peace officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Officer Timoshenko chose to be an American citizen and legally immigrated to the United States from Russia in 1993. He followed the law to get here and then became a protector of the law as a member of New York City's Finest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Around 2:30 a.m., Tuesday, July 10, 2007 Officers Timoshenko and Herman Yan stopped an SUV on a dark New York City street. As the officers approached the SUV, the passengers turned and gunned down both officers. Officer Yan was shot in the chest and arm, and he will recover. Russel Timoshenko was shot twice in the face, and Saturday the 23-year-old officer died. He had been a New York City cop for only 18 months. Two outlaws have been arrested for murder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Officer Russel Timoshenko was the American Dream, a naturalized citizen who dedicated his life and service to American citizens. America can use more American immigrant citizens who wear the badge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
