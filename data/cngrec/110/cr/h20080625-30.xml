    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, with the Bush economy losing 325 jobs so far this year, it is important for the House to extend a financial lifeline to millions of unemployed workers, many in my home State of New Jersey and across the Nation, who are having trouble finding jobs. Today, 1.6 million Americans have exhausted all of their unemployment benefits. The numbers are expected to grow to more than 3 million Americans by the end of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, with strong support from both Democrats and Republicans, this House passed legislation giving workers and their families an extended 13 weeks of benefits so that they don't have to worry about losing their homes and their cars while they're looking for work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For weeks, despite continued bad economic news and huge job losses in the airline and auto industries, the White House actually threatened to veto the legislation. Fortunately, they have reconsidered, and they are now supporting that the unemployment insurance will continue.</paragraph>
