    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor the men and women that serve our Nation as military spouses. I greatly admire the strength, courage, and commitment of these special individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1984, President Ronald Regan recognized the vital importance and personal sacrifice of the military spouse by declaring the Friday before Mother's Day as Military Spouse Appreciation Day. The impact that the military spouse has on the readiness and effectiveness of today's all-volunteer Armed Forces cannot be overstated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, military spouses are rarely thanked or recognized for the vital role that they play in maintaining our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, more than 50 percent of our total force is married. Of the 1.12 million military spouses 92 percent are women, 78 percent are enlisted spouses, 57 percent are between the ages of 25-40 years, 73 percent have children, and 65 percent also work outside of the home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Armed Forces' current operational tempo has placed unique challenges and extraordinary strain on our military families. Months of waiting and late nights filled with worry about a forward deployed loved one can take a toll on the most steadfast and stout-hearted man or woman. Despite this intense strain, military spouses have remained committed and loyal to their servicemember and families. These men and women know the true meaning of sacrifice and devotion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, America says thank you to our loving military spouses.</paragraph>
