  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to recognize our Nation's first responders. I, along with Senators McCain and Casey, introduced <bill type="sr" number="215">S. Res. 215</bill> recognizing today, September 25, 2007, as National First Responders Appreciation Day. The Senate acted quickly and passed this resolution by unanimous consent with a total of 33 cosponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The contributions that our Nation's 1.1 million firefighters, 670,000 police officers, and over 890,000 emergency medical professionals make in our communities are familiar to all of us. We see the results of their efforts every night on our TV screens and read about them every day in the paper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From recent tornadoes in the Southeast and wildfires in the West in 2007, and the Christmas blizzard in Colorado in 2006, to the tragic events of Virginia Tech, Columbine High School, Platte Canyon High School, and the wrath of Hurricane Katrina, our first responders regularly risk their lives to protect property, uphold the law, and save the lives of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nationwide, many of our first responders take the call on a daily basis and are exposed to life-threatening situations. While performing their jobs, many first responders have made the ultimate sacrifice. According to Craig Floyd, Chairman of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a total of 1,649 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty during the past 10 years; an average of 1 death every 53 hours, or 165 per year, and 145 law enforcement officers were killed in 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, according to the United States Fire Administration, from 1996 through 2005, over 1,500 firefighters were killed in the line of duty, and tens of thousands were injured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also important to note that four in five medics are injured on the job. More than one in two, about 50 percent, have been assaulted by patients, and one in two, 50 percent, have been exposed to an infectious disease, and emergency medical service personnel in the U.S. have an estimated fatality rate of 12.7 per 100,000 workers, more than twice the national average, and most emergency medical service personnel deaths in the line of duty occur in ambulance accidents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet to recognize our first responders only for their sacrifices would be to ignore the everyday contributions they make in communities throughout America. In addition to battling fires, firefighters perform important fire prevention and public education duties such as teaching our children how to be fire safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Police officers do not simply arrest criminals; they actively prevent crime and make our neighborhoods safer and more livable. And if we or our loved ones experience a medical emergency, EMTs are there at a moment's notice to provide lifesaving care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Saturday, I hosted a first responder appreciation day in northern Colorado and was overwhelmed by the support shown to our first responders by the public. Farmers, ranchers, small business owners and members of the community alike thanked their firefighters, paramedics, sheriffs, deputies, and police officers for being there at a moment's notice to lend a hand while putting their own safety at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a practicing veterinarian and a former health officer in Loveland, Colorado, I can attest to the numerous times I called on first responders to help me get through a situation. In many ways our first responders embody the very best of the American spirit. With charity and compassion, those brave men and women regularly put the well-being of others before their own, oftentimes at great personal risk. Through their actions they have become heroes to many. Through their example they are role  models to all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To all of our first responders, thank you for your service. I ask my colleagues to please join me today in recognizing September 25 as National First Responder Appreciation Day as we honor first responders for their contributions, sacrifices, and dedication to public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
