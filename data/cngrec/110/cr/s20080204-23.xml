    <paragraph>Madam President, Mr. Irving Herrman, member to the "greatest generation," will be 90 years old on February 5, 2008. He was born in Akron, OH, the second of three sons of Armand and Therese Herrman and a first-generation American. His parents were Eastern European Jews who came to this country at the end of the 19th century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Herrman graduated from South High School in Akron and attended the University of Akron. He began working for Mr. Milton Radney until he joined the Army Air Corps and served during World War II; he was stationed in England. It was in England where he met his wife, Vera Grace Cressey. They married on March 19, 1945, and returned to Akron and then Cuyahoga Falls after the war, where they raised a beautiful family together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon returning to the Akron area, Mr. Herrman resumed his position with the Radney Cigarette Company where he managed the office. He remained with the company until he retired in 1982. He then worked parttime for H.R. Block until 1998. Mrs. Herrman died in 2000. Mr. Herrman loves his family dearly. He has two daughters and sons-in law, Brenda H. and Steven Lipp and Judith H. and Fred Jenkins; he has six grandchildren: Emily Lipp Sirota, Zach Lipp, Nate Lipp, Jake Plattner, Rachel Plattner and  Maggie Plattner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Herrman is an active and beloved member of the community. He has been a member of Temple Israel for over 50 years. He has been a longtime member of the Hakoah Club at the Jewish Community Center, holding every office in that organization, including president. He is also a member of the Jewish War Veterans, holding offices in that organization, as well. In his retirement, he volunteered at local hospitals. One of Mr. Herrman's favorite pastimes is bowling. He won many competitions and rolled  a 300 game in league play. He is also an avid ping-pong player and continues to enjoy golf and travel. But his favorite activity of all is spending time with friends and family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Herrman's life is one that represents the "greatest generation:" a life of family and service to country and community. It is people like Mr. Herrman who have built this country and made it great.</paragraph>
