  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when I was young, growing up, I would often ask my mother if I could go to my friend's house to play, and she would say no. And instinctively I would then say, well, Billy's mom lets him go. And my mom would then say, I know, but I am not Billy's mom and I don't care what Billy's mom lets Billy do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, that was an important lesson that I learned. Unfortunately, some of our courts have failed to learn that specific lesson, and that is why I feel honored to be able to stand here and talk about the Reaffirmation of American Independence Resolution, which my good friend, the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey, briefly introduced in his remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill states that "judicial determinations regarding the meaning of laws of the United States should not be based in whole or in part on judgments, laws or pronunciations of foreign institutions unless those foreign judgments, laws and pronouncements inform an understanding of the original meaning of the Constitution of the United States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, why would we do this? This only sounds logical. We are doing it simply because one Supreme Court majority admitted that they referred to laws of other countries and to international authorities as instructive for its interpretation of our 8th amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another case, the Court once again took into account the European Court of Human Rights in establishing the belief systems that they came up with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, you may ask, once again, so what? What does that mean?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Justice Scalia made a good answer on what that means. "It lends itself," as he said, "to manipulation." In fact, it invites manipulation. If I am a judge who wants, in some way, to overturn a decision, I need some reason for it. I have to sound in some way like an attorney. I need to cite something. You can't cite something that is American because what I am trying to do is overturn two centuries of American precedent. So you find some intelligent man living in Zimbabwe or Poland or somewhere  else in the world and cite his examples, and it looks very lawyerly. But it is, of itself, a manipulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Precedent is extremely important in our system of justice. Having a standard that does not change is important for the judge so that he realizes the standard he used in case A and case B will always be the same. It is even more important for citizens, for individuals, so that they know whether they go before judge one or judge two it will once again be the same standard that will be used in that situation. When we break those precedents, when we allow foreign precedents to take over, what we  are simply doing is opening up the process for arbitrary and capricious decisions to be made. We are not in the process of, as someone once said of evolving our standards of decency as a mark of the progress of the maturing society. Because as Justice Scalia again said, sometimes society does not mature; it simply rots.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the purpose of the Bill of Rights was to prevent change, not to encourage it, so that you leave people guessing as to what is appropriate, what is politically correct and what is indeed legal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Satchel Paige used to talk to young pitchers when they were trying to learn how to pitch and being too cute at the plate by hitting the corners and were walking people. And he simply said, "throw strikes. Home plate don't move."</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>If we allow the court system to base their decisions on foreign opinions as opposed to American precedent, then home plate moves and home plate moves in a way that hurts citizens of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there are some lawyers, maybe Supreme Court Justices, and others who would say that my comparison of my mom's reasoning to foreign law used in an American court would be inaccurate or oversimplistic. Perhaps so because, after all, they say, didn't our Founding Fathers look to foreign law when they were forming the Constitution? Indeed, if you read the Federalist Papers, you will see lots of references to the Swiss system and the German system. It is full of it. But the issue at hand is,  once the Constitution is established, then our job is to try to understand what it meant when it was adopted, not search for some hook to find an alternate opinion for personal reasons or personal pique. Now, that is the key.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We shouldn't care what Billy's mom or foreign courts let Billy do because our court is not Billy's mom.</paragraph>
