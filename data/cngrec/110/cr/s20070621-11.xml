    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today about the passage of <bill type="h" number="1429">H.R. 1429</bill>, the Head Start for School Readiness Act. This bipartisan legislation reauthorizes the Head Start program, something the Congress has not done since 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson launched a summer program for low-income children and their families, and called it Project Head Start. The program's mission was simple: prepare low-income, preschool-aged children for success in school. Today, Head Start serves children and their families in urban and rural areas across the United States. And, since its inception, more than 20 million children and families have benefited from the Head Start program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevada's eight centers range from a Head Start and Early Head Start Center in rural Ely, to larger, more urban centers in Reno, to a Tribal Head Start center in Gardnerville. Each of these programs is unique and, with the input and involvement of parents and families, help meet the needs of the communities they serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Head Start currently provides comprehensive early education and health services to almost one million low-income preschool children to help them prepare for and succeed in school. Unfortunately, this is only a fraction of the number of children that could benefit from Head Start services. In my own state of Nevada, there are just under 10,000 3- and 4-year-olds that are eligible for Head Start programs. But, last year, only about 27 percent of those eligible were able to participate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that we have passed will allow many of these children in Nevada and across the Nation to get the early childhood services that they need, by expanding access and eligibility for low-income children and families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation also makes a number of other important changes to the Head Start program. It focuses on developing the skills that children will need to enter school ready to learn by aligning Head Start standards and services with state child care and preschool programs and local public schools, and requiring new research-based standards and assessments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, to ensure that Head Start programs are effective, the bill requires greater accountability through improved monitoring and recompetition for poor performing Head Start centers. Finally, this bill strengthens the Head Start workforce by setting new education and training goals for Head Start teachers and curriculum specialists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With proven and lasting results, Head Start is a wise investment in our future. I applaud the good work of the HELP Committee, and thank Senators KENNEDY, ENZI, DODD, and ALEXANDER for their efforts on behalf of low-income children across the Nation.</paragraph>
