  <narrative>The legislative clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>A resolution (<bill type="sr" number="339">S. Res. 339</bill>) expressing the sense of the Senate on the situation in Burma.</narrative>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I support the resolution offered by Senator Kerry on the current crisis in Burma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his April 16, 1963, letter from a jail cell in Birmingham, AL, Dr. King wrote that "freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor, it must be demanded by the oppressed."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Burma, are demanding freedom. They are peacefully marching in the streets to demand freedom from an oppressor that is one of the world's worst human rights abusers. They are demanding freedom from a government that restricts the basic freedoms of speech and assembly, engages in human trafficking, discriminates against women and ethnic minorities, uses children as soldiers and laborers, imprisons arbitrarily, abuses prisoners and detainees, and rapes and tortures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This military junta is now engaged in an attempt to violently suppress the Burmese people who refuse to be silenced anymore. Those who have taken to the streets are doing so at great personal risk. Thousands were killed in a similar uprising in the summer of 1988. This brutal regime is responsible for the destruction of 3,000 villages and the displacement of 2 million people. The people of Burma are saying enough is enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. King also wrote from his jail cell that "injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere." That is why this resolution is so important and why I am so proud to be a cosponsor. It sends a strong message to those marching in the streets of Rangoon and Mandalay that the United States is witness to what is happening. It also says that the United States is working to rally the international community behind the Burmese people as they strive for justice after years of oppression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution recognizes that we can all play a positive role in bringing justice and peace to Burma, and that we must work with the international community to pressure the Burmese Government to lift restrictions on humanitarian aid. It also calls on the United Nations to play a unique role in furthering dialogue toward reconciliation and concurs with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations decision to demand an end to the violence, the release of all political prisoners, and a political  solution to the crisis. Finally, this resolution rightly urges that China end its military assistance to the Burmese regime, and that it no longer block the efforts of the United Nations Security Council to condemn the oppressive action of the Burmese junta.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to end with a quote from the icon of freedom in Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi: "We will prevail because our cause is right, because our cause is just ..... History is on our side. Time is on our side."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must continue to stand beside the people of Burma in that cause.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>I wish today to denounce the savage actions of Burma's military government. During this past week, a familiar pageantry of riot police and soldiers deployed to stop the peaceful demonstrations of Burmese monks and citizens. These protestors demanded an end to the dictatorship which has governed Burma for most of the past 4 1/2  decades. They carried no weapons, incited no violence, and made no demands beyond those which constitute basic human freedoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their military junta reacted as that government always has: with silence, with threats, and then at last with violence. I had hoped that the course of these protests would not conform to Burma's old pattern of repression. So often in this decade we have seen the forces of peaceful revolution triumph over the institutional relics of an earlier, more brutal age. In Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan the old regime was toppled with barely a hint of violence. Elsewhere, like Lebanon, strident democratic  blows were struck against the ruling order. I remember not two decades ago, when the Soviet Union peacefully dissolved, its citizens having had finally enough of communism, misery, and the KGB.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, these bloodless successes are not always the norm. Events in Uzbekistan and Belarus have shown us--as did Tiananmen Square 18 years ago--that governments which are serious about holding power do not topple easily. They draw on their full arsenal of modern repression, from electronic surveillance and torture to indiscriminate beatings and murder. This is what has happened in Burma. We hoped for a bloodless success, and we are rewarded with a bloody failure. For me, this is particularly  hard to bear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been involved with Burmese political issues throughout my tenure in the Senate. I have cosponsored numerous bills and resolutions condemning Burma's military tyranny and its human rights record. Congress after Congress, session after session, I have pushed for stricter sanctions on the Burmese regime. In 2003, I was a cosponsor of <bill type="s" number="1215">S. 1215</bill>, the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, which cut off all imports to the United States from Burma and authorized support for Burmese democratic activists.  I likewise supported <bill type="h" number="2330">H.R. 2330</bill>, the House version of that act which was eventually passed into law. Just this past summer, as I have done repeatedly before, I cosponsored a bill renewing the sanctions of the Freedom and Democracy Act. In October 2001, I voted for S.A. 1933 to the Foreign Operations bill, denying Burma outside aid unless Rangoon changed its behavior. And in March 2005, I introduced <bill type="sr" number="91">S. Res. 91</bill>, which urged China to stop enabling Burma with military support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear, however, that there is a limit to what my colleagues and I can effect from our seats in Washington. The regime which rules Burma is nearly impervious to outside pressure. The true wielders of influence--such as China and India--have been effectively silent thus far on the junta's latest brutalities. And so today, the Burmese protests have ended much the way I feared they would. There has been no peaceful overthrow of the government. There is now only the sight of thousands of soldiers  patrolling the streets, the monks locked in their monasteries, Internet and broadcast communication nearly cut off. We will probably never know how many dissidents were thrown into jail over the past week. We have only the haziest idea of how many Burmese were killed. A regime deserter--a government intelligence officer--claims that thousands were killed. We do know that Japan has confirmed the death of one of its nationals, a photographer who was caught up in last  week's events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I imagine that Aung San Suu Kyi herself, however, would have more mixed feelings. Her father fell shortly before achieving a free nation. I imagine that such is her dedication, his daughter might readily accept the same bargain. Ten years ago, when her husband was dying of cancer in London, Suu Kyi was offered the opportunity to go visit him. It was an agonizing choice. On the one hand, she was compelled to be with her husband in the last days of his life, a man she had been prevented from seeing  for years. On the other, she had absolutely no doubt that once she left the country the regime would not allow her to return. It is not inappropriate to acknowledge here that the generals ruling Burma are clever, having survived many threats to their rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot begin to imagine how heartrending that decision was. Aung San Suu Kyi has sacrificed almost everything for her country. I have little doubt that at some point, perhaps not far in the future, the regime will decide to take her life as well. As long as the military junta is in power, Suu Kyi and other brave Burmese who dream of freedom face a bleak fate. Watching the monks' showdown with police over the past week, she must have hoped against hope that this time would be different. It would  not be like 1988. Today there is the Internet, satellite television, and digital cameras to shame the generals into restraining their response. Sadly, and perhaps predictably, they did not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a few more weeks, the world will go back to its other interests. The U.N. envoy will make desultory progress in achieving his political solution, and he will go home. But the Burmese people know, as I do, that a political solution is unlikely. The military junta has stayed in power through brute force, though it sought legitimacy from Burma's monasteries. After last week's beatings and killings of those monks, that relationship is shattered. Stripped of its last veneer of legitimacy, the government  will fall back on its guns. But for its weapons, and its will to rule, this regime would long ago have gone the way of other bunker regimes, and today be little missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The one weapon it does not have, however, is time. Sooner or later, all tyrannies collapse. The effort of repression is ultimately self-immolating; and then the regime's only lasting historical legacy will be the misery it has inflicted. For the Burmese people, who suffer through this misery and resist the best they can, life will be unbearably harsh. I believe they will continue to resist regardless. My colleagues and I will assist them however we can, in whatever small way is open to us. And  one day, when the orange robes of the monks line the streets once more and the troops are nowhere to be found, we shall have victory, and a new day will break over Burma. They--and I--await that day.</paragraph>
