    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to my good friend, the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring about next week's schedule.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour business and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. There will be no votes before 6:30 p.m. on that Monday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Tuesday next, the House will meet at 10:30 a.m. for morning hour business and noon for legislative business. We will consider additional bills under suspension of the rules. A complete list of these bills will be available by the end of the week. We also expect to consider <bill type="h" number="1401">H.R. 1401</bill>, the Rail Security Act, out of the Homeland Security Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Wednesday and Thursday the House will meet at 10 a.m. On Friday, no votes are expected. We will consider <bill type="h" number="1538">H.R. 1538</bill>, the Wounded Warriors Assistance Act, and the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>The gentleman said he expected that budget resolution to be on Friday?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>On Thursday. I do not expect that we will be meeting on Friday, unless debate occurs longer than I expect. But otherwise we will not be meeting on Friday.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Does the gentleman have a sense on the rule on the budget? Will there be substitutes allowed? What is the gentleman's sense on that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will tell the gentleman my sense is that substitutes will be allowed.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, we traditionally have allowed substitutes. I will express to the gentleman my disappointment in the rule on the bill we just passed, which as far as I know is the first closed rule on an appropriations bill since 1992. And the previous appropriations bill was largely closed, and I hate to see us headed down that path. I think it is going to be much harder to get our appropriations work done. I know our appropriators are concerned that a long-standing tradition on appropriations  bills has been violated, and I hope we don't see that same thing happen on the budget resolution coming to the floor next week.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentleman's observations. I understand his concern. Although I do observe that there was no motion made to either add or subtract from the bill that we just considered in a motion to recommit. But I do expect substitutes will be made in order.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I think the gentleman's suggestion that if we don't take advantage of whatever small parliamentary procedure we are allowed, that somehow that justifies not allowing us any amendments on the bill is not a very good excuse for that. I hope that we don't continue to see that happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was concerned about the CR and the way it was handled. I was concerned about this bill. The next logical step, when we get to the appropriations bills, is that they, too, would not have the opportunity for debate and amendment as this was, in violation of long-standing traditions in the House. The last time this happened was when the gentleman's party was in the majority, and I hate to see us revert back to that lack of debate. I hope the gentleman will work with me and others to try to do  everything we can to move the process along, not only rapidly, but also appropriately.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Would the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having been in the gentleman's position for too long, I honestly empathize with his position. It is my expectation that the appropriation bills, as they have historically, will come to this floor starting mid-May and continuing through June, and we hope to complete our appropriations bills by the end of June. My expectation is they will be, as they are traditionally, on the floor with open rules, or at least structured rules. Obviously, open rules, if you have 500 or 600 amendments from all   the folks, we may not get finished, which is why we have structured rules. But certainly the gentleman is correct that that is the tradition. I would expect us to follow that tradition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On supplementals, over the last 15 supplementals, I was looking around to see if I had it immediately in front of me, I don't, but on the last 15 supplementals there have been a variety. Seven of them were open, eight of them were less than open, some more structured than others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the gentleman's representation, and I certainly look forward to working with the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, I think to make the gentleman's point, none of them were closed, and none of the wartime supplementals came in the fashion that this one did today, and I am disappointed with that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is the gentleman's sense on when the work that was stopped in the middle, right before a vote yesterday on the D.C. bill, when will we see that again?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>As soon as possible.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Do you think we will see it next week?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I don't know that we will see it next week, although I would like to see it next week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman knows, I was very concerned and remain concerned about the interpretation of germaneness. And, frankly, that wouldn't have been a problem either had the minority been willing to offer the traditional motion, which was to recommit and have it immediately reported back to the floor. I will tell my friend we would have had a vote on that. I think you would have probably prevailed on the motion itself, and we would have prevailed on the bill. It would have carried that rider with  it, of course. But the minority, frankly, from our perspective, chose to try to defeat the bill by not just making the motion to recommit to adopt the proposition that you offered, but sending it back to committee for that purpose, which was obviously not necessary, which leads me to believe, I want to tell you honestly, my friend, that this was a procedural device to kill the bill rather than let it come to a vote on its merits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman knows, I feel very strongly personally, others do as well, but I feel very strongly personally that we ought to extend a full voting franchise to the Representative who sits on this floor and represents 600,000 of our fellow Americans. The answer to your question is, I hope to bring that to the floor as soon as possible under conditions where we will protect ourselves from procedurally losing a bill which has the majority of votes on this floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for that response. On the issue of merit, I suggest that the use of the procedural availability to the minority wouldn't be nearly as necessary if this bill is meritorious and has a majority of votes on the floor to actually have a debate where the bill is amendable, where there are substitutes available, where the other side of this debate has an opportunity to truly offer other ideas. And so far in this year we have not really seen an openness on any bill that was  a bill that didn't pass in the last Congress on suspension to competition of real ideas and debate. I think that is what we saw on that bill. That is one of the reasons that that is one of the few alternatives we had to push back a bill that was not adequately debated, that has significant constitutional questions. We look forward to the bill being on the floor again.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the views. Although, as the gentleman knows, that bill was reported out of the Government Reform Committee chaired by a Republican, with a Republican majority, with a majority of Republicans voting for the bill to report it out of the committee in the last session. So while I understand your view, it is not as if we were taking up a bill that hadn't already been processed by your committee in the last Congress, reported out of that committee, and because obviously there  is opposition to it on your side of the aisle, not brought to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the gentleman's point; but very frankly, the only reason it has not passed, because it has the majority of votes on this floor, was because the motion that was made was not the traditional motion of adopting a proposition, in this case the gun control issue, and reporting it immediately back out with that amendment attached.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate what the gentleman is saying, but I can't feel too guilty about bringing to the floor a bill that was reported out of a Republican-chaired committee with a Republican majority.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate my friend's sense of that. But I would also say that if this bill has such broad support and such unquestioned merit, there shouldn't be any fear in having a full and open debate where the bill is amendable, where alternatives can be proposed, and where the only opportunity to slow this process down would not be to take advantage of the only possible rule available to us under a rule that was otherwise closed. That is my view of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for his comments. We look forward to the budget debate next week.</paragraph>
