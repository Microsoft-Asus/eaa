  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I want to thank Chairman Kanjorski of the Capital Markets Subcommittee, as well as Chairman Frank, for working with us and allowing <bill type="h" number="5611">H.R. 5611</bill>, the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act, to be considered today. This is, indeed, an important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was pleased to introduce this bill, along with my good friend, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Davis), as insurance regulatory reform is an issue many involved agree requires action. It, indeed, has been a pleasure to work with Representative Davis on this, who is one of my distinguished colleagues on the Committee on Financial Services. We both believe that this bill is a good starting point for leveling the playing field for insurance agents and brokers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Never before, Mr. Speaker, have we really seen the significance and importance of the financial services industry as we are seeing it today. There are so many, many, many pieces that need to be reformed and looked at and improved upon, and this legislation happens to be one of those pieces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5611">H.R. 5611</bill> will simply establish the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers, which we refer to as NARAB, to provide for nonresident insurance agent and broker licensing while preserving the rights of States to supervise and discipline insurance agents and brokers. The legislation will further benefit consumers through increased competition among agents and brokers, leading to greater consumer choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is straightforward. Insurance agents and brokers who are licensed in good standing in their home States can apply for membership in the National Association for Registered Agents and Brokers, NARAB, which will allow them to operate in multiple States. This is very much needed. Membership will be voluntary and not affecting the rights of a nonmember producer under any State license, respecting the sanctity of the State. This legislation will benefit policyholders by increasing  marketplace competition and consumer choice by enabling insurance producers to more quickly and responsibly serve the needs of the consumer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A private, nonprofit NARAB entity consisting of State insurance regulators and marketplace representatives will serve as a portal for agents and brokers to obtain nonresident licenses in additional States. This is provided that they pay the required State nonlicensing fees and meet the NARAB standards for membership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would also establish membership criteria which would include standards for personal qualifications, education, training and experience; and further, member applicants must be required to undergo a national criminal background check. And, to be very clear, NARAB would not, I repeat, would not be part of nor report to any Federal agency and would not have any Federal regulatory power. This is being done to streamline and bring greater efficiency and greater choice to consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Federal legislation is needed to ensure a reciprocal licensing process for insurance agents and brokers, and Congress already endorsed this concept when we passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act would have created NARAB if a number of States had not reached a certain number of licensing reciprocity, and although enough reciprocity was provided to avoid the creation of NARAB, it has been brought to my attention and to Mr. Davis' attention by agents across  this country that there is a frustration over incomplete insurance licensing reciprocity, and this legislation addresses that important fact. It is abundantly clear that the bar was not set high enough in Gramm-Leach-Bliley, thus the reason behind this important legislation that we are considering today. We, my colleague, Mr. Davis and I, are simply working to ensure an updated version of NARAB.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the increased competition among agents and brokers this bill would create will be beneficial to all, and on all accounts, be more fair; and, in addition, lead to greater consumer choice. Mr. Speaker, this is what is important. The bottom line, it is the benefit to the consumer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As more and more agents operate across State lines, this problem of reciprocity has become worse, and it has become apparent to us that true nonresident licensing reform for insurance  agents could only really be achieved through legislation at the Federal level. That is why this Congress is acting today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NARAB Reform Act that we are looking at today has garnered support from both sides of the aisle, both Democrats and Republicans, with 48 bipartisan cosponsors, and 27 of these cosponsors are Members serving on the Financial Services Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I was very much pleased to work with the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Davis) on this legislation which again narrowly targets only the area where there is a problem. We have gone in with a laser beam and simply targeted where there is a problem to fix, and we have done that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our manager's amendment was recently endorsed by the NAIC, showing that the State insurance regulators believe that this type of legislation is badly needed reform. Other groups that support this bill include the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America, the IIABA; the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisers, the NAIFA; the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, the NAMIC; the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, PCI; and the Council of Insurance  Agents and Brokers, the CIAB; as well as a number of individual insurance companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As talks continue on this issue, we are very hopeful for the expansion of our regulatory board to include PIA, the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents. This has been a very inclusive process, Mr. Speaker, working in a very much needed area to bring a greater degree of consumer choice and benefits to the American consumer of insurance products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to have the opportunity again to work along with my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee and Mr. Davis on this important legislation. And to close, I would just simply urge all of my fellow Members to support <bill type="h" number="5611">H.R. 5611</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400633" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="5611">H.R. 5611</bill>, the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act, or NARAB II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I would like to commend my friend, DAVID SCOTT. We come from two different parties, but a common background in the business community, in the small business community, understanding the issues that business people deal with on a daily basis, and crossing multiple regulatory frameworks dealing with multiple States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My experience has led to my support and working to develop this bill and to get it passed tonight and hopefully signed into law before the end of year. It was based on my experience as a small business owner, not as an agent, but as a business owner who had employees in several different States, and suddenly found when I reached out to a good friend of mine who was an agent himself that he had to deal with several different agents. It suddenly became very complicated and very costly from a time  standpoint. It was inefficient and not cost effective at all for any of us to get these different plans to fit the needs and in compliance with each State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After I came to Congress, with that experience in the back of my mind, I also heard from many, many agents in the insurance industry, and many small business owners who encountered situations like I had sitting astride the nexus of three States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Insurance reform has been the subject of discussion for many years now. There are many different perspectives on it. What DAVID and I have tried to do through this bill, and our staffs, is to simply solve a process problem that allows people to work together more effectively. To me, this is the height of bipartisanism at its best. We are working to common cause, to fix a process that helps our citizens across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very pleased to see this meaningful and targeted reform measure make it to the floor today after over a year of work. NARAB II goes straight to the heart of the difficulties that insurance agents and brokers, and small business owners who are their customers, face on a daily basis as they try to navigate this web of State licensing requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act would have created the original NARAB system in the event that the States did not satisfy the producer licensing reform objectives outlined in the underlying bill. Ultimately, the States were perceived to have achieved a specified level of licensing reciprocity, and NARAB was never created. Thus, the problem remained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 10 years since the passage of Gramm-Leach-Bliley, we are still in need of progress on this issue. <bill type="h" number="5611">H.R. 5611</bill> mandates the creation of NARAB. The board's purposes and function will be generally the same as the provisions of Gramm-Leach-Bliley. In short, agents and brokers licensed in good standing in their home State and meeting NARAB-member criteria will be able to join NARAB. Members will pay the appropriate fees required by each State in which they are licensed, and so this will not eliminate  any revenue States currently generate from licensing. NARAB would not have any Federal regulatory authority, an important point that my friend from Georgia highlighted during his remarks as well. This is not an expansion of the Federal bureaucracy, it is a correction to allow the private sector to continue to grow business and create jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to think of NARAB as a stamp of approval for an insurance agent acknowledged and accepted nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the hard work, expertise and advice from all of the insurance industry groups in helping us to come to compromise on <bill type="h" number="5611">H.R. 5611</bill>. In particular, the NAIC has been an invaluable source of knowledge, and I appreciate their substantive suggestions for ways we can improve the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We made sure that the State insurance commissioners had a voice in the shaping of this legislation to ensure that State rights were protected, and at the same time we were able to address a direct issue that was affecting these brokers and small business customers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5611">H.R. 5611</bill> takes a significant step toward improving the way our insurance markets operate within the existing State-based system. I would like to thank in particular Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, Chairman Kanjorski, and Ranking Member Pryce for their leadership on the important issue of insurance reform and for their support of this bill that Mr. Scott and I introduced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I want to thank my good friend, DAVID SCOTT, for his work and also his staff, Michael Andel and Tammy McAthey, and my legislative director, Lauren O'Brien, who have worked long and hard to bring this to pass. This has been a great piece of legislation. I urge support for the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I just want to again echo my sentiments, and appreciate the fine work that Mr. Davis has done on this. It's been a pleasure working with him and the full committee and all of our staffs combined and working with the insurance industry itself and especially our agents to make their work smoother and to pass a bill that is very forward-looking to improve consumer benefits on their end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
