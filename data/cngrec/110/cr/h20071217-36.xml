    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on the resolution under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New Hampshire?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to first start out by thanking my distinguished colleague on the Armed Services Committee, Robin Hayes, for his work on this bill and his continued support for the Marine Corps. I would also like to thank Debra Wada and Joe Hicken from the committee staff for their work to bring this to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this year, the United States Marine Corps celebrated 232 years of devoted service. This year's celebration, like those of years before, commemorates generations of service to our country and reminds us of their commitment to our freedom and their selflessness. This is an enduring trait of their past, present and future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As soldiers, our marines have fought valiantly to protect democracy and human liberty when those essential freedoms were threatened around the world. In our most dire times, the Marine Corps stepped to the forefront in places like Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Guam. For those from that generation who are still with us, this resolution celebrates you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As peacekeepers, our marines have stood between rebels and refugees, providing safe haven and aid in the Balkans and to nations in Africa, South America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. To those brave marines, this resolution is for you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As preservists of democracy, marines have protected U.S. and foreign diplomats as they sought to restore peace and stability to war-torn nations. In places like Beirut, they often paid the ultimate price. This resolution is for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As liberators, Marines were the first conventional U.S. ground forces in Afghanistan, toppling the Taliban government that sheltered al Qaeda and were complicit in the attacks of September 11. Our Marine Corps has lost 40 men and women during Operation Enduring Freedom. This resolution honors them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As heroes, marines have earned the Medal of Honor 298 times, the Distinguished Service Cross 417 times, and the Navy Cross 2,168 times. But they don't do it for the medals or the ribbons. They do it for the people of the United States. To the more than 219,000 marines in the active duty and Reserves, this resolution is for you. Thank you for your service to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Carol Shea-Porter for introducing this resolution and my colleagues, led by Representative Robin Hayes, on the Armed Services Committee, for bringing it to the floor for our consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a proud co-sponsor, I am honored to have this opportunity to celebrate the United States Marine Corps and recognize their 232 years of service to our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On November 10, 1775, the Second Continental Congress passed a resolution that called for two battalions of  marines to be raised for use as naval infantrymen. From that day forward, marines have defended this Nation in every American military conflict. They first saw combat in the Bahamas in 1776 under the leadership of Captain Samuel Nicholas, the officer who is considered by most to be the first marine commandant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though the Marines were disbanded following the Revolutionary War, they were reestablished on July 11, 1798, and from that day forward have protected and defended Americans and our allies around the world. From Europe to the Philippines, South America to Asia, and the Middle East, marines have fought in every corner of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to traditional military duties, marines protect our embassies and dignitaries around the world. They have served in a humanitarian capacity bringing relief and aid to citizens of other nations as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the global war on terrorism, 76,000 marines have been deployed to Iraq to help establish peace, root out insurgent remnants and al Qaeda terrorists, and bring stability to that young democracy. I am grateful for my son, a naval doctor, who is working with the marines in Iraq today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As part of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, marines have helped topple the repressive Taliban regime and dismantle the al Qaeda network. For their service on these two fronts of the global war on terrorism, marines have been decorated with thousands of honors and medals. These decorations include 7,720 Purple Hearts for wounds suffered during combat, and 866 Bronze Stars with "V" for exceptional valor in a combat situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the inception of the United States Marine Corps, 298 marines have earned the Congressional Medal of Honor, our Nation's highest military honor. On a personal note, the Second District of South Carolina, which I have the honor of representing, is home to Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort and Parris Island. All marine recruits east of the Mississippi River go through Parris Island.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Marines are the most elite fighting force in our military. Their reputation for professionalism and selfless duty has earned them the thanks of a grateful Nation and the appreciation of millions around the world over two centuries of service and sacrifice. My late father-in-law, Major Julian Dusenbury, and my late brother-in-law, Captain Tim Dusenbury, were proud marines, and our family especially appreciates the service of the Marine Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of my colleagues in the House of Representatives and the American people, I want to thank the tireless men and women of the United States Marine Corps for their service and sacrifice. Each and every day they are working to protect our Nation and our allies around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage all my colleagues to join me in supporting and expressing our most humble appreciation for the few, the proud, the Marines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Having no further speakers, I would like to make one further statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity, 2 years ago, of visiting in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, where the Marine Corps ably served to assist the people of Pakistan in their recovery from the horrific incidents of the earthquake. And it was so reassuring to visit and see the hospital that they set up, with female doctors, due to the cultural concerns of the people in that region. It had just an extraordinary impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the privilege of meeting with President Musharraf, who indicated that at that time the most famous toy, the most appreciated toy, in all of Pakistan was the Chinook helicopter, representing the deep affection of the people of Pakistan for the Marine Corps and their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
