  <narrative>STEROIDS IN SPORTS -- (House of Representatives - February 26, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1033]</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the order of the House of January 4, 2007, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Stearns) is recognized during morning-hour debate for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400388" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, like many of my colleagues, I'm a big sports fan. I have had the opportunity to play sports in</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, the scourge of steroids and performance-enhancing drugs is not simply a footnote in the history of sports in America. Steroid use goes much deeper, to the basic integrity of sports and all of athletics. At the most fundamental level, steroid use is just plain cheating. And furthermore, it is illegal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Steroids are classified as a Schedule III controlled substance under the Controlled Subst ance Act. Those caught in illegal possession of steroids without a  prescription face arrest and prosecution. Dealers face a Federal felony charge and up to 5 years in prison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, steroid use involves significant health risks for all athletes who use them. Studies suggest that use of steroids can lead to stunted growth in adolescents, increased risk of heart and liver disease, as well as cancer and hormonal problems for both men and women. And that is why these and other factors demand th at our elite athletic organizations, both professional and amateur, establish uniform, world-class drug testing standards that are consistent and robust, just as our criminal</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the most worrisome development is that steroids are not only infiltrating their professional and elite amateur leagues, they are finding their way into middle schools and high school sports programs. In fact, according to the most recent Monitoring for the Future survey, funded by the National Institute on  Drug Abuse, 3 1/2  percent of high school seniors have used steroids with similar percentages for grades 8-10.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are alarming numbers that represent just a part of the susceptible youth population that is out there. These estimates suggest that the high school steroid problem is just as great, if not greater, than it is in the professional leagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As any parent knows, high school is a trying time for many kids, let alone student athletes. These exceptional kids now face yet another hazard all</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must take an aggressive stand against this plague before these pressures lead young student athletes to use steroids, its destructive effects on honesty and fair play and ultimately, their very health and well-being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And here and before the Commerce Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee last year, which I chaired in the last Congress, we heard testimony from a parent of a young man who tragical ly took his own life when that pressure to succeed, coupled with steroids, became too much. Unfortunately, these tragic stories are all too common.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Richard Pound, the founder and chair of the World Anti-Doping Agency says, "Do we want our children to be forced to become drug addicts in order to be successful in sports? Like it or not, sports stars are heroes and idols to our kids. Our kids copy their heroes' behavior. That's why we have to encourage the stars to be good role models both on and off the  field." Congress must continue to look into the use of illegal steroid and performance enhancing drug use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Professional leagues have an obligation to be the gold standard with regard to education, detection and sanctions for the illicit use of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. The recent scandals in baseball, the Olympics, professional wrestling and in other professional amateur sports have served to highlight the significance of the steroids problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, sometimes I'm asked back in  the district why I care about drugs in sports. Shouldn't the athletes perhaps do whatever they want? They are only hurting themselves, is the reply. The use of steroids and performance-enhancing drugs by athletes today goes beyond just the integrity of the sport. By using illegal drugs, athletes are, in effect, telling our children that the only way to be successful and compete at the highest level is to cheat. That is not the message I want our children to hear.</paragraph>
