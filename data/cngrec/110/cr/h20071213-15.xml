  <speaking speaker="400657" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the fiscal responsibility and accountability that PAYGO affords us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PAYGO requires that increases in spending or tax cuts be offset and enables us to make the right choices with our Nation's revenue. It is a simple but tough rule that helped us lower the national deficit and balance the budget in the 1990s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm glad that we are now working to pass legislation under PAYGO to ensure that the national deficit is not increased and that enables us to have the revenue on hand that we need to address the very important needs of our Nation. I am proud to support the kind of fiscal discipline that PAYGO has given us, and I hope to see that every piece of legislation continues with this PAYGO regulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I continue to support fiscal responsibility under PAYGO for the House of Representatives to ensure that future generations are not mortgaged any further with irresponsible spending.</paragraph>
