    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as President Bush allows the war in Iraq to drag on, with no change in policy and no end in sight, it is important that we hear what our combat soldiers are saying on the front lines of that war. Over the weekend, The Washington Post published a story on the First Infantry Division of the First Battalion, which has been patrolling the streets of Baghdad for the last 14 months. Those troops are tired, bitter and skeptical. One such soldier told the reporter,  and I am quoting, "I don't think this place is worth another soldiers' life."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our soldiers are also frustrated that decisionmakers here in Washington don't fully realize what is going on. Quoting another soldier: "They just know back there what the higher-ups tell them. But the higher-ups don't go anywhere, and actually they only go to the safe places with a little bit of gunfire. They don't see what we see on the ground." Having been to Iraq a number of times, as many of my colleagues have, how true that is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, none of us in this Chamber can imagine what our soldiers go through on a daily basis in Iraq, but the White House needs to start listening to them. It is well past time to bring our sons and daughters home from this fiasco we call the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
