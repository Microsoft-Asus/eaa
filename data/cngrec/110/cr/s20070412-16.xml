  <narrative>The legislative clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory live quorum be waived and the cloture vote occur on Monday, April 16, at 5:30 p.m.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate resume consideration of the bill on Monday at 3 p.m. and that Senator Rockefeller be recognized at that time to offer a managers' amendment on behalf of himself and Senator Bond.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, earlier today the Senate invoked cloture on the motion to proceed to the fiscal year 2007 Intelligence authorization bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, as a result of objections from the other side, the Senate now finds itself in the unfortunate position of having to run out the clock for the next several days rather than promptly considering and completing action on this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me remind my colleagues of the long road we have been down with this bill already.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The previous Republican-controlled Congress failed to pass an intelligence authorization bill in fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2007--2 years in a row.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is an unprecedented and unacceptable record for this body: prior to that, Congress had passed this bill every single year for 27 years, often with the bipartisan support of every Senator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues know, the Intelligence authorization bill funds the operations of the 16 agencies of the U.S. intelligence community--including the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the Defense Department--and all the critical work they do to keep Americans safe and fight the war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It includes essential initiatives that would improve our efforts to fight terrorism and control weapons of mass destruction, enhance our intelligence collection capabilities, and strengthen intelligence oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Blocking the passage of this bill, as a handful of Senators on the other side of the aisle have done over the last couple of years, has left Congress silent on these important matters and made America less secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of us in the Senate recognize how important it is to pass this bill. We know it is not a partisan issue, that there are no political points to be scored on either side. But I am increasingly disappointed at the continued obstructionism by several Republicans on a matter of national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, Chairman Rockefeller and Vice Chairman Bond attempted to bring this bill up for consideration. We were told the objections of a single Senator on the other side of the aisle blocked their efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard that some Senators on the other side of the aisle are interested in offering amendments, yet at this time none of these amendments have surfaced or seen the light of day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would certainly like to be reasonable and accommodate every Senator's interest in debating amendments offered in good faith, but I am increasingly concerned that we are seeing obstructionism and delay tactics, rather than productive debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some may wonder what is behind the delay. At a time of war, why would a handful of Senators be willing to hold up a bill that is crucial to our national security?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why would a group of Senators hold up a bill that has always passed quickly, with little debate or amendment?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why would they hold up a bill that enjoys overwhelming bipartisan support?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It appears the answer lies not in the legislation before us now but the legislation the Senate will turn to next:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Medicare bill that will lower drug costs for seniors and people with disabilities by giving the Federal Government the power to negotiate drug prices with some of this Nation's most powerful and profitable companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not good faith debate--it is a cynical effort by the drug companies--their lobbyists in Gucci shoes and chauffeured limousines--and their supporters--to hold this national security bill hostage and delay the Senate from acting on legislation to help society's most vulnerable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I ask my colleagues to consider this fair notice: unless I see some signs of good faith from the other side of the aisle toward a reasonable timeframe for considering a reasonable number of amendments, I will file cloture on this bill tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate has a lot of work ahead of it and it should begin with the swift consideration and passage of this bill.</paragraph>
