  <narrative>PAYING THE PRICE FOR THE PRESIDENT'S FLAWED PRIORITIES -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H597]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Bishop) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400031" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, at least President Bush is consistent. Like the other seven budgets that he has submitted to this Congress, it is no surprise that his eighth and final request continues to reflect spectacularly flawed priorities. There was some debate earlier this week about whether the budget should be printed and distributed to congressional offices. Perhaps the best decision would have been to spare us the books and save the trees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the eighth year in a row, the administration has degraded the budget process. This budget barely goes through the motions. Instead of formulating a blueprint to guide this Nation toward what should be our fiscal priorities, the budget continues the flawed policies of the past 7 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without putting forth an honest or straightforward budget, the President has yet to attempt seriously to meet our goals, goals that we should all share of budgetary accountability, enforcement, and fiscal responsibility. This is why so many of our colleagues, Madam Speaker, have already accurately described the President's budget request has a pro forma document with little meaning or relevance, that has also been described as arriving on Capitol Hill "dead on arrival," and that is perhaps  a very, very good thing. Perhaps the lack of truth in budgeting represents the best example of why "change" has become the overriding theme of this coming election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress should refuse to be misled again by a budget that hides the true costs of the devastating fiscal policies of this administration. For example, omitting total war costs gives an artificially deflated notion of what the deficit will be, and we now have the Secretary of Defense estimating that the true cost of the war in fiscal 2009 will be $170 billion, as opposed to the $70 billion that is put in the budget as a placeholder. That number alone will drive the deficit up to over half  a trillion dollars. The President's budget also omits the cost of extending the tax cuts, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, which disproportionately favor those who need those tax cuts the least.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just cite two very troubling aspects of a budget that is shot through with scores of troubling aspects. The first is one that is of particular importance to my home State of New York. We have been fighting, those of us in New York, and this fight has been led primarily by CAROLYN MALONEY and also VITO FOSSELLA and JERRY NADLER, to see to it that the brave Americans who responded to the site of the World Trade Center, first to try to rescue people, then to recover bodies  and then to clean up what came to be known as "the pile," some 70 percent of them are suffering from various health ailments relating to the toxins that they were exposed to in the days immediately following those attacks on the Twin Towers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the current year, the Congress committed to spend $150 million to provide for the ongoing health care needs and monitoring of those very brave first responders and rescue workers. The President's budget cuts that number to $25 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My question for the President is: Have all of these people all of a sudden become well? Have they been miraculously cured? Or, more likely, has the President simply decided that providing health care for these very brave Americans is simply not a Federal responsibility? In either case, I certainly hope that this Congress will do the right thing and restore that funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second has to do with education, particularly access to higher education. In his State of the Union message, the President chided the Congress for not having fully funded his American Competitiveness Initiative. Yet we are now presented with a budget that eliminates two programs for student financial aid that are absolutely crucial for needed students to attend college. One is called Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, approximately $750 million a year, and the other is Perkins loans,  approximately $670 million a year. For those two programs, the President advocates taking approximately $1.4 billion out of the student loan program, and does so while costs are rising and the ability of students to pay is declining.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How can we have a competitive workforce, how can we have a competitive Nation, if we don't even provide our young men and women with access to college?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Future generations of Americans will pay the price for the President's flawed priorities and more debt as a consequence of his actions. In fact, the debt that will be accrued over the 8 years of the Bush Presidency will amount to some $3.5 trillion. That is an amount that exceeds the combined debt of all of the Presidents from George Washington through the first President Bush.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues, I implore my colleagues, to resolve one last time to defeat this budget request from the President and to restore middle-class, mainstream priorities, the very priorities that our new majority has been working on now for the last year.</paragraph>
