  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to speak on my amendment. I do have an amendment to the Transportation bill that I would like to talk about for a few minutes this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have listened to a lot of the debate this week. Obviously, transportation is a key issue for this country, and it has become clear that because of the tragedy in Minnesota, many of us are concerned about bridges and those that are deficient. We have talked a lot about how to fund those, and I am afraid, as Congress often does, we ignore a serious problem until it is too late, and then we decide we want to throw a lot of money at it and we come riding in on white horses to fix the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we do need to look at the problem and what we can do at the Federal level, and I have an amendment that I think will make the dollars we spend go a lot further that I would like to present to Members this morning. But, first, I think we need to review a little of the situation we are in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we have all heard in the debate that America has many bridges we have deemed structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. My amendment addresses these particular bridges. There are over 150,000 bridges in the country today--or over 20 percent of our total bridges--that fall under the classification of structurally deficient and functionally obsolete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every day in this country, right now, people are going to work and filling up their gas tanks. Over 18 cents of every gallon they put in their tanks is a Federal tax that comes to us. That tax was actually started many years ago when we wanted to build the Interstate Highway System in this country. It started at a much lower level. I think most of us know the Interstate Highway System is basically complete. Yet we have continued to take that tax and raise it over the years. So what we are doing  is taking money from the States and bringing it to Washington. The problem is that very little of that actually gets back for the maintenance of bridges in our States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To start off with, a lot of States, the majority of States in this country, don't get back what they send. We call them donor States. South Carolina is one of the donor States. We will send our tax to Washington and, for years, we have gotten back less than 90 cents on a dollar. This clearly hurts our State. But what does come back comes back with a lot of red tape and regulations that prevent the dollars from going as far as they could.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What has happened in South Carolina and many other States is that in order to get those Federal dollars back, we have had to match them with our State dollars. For years, we have taken money out of our maintenance funds for roads and bridges and used it to match the Federal dollars. But the Federal dollars have to be used in particular ways that are not necessarily for the maintenance of roads and bridges. Even more important are all of the earmarks we put in the Transportation bill, earmarks  for bridges to nowhere or a Big Dig in Boston, and these earmarks usually have to be matched at a higher level to get those dollars, and they have to then be used in the way the earmark prescribes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have looked through a lot of past bills and found very few earmarks that are to maintain and improve bridges. They are for new projects and things on which we can do press releases. But the bottom line is this: Less than 40 cents on a dollar that we send to Washington actually ends up helping to maintain roads and bridges. That is a problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there are a lot of things we can do, and I have identified one I would like us to focus on today. It is the old law called the Davis-Bacon provision. It actually started during the Depression, when many companies were hungry to get business, and so they sharpened their pencils and gave lower bids to cities, and the larger companies didn't like that. So they created the Davis-Bacon law, which actually allows the Federal Government to set the wages of companies when they are doing Federal  work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What happens in most parts of the country, such as South Carolina, when a small company--perhaps a minority-owned company--may be trying to compete with a large company, they will come in with a lower bid, but then they have to allow the Federal Government to set the wages. We call it prevailing wages, but it may not be the prevailing wage in South Carolina. The American Association of Builders and Contractors has estimated that the Davis-Bacon provision raises the cost of construction from 5  percent to 38 percent. Just think of that. Think of that money and how it could be multiplied if that provision was not part of the equation for maintaining and getting these obsolete and structurally deficient bridges in better order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what this amendment is about. It is not an unprecedented idea. President Bush realized during Katrina that we had to do a lot of work and get a lot of firms in action--small firms. All these firms have already worked  out the salaries with their employees. Some may be revenue sharing and not related to salary. But as long as Davis-Bacon is in order, those firms have to wait for the Federal Government to tell them what to pay their employees so they can then bid a job. It slows the whole process. So during Katrina, the President waived it, and during Hurricane Andrew, after that we waived the Davis-Bacon provision so that the money could go further and the rebuilding could take place quicker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is very simple in that it focuses particularly on bridges that have already been designated structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. For 1 year only, we waive this Davis-Bacon provision so that the States and municipalities around this country can take the Federal money that is provided and make it go further to fix these bridges--to build new ones in some cases--and to allow them to move quicker and not wait for some Federal bureaucrat to tell them what to pay their employees  in order to get a job from the city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Anyone in business, particularly in the construction-related business, knows that it sometimes is feast or famine; you either have too much work or you don't have any. Many times, a municipal government or State government can get a lot lower bid and get work done much quicker if they are allowed to take those low bids. Unfortunately, the way we have it set up with Davis-Bacon, we force such a bureaucracy, we force these particular salaries on these companies that may have different arrangements  with their employees, and it slows the whole process. Just think--we are talking about a 38-percent increase in cost, in some cases, just because of Davis-Bacon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would encourage my colleagues to consider this amendment. We are not talking about getting rid of Davis-Bacon forever, although I think that is something we should perhaps consider. But this is just a 1-year waiving of Davis-Bacon specifically for the repair and maintenance of structurally deficient and functionally obsolete bridges. If we do this, I think the public will get a lot more for their tax dollars, we will get this work done a lot quicker, and it makes a whole lot more sense than  raising the Federal gas tax. That is kind of the way Congress does things--we have a problem, so let's just raise taxes and spend more money. In this case, we have about $4 for every $10 we spend that doesn't go to what we say it does. If we can do a few things, like waive Davis-Bacon, the money we take from the public can go a whole lot further.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage Members to vote for this amendment this morning. I hope the majority will not table it, because we have seen in Katrina and other tragedies that our money goes a lot further, the work gets done faster, and our goals as a Congress are met a lot sooner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the chairwoman for the time, and I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for giving me an opportunity to make a response to the Senator from South Carolina on this issue of prevailing wage that guides the wage for Federal construction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This idea and concept goes back to the 1930s--1931. What is the prevailing wage? It is effectively the local average wage. Why was this decided, that we are going to have the average wage? Because it was decided then, with a Republican Congress, a Republican Congress and Republican President, that we do not want the Federal Government interfering with what is happening in local community wages. If they are going to be less in South Carolina than they are in Massachusetts, they ought to use the  local prevailing wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is this complicated? No, it is not complicated at all. All you have to do is go look on the Web and find out what the prevailing wage is in South Carolina and what it is in Boston, MA. This was the basic concept.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What has been the result of having the prevailing wage? The prevailing wage gives assurances to families. The Federal highway system was such an extraordinary national system developed and proposed by President Eisenhower. It has meant all the difference to the American economy. What the Davis-Bacon program is saying is we are going to pay the average wage to workers under the Davis-Bacon program, but those individuals who are going in those programs, by and large, almost all of them, have gone  through various apprenticeship programs and are skilled workers. That is why the University of Utah study of nine southwestern and mountain States has pointed out that the cost of using Davis-Bacon was actually cheaper, less costly to the taxpayer than it would have been if they had not had prevailing wages. An analysis of Federal Highway Administration data in 2004 reached a similar conclusion--that states paying higher wages had lower highway construction costs and higher labor productivity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want to make sure that when we have our highways and bridges, they are going to be safe and they are going to be secure and they are going to be made by those individuals who have the skills to do the job and do it right and do it well and do it for the protection of American families, whether it is the workers who drive in to work or the children who come back in the various buses from schools all over the community. That is what we are talking about--skilled work, competent work, on-time  work done by people who have training and follow a very important tradition. These people are out there working night and day; in the cold of the winter working out there at night, and in the day in the heat of the summer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is the average wage we are talking about in this whole debate? The median construction wage in this country is $35,000. Does that seem so outrageous, for someone who has a skill, $35,000? Are we going to try to say with all of the challenges and problems we have in our transportation system, this $35,000 is so much we want to try to reduce those wages for working men and women in this country? Is this so outrageous, with the challenges we have seen, in terms of what people are being paid  in the United States of America today? Of course not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very dangerous industry. More men and women are killed in construction than in any other industry. Do you hear me? More men and women are killed in construction than in any other industry. Three times more men and women are killed in construction than the national average for other industries, and for some of those who are building bridges, it's even more dangerous. The fatality rate for structural iron and steel workers is 13 times more than the average industry. These are high-risk  jobs and we are talking about paying people $35,000 a year? In terms of the important issues we are facing, it makes no sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want to make sure that when the Federal taxpayer dollar is expended, it is going to get quality work, it is going to get productivity, it is going to get results, it is going to have accountability. That is what Davis-Bacon has provided over the period of years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator has 5 1/2  minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>To show what the difference is in terms of prevailing wages for local workers, for ironworkers in Greene, AL, the prevailing wage is $13.67 per hour. An ironworker in Greene, AL makes $21,872 a year. For ironworkers in Denver, CO, the prevailing wage is $22.50, annually $36,000. In Des Moines, ironworkers make $20.60 an hour; $32,960 per year. The average wage in El Paso is $12.03 an hour; they make $19,248, $19,248 a year. Are we trying to say in Texas, in El Paso, we are going  to try to undermine individual workers who are making $19,000? By and large most of them are skilled workers who have had apprenticeship programs. Is this the greatest challenge we are facing in our transportation system? No, it is not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The list goes on. This chart here shows construction is one of the most dangerous industries, with over 1,100 fatalities and over 410,000 work-related injuries. This is a dangerous industry and that is why it is so important we have programs, apprenticeship programs to teach these workers their skills but also teach them safety and security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regarding the injuries, prevailing wage laws lower construction injuries by 10 to 20 percent. If you have prevailing wages, if they are put into place, the number of individuals who are going to be involved in injuries, death, and serious injuries is actually reduced. Why? Because these workers have skills and have better training. More injuries mean higher workers' compensation costs. Without the Federal prevailing wage, workers would suffer up to 76,000 additional injuries leading to 675,000  more</paragraph>
    <paragraph>lost workdays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This hasn't been an issue that has been a partisan issue. When this was passed in 1931, author James Davis was a Republican Senator and Robert Bacon, another author, was a Republican from the House of Representatives. It was a Republican House majority that passed it. The Republican Senate passed the bill, and Republican President Herbert Hoover signed the bill into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very simple. This is necessary because of the importance of having high-skilled work being done on the bridges and roads of this country. The American taxpayer's dollar is a scarce dollar. We ought to make sure it is not  going to be used by fly-by-night operations. We want to make sure those people who are going to receive it are going to have the skills and training to make sure the roads and bridges are going to be safe and secure. That is what  Davis-Bacon does. It takes into consideration what the local wages are. Prevailing wages are published on the Internet. It is easy for any of the construction companies to understand it. They all understand it. We don't get complaints that they don't understand it. It is just in many instances they would rather get fly-by-night operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you look at the various studies that have been done, time in and time out, about prevailing wages, whether it is from the University of Utah--not a flaming liberal kind of university--looking at the western States, when they had the prevailing wage versus not having the prevailing wage, they show that using the prevailing wage actually resulted in the savings of taxpayer resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope this amendment will not be accepted. We have a tried and true system. We are talking about people, as I mentioned earlier, whose median income is $35,000. It is not excessive. It is difficult to make a good living today, $35,000 today, when you look at the cost of health care, the cost of tuition, the cost of the gasoline, the cost of heating oil--if you live in our part of the country, $35,000 doesn't go a long way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It does seem we want to make sure American taxpayers are going to get what their hard-earned taxes have been collected for and make sure they are going to be expended for skilled work. Davis-Bacon gives that assurance to working families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see the Senator from Washington. I don't know how much time I have, but I yield the remaining time to her.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the debate. I think it is important to have. Davis-Bacon does not make sites safer. It does not have anything to do with skilled workers. What it does is forces particularly small companies to revamp how they bid projects, to change how they pay their people. The cost of that administration as well as waiting for the Federal Government--you can't just go to the Internet. The Federal Government is going to have to approve what the prevailing wage is. It has been  deemed not functional, what is taking place. What we are talking about is not a suspension of Davis-Bacon forever, but a recognition in the next years we want a lot more dollars to be applied to bridge maintenance, and by waiving Davis-Bacon for 1 year our dollars will go further and the work will be done quicker.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, over the last 3 months a majority of project-based section 8 housing had payment disruptions with HUD not making timely payments under its contractual obligations to the owners of the housing facilities. As of the end of August, 50 facilities had not received payments just in my State of Iowa. The payments not received cover 2,466 apartments. Twenty-two percent of those projects were designated as "family projects," and 78 percent are elderly or disabled projects  or a combination of the two. Some of those facilities were still waiting for their June and July payments when the August payments failed to arrive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As of yesterday, I understand that about 20 projects in Iowa which have reached their contract expiration date at the end of June, July, or August still have not seen the routine work to renew the contracts, and payments have not been received in Iowa. I expect that Iowa is typical of the Nation in this regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The failure to make timely payments not only results in added costs to owners, it creates a chill on future investments in low-income housing. With that chill, I fear that the number of low-income housing units available to families and the elderly in need will be reduced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge that the committee work to provide for methods and requirements as well as financial resources so HUD will provide proper timely payments to all project-based section 8 projects in the coming fiscal year. I am particularly concerned with the situation that may occur if the Congress passes one or more short-term continuing resolutions for the beginning of the fiscal year. I would like to work with Chairman MURRAY and Senator BOND to accomplish these goals.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300076" topic="SECTION 8 HOUSING PAYMENTS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I agree that we have seen serious disruptions in payments to project-based section 8 facilities in recent months. That has caused real difficulties for many owners. I do believe that HUD needs to have processes in place that will make funding to project owners in as timely manner as possible. We also need to have funding in place where HUD can make its payments. I appreciate the Senators' interest in this area, and we will work to avoid a repeat of what we have seen  over the past 3 months.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300010" topic="SECTION 8 HOUSING PAYMENTS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I raised this issue on the Senate floor on Monday. I certainly believe this is a real difficulty, and I certainly believe HUD needs to meet its contractual obligations. I also agree that we need to create provisions that will assure that HUD makes its housing assistance payments on time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412243" topic="SECTION 8 HOUSING PAYMENTS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, earlier today I voted on a motion to table an amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma to remove three earmarks from the Transportation Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill. Those projects totaled $1.35 million and were for economic development efforts in North Dakota, Montana, and Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was a difficult decision for me. I believe that the earmarking process in the past decade has ballooned out of control at a cost of billions of dollars to taxpayers. I don't believe that all earmarks, per se, are bad, but that as a general policy, we need more transparency in this process, and I believe that competitive and formula grants are a better way to assure that taxpayer dollars are spent appropriately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I am uncomfortable with cherry-picking which earmarks are worthy and which ones are wasteful. There were dozens and dozens of earmarks totaling tens of millions of dollars in this bill. Why pick on just three?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, however, did support an amendment to take money designated for all of the earmarked transportation projects in this bill and transfer it to fund national urgent priorities such as emergency bridge repairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This will be a long process to cut down, and even eliminate, many congressional earmarks and other kinds of Government waste. Frankly, earmarks are just the easiest and most obvious target. Billions of dollars are spent every year by the Federal Government on no-bid contracts, for example. And we are nowhere near preventing this wasteful pattern of spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But progress is being made on the earmark front. Congress passed a comprehensive ethics bill that provides more transparency in the earmark process. Due to pressure from the American public demanding change, we have seen fewer earmarks in this year's appropriations bill. According to the administration's Office of Management and Budget, this very Transportation-HUD bill contains half the amount of earmarks compared to its last version from 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, there is still much work to be done, and as a fiscal conservative and former auditor, I will continue my efforts to fight to change the way the Federal Government does business with taxpayers' dollars--whether it is Congress or the administration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300087" topic="SECTION 8 HOUSING PAYMENTS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak about two important issues addressed in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. President, and I would like to thank Senators Murray  and Bond for their leadership on this bill. This bill will make America safer and stronger by improving our transportation and housing infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I would like to discuss the need for FAA modernization. My amendment would convey the sense of the Senate on the issue of FAA modernization. For too long, the FAA has been derelict in its duty on this important aspect of public safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Something is wrong when the thousands of everyday Americans with GPS devices in their cars are working off what appear to be more modern navigation systems than the FAA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment makes clear that this delay in implementing a modern air traffic control system threatens both the safety of our air passengers and the economy by delaying thousands of business and recreational passengers each day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment makes clear that the FAA must act now and fully implement the modernization system using the resources allocated in this bill to keep our skies safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee took a significant step forward in this bill by providing hundreds of millions of dollars for modernization. I thank them for their commitment to this issue, and now it is time for the FAA to step up to the plate and do their share.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should urge the FAA to move as quickly as possible in implementing the modernization system to finally put an end to the endless delays and dangerous near misses on our Nation's runways and in our skies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next, I would like to discuss the subprime crisis in the Senate about the need to assist the many families facing foreclosure as their subprime loans reset to unaffordable levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been studying this issue for some time. The mortgage industry has become the Wild West, and far too many homeowners have gotten caught up in the teaser-rate promises of subprime mortgages only to be devastated when they reset to higher, unaffordable levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have concluded that one of the best tools we have in helping to avoid this upcoming wave of foreclosures is the efforts of nonprofit organizations specializing in foreclosure avoidance and homeowner counseling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would like to thank Senators Murray and Bond for responding to my request for additional resources by allocating $100 million for those nonprofits to assist homeowners who are facing foreclosures. An estimated 2 million mortgages are scheduled to reset to higher interest rates in the next 12 months. This will mean a devastatingly high number of foreclosures, unless major action is taken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But because there are so many distressed homeowners right now, the nonprofits are overwhelmed. Some have already received more calls for help this year than they did all of last year, and things are likely to get worse before they get better. The non-profits simply do not have the resources to deal with this crisis. The home mortgage market is in a state of emergency, and these nonprofits are our best-equipped first responders. We ought to lend them a hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This investment will pay for itself many times over, through the avoidance of foreclosures and the pain and suffering they cost this country, both in economic and noneconomic terms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But government alone cannot solve this problem. It will require a major commitment by others as well, particularly those banks and mortgage servicers which have the ability, through loan modifications and refinancings, to help homeowners avoid foreclosures. These lenders and servicers made plenty of money while the housing markets were good, and I believe it is time for them to pitch in to help avoid the consequences of their actions, which contributed to this current crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why I have asked the country's major mortgage lenders and mortgage servicers to increase their efforts to help subprime borrowers avoid foreclosure. I have also asked them to also provide monetary commitments to the nonprofits, which everyone acknowledges are key to solving this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the millions of Americans at risk of losing their homes, these nonprofits can provide shelter from the foreclosure storm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a bipartisan solution to a bipartisan problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am encouraged that my colleague, Senator Bond, agrees that we need more resources devoted to this problem. I agree that $100 million more dollars is a good thing. I am concerned, however, that the conditions put on this money may restrict its most beneficial uses. I want to be sure that all the funds we dedicate are used to help keep every family possible in their homes, and I look forward to continuing to work with the committee to ensure that the funds in this amendment can do just  that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This subprime crisis is a danger to the housing market and the market as a whole, and efforts and resources at all levels of government and in the private sector should be devoted to alleviating this ongoing problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would like to applaud my friend and colleague, Senator Murray, whose leadership and determination were instrumental in getting $1 billion of additional funding for bridge replacement and rehabilitation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment addresses what we have known for far too long--we have been neglecting our infrastructure for far too long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The disaster in Minnesota was a wake-up call to get our Nation's transportation infrastructure in order. For far too long, highways and bridges in New York and across the country have been allowed to degrade to the point of dangerous disrepair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have said before after similar disasters, we must learn from them and fix the problems that caused them. We can no longer afford to neglect our aging highways and bridges in older cities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment goes a long way in learning from this disaster and fixing serious problems in our Nation's infrastructure. I commend Senator Murray for her leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment and look forward to working with Senator Murray on further projects in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with the committee on my amendments and to finishing this bill which represents, for the first time in a long time, the resources our country needs to support its infrastructure, transportation and housing positions.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(At the request of Mr. REID, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300022" topic="SECTION 8 HOUSING PAYMENTS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this Transportation/HUD appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008 crafted under the leadership of Chairman PATTY MURRAY makes key investments in our Nation's highway systems, aviation system, passenger rail, and provides housing services for those in need, the elderly and our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation allocates over $100 billion for the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, and for Housing and Urban Development. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, for every $1 billion that is spent on transportation, 47,500 jobs are created. In this legislation over $40 billion is invested in our Nation's highway system for construction of new roads, repairs and improvements. This legislation will create tens of thousands of new jobs, improve  safety to our highways and bridges--and will go a long ways to strengthen and grow our Nation's economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that my Senate colleagues voted to include $1 billion in Federal funding to aid in the repair and maintenance of America's bridges, which would include an additional $100 million for New York State's aging bridges. The bridge collapse in Minnesota is a sober reminder of the tragic results that can occur when our infrastructure needs are not met. New York State has more than 17,000 highway bridges, with 12 percent classified as structurally deficient, and 26 percent classified as functionally  obsolete and this additional funding is vital to my State of New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several Republicans sought to pass an amendment that would have repealed Davis-Bacon protections for construction workers involved in bridge reconstruction on structurally deficient bridges--an act that puts both our workers and our Nation at risk. I was disappointed by this attempt to undermine our workers' safety, and heartened that the bill does not contain this amendment. The tragic collapse of a major highway bridge in Minneapolis this year illustrates just  how  critical it is for our roads and bridges to be constructed with the safest and highest quality workmanship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Year after year the administration has attempted to bankrupt Amtrak. And again, I am proud that the Senate has rejected the President's proposal that would have pushed Amtrak into bankruptcy. Amtrak plays a vital role in our Nation's transportation system, especially for New Yorkers and those along the Northeast corridor. In an era of record gas prices, congested highways, and record delays and congestion for the flying public, the role of Amtrak has become more important and it must receive  the necessary funding to continue services and improve railway infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also contains vital funding for the Federal Aviation Administration, including much needed funding to pay for infrastructure needs at airports throughout New York, as well as funding for new technology to reduce delays and congestion at our Nation's airports. This summer, the flying public has seen record delays at our airports and it is imperative that we resolve this problem as soon as possible. I am proud that the Senate unanimously confirmed my bipartisan amendment requiring  the Department of Transportation to develop a plan how the FAA will alleviate congestion and delays in the New York/New Jersey/Philadelphia airspace by next summer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the funding for Transportation, this legislation provides desperately needed funds for more affordable housing and would provide housing for our homeless veterans, the elderly, and those in need. This legislation provides over $2 billion more than the President's request for programs under Housing and Urban Development. The legislation rejects the Bush administration's cuts to housing for the low-income elderly, as well as the administration's plan to eliminate Hope VI, a program  that revitalizes neighborhoods by replacing outdated public housing in disrepair with new mixed-income housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We still have work to do to improve our transportation systems. Airport delays in just a few years will cost our economy more than $30 billion every year and nationwide, poor road conditions and traffic congestion cost American drivers more than $110 billion each year in wasted fuel and lost time. There is a more than $1.6 trillion long-term infrastructure gap to fill--as a nation--we need to invest in our future again. I urge the President to remove his veto threat and sign this legislation  into law as quickly as possible so that these needed funds can be used to improve our Nation's aging infrastructure as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300071" topic="SECTION 8 HOUSING PAYMENTS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the bill before us is a budget buster. It is over $3 billion above the President's budget request and contains numerous earmarked projects, worth over $2 billion. It should be soundly rejected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Funding for transportation infrastructure and transportation safety is of enormous importance and I know all of us support doing what we can to improve our Nation's transportation system, from our roads and bridges to our air service. The tragic bridge collapse in Minnesota in August was a harsh reminder of just how critical our responsibilities are to balance competing transportation funding needs. But we simply must do so in a fiscally responsible manner. The Senate's action Monday to increase  the obligation limitation for the highway trust fund by $1 billion is not the answer nor was it responsible. It might have been politically expedient, but it is not the answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot afford to simply spend more and more of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars without consequences. It is time for Congress to start making choices among competing priorities, just as American families do each month with their family budgets. In this bill, we are not underfunding transportation; we are misdirecting infrastructure funding to earmarked projects that are questionable and certainly not urgently needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Reason Foundation's 16th Annual Highway Performance Report, 24 percent of our Nation's bridges were deficient or obsolete in 2005. Minnesota actually ranked 5th best in the Nation, yet we watched with horror as one of the State's major thoroughfares crumbled from disrepair. The Wall Street Journal reported on August 22, 2007, that a week before the bridge collapse, a Congressman from Minnesota inserted over $10 million in earmarks for rail transit, bike trails and the "Kids  Peace Mesabi Academy," but not a penny for bridge or infrastructure repair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to our aging bridges, our Interstate Highway System is over 50 years old and not equipped to handle today's traffic levels. So what has Congress done in response to this reality? We have increased earmarking of our highway program funding by a staggering level: The 1982 highway bill included 10 demonstration projects totaling $386 million; the 1987 highway bill included 152 demonstration projects totaling $1.4 billion; the 1991 highway bill included 538 location-specific projects  totaling $6.1 billion; the 1998 highway bill included 1,850 earmarked projects totaling $9.3 billion; and the 2005 highway bill included over 5,634 earmarked projects totaling $21.6 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So instead of allowing states the ability to allocate their highway dollars to their most pressing needs, like deficient bridges, we are funding a significantly higher level of bike paths and highway beautification projects and sidewalk improvements. When will we learn? When will we learn that this is not what the American people want or deserve from their elected representatives. How many more infrastructure tragedies will occur before we change our earmarking ways?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of raising the gas taxes, as some Members of Congress have suggested, for the millions of Americans who are already paying more for gas than ever before, the Federal and State governments must prioritize transportation spending to focus on projects with the most need rather than building "bridges to nowhere." If Congress fails to recover from its addiction to earmarks, then crumbling bridges, congested highways, and crowded airports will continue much to the determent of all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress recently passed an ethics reform bill that requires the disclosure of the authorship of earmarks. Ninety-one Members of this body requested transportation earmarks in this appropriations bill. For example, this bill contains $4 million for a bridge in Arkansas that does not appear in the Arkansas State transportation improvement plan, thereby questioning its necessity. The bill also includes almost $2 million for a study on the effects of dust suppressant chemicals on Federal highways,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, the bill includes a wide range of transportation earmarks. The bill also contains $8 million for airport improvements to Cape Cod and Nantucket, $2.5 million for improvements at the Niagara Falls International Airport, and $1.5 million for improvements at the airport in Palm Springs, CA. No doubt these popular tourist destinations could have helped to pay for these improvements themselves rather then requiring all taxpayers to subsidize such marvelous destinations that many taxpayers  may never be able to afford to visit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also provides $3.5 million to construct an airport in Akutan, AK--population 767--when an alternative airport is less than 55 miles away and $1 million for airport improvements at Lewis University, IL, for its 1,000 students. There are also earmarks for ferry service, such as $1 million for Nassau County, NY, which is the sixth richest county in the Nation. Again, taxpayers nationwide must support and sustain these projects despite their use by a few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The underlying bill provides funding for the Department of Transportation's 1-year pilot program that would allow a maximum of 100 Mexican trucks to enter and travel to a single destination in the United States this year. This pilot program is the result of planning and preparation over the past 14 years. NAFTA, passed by Congress in 1993 and signed into law by President Clinton in 1994, mandated the opening of our southern border to Mexican trucking operations. Congress set forth stringent preconditions  for opening the border in section 350 of the fiscal year 2002 transportation appropriations bill, and DOT complied with all 22 of those requirements. The Inspector General has  reported five times that the Department has substantially met those safety requirements. It is now time to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to my concerns with the transportation title, this bill provides more than $3 billion above the President's budget request for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Like previous years, the accompanying report contains an enormous number of earmarks in the Economic Development Initiative and neighborhood initiative accounts to the tune of more than 300 earmarks totaling nearly $300 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I would like to express my disappointment that Senate leadership has brought to the floor a bill that is $3 billion over the administration's request containing hundreds of earmarks. Rightly, the administration has announced that the President will veto this bill unless its price tag is reduced. That is the correct action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During my recent travels around the Nation, I hear again and again from citizens who are fed up with pork barrel spending and yet, Congress fails to listen. It is a shame, and I can only hope that the American people will join me in expressing their displeasure with this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="SECTION 8 HOUSING PAYMENTS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to support passage of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008. This bill provides critical funding for many of our Nation's essential programs, including housing for low-income families, community and economic development programs, and transportation needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Affordable housing is becoming less, not more, available in the United States. Research shows that the number of families facing severe housing cost burdens grew by almost 2 million households between 2001 and 2004. Additionally, one in three families spends more than 30 percent of its earnings on housing costs. The National Alliance to End Homelessness reports that at least 500,000 Americans are homeless every day and 2 million to 3 million Americans are homeless for various lengths of time  each year. Cities, towns, and rural communities across the country are confronting a lack of affordable housing for their citizens. This is not an issue that confronts just one region of the Nation or one group of Americans. Decent and affordable housing is essential to the well-being of Americans, and the Federal Government must provide adequate assistance to our citizens to ensure that all Americans can afford to live in safe and affordable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation provides critical funding for the section 8 voucher program. The section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program, originally created in 1974, is now the largest Federal housing program in terms of HUD's budget with approximately 2 million vouchers currently authorized. Yet the current number of vouchers does not come close to meeting the demand that exists in communities around our country. I am pleased this Senate bill contains funding for new vouchers for homeless veterans and disabled  families. This funding for new vouchers is a step in the right direction, but Congress needs to do much more to fund the section 8 program in the coming months and years to help ensure that funding levels for the program meet the demonstrated need for the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that this bill rejected many of the suggested cuts in the President's budget request. This bill provides $100 million for the Hope VI program, a program dedicated to rehabilitating our Nation's public housing. Many public housing authorities throughout the country, including in Milwaukee, have done great work with Hope VI dollars, and I am pleased the Senate rejected the President's cut to this important program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also provides increased funding for the Home Investment Partnerships Program, HOME, a program created in 1990 to assist States and local communities in producing affordable housing for low-income families. HOME is a grant program that allows participating jurisdictions the flexibility to use funds for new production, preservation, and rehabilitation of existing housing stock. Increased funding for HOME will help local communities, including those in Wisconsin, work to increase  the availability of affordable housing stock in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was pleased the Senate included my amendment calling on HUD to report on its funding needs for the section 8 project-based rental assistance program. In the past few months, many housing providers participating in the project-based program have not received their housing assistance payments from HUD as scheduled. Both HUD and OMB need to closely examine their budgeting process for the project-based program to try to ensure these late payments do not occur in the future. I have heard from housing  providers who are worried about how they will afford their mortgage payments and utility bills without timely payments from HUD. My amendment calls on HUD to provide Congress with an accurate accounting of the costs to completely fund all project-based contracts. I hope HUD will provide detailed information to Congress so we can address the shortfall this program is facing and help ensure that housing providers receive their payments from HUD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was pleased to support the investment in our vital transportation infrastructure in this legislation. After the tragic collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minnesota, I also supported providing the specific funds to rebuild this roadway and dedicating additional funds through the Murray amendment for the acute problem of structurally deficient bridges throughout the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this funding directed toward deficient bridges was an appropriate short-term investment, I would have concerns if it became a long-term policy. This concern is because shifting Federal funds toward the roads and bridges that have been the least well maintained can be a disincentive for States to make proper investments of their own and could result in a shift of funding from States, like Wisconsin, that have voluntarily made higher investments in their transportation infrastructure and  have fewer deficient structures to States that have not made a similar level of investment. Wisconsin's rate of return on the Federal fund to address deficient bridges is only 42 cents on a dollar paid in from Wisconsin taxpayers. I have fought for years to secure</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I supported the Dorgan/Specter amendment to prevent the implementation of the administration's new pilot program for Mexican trucks because the program raises serious safety and environmental concerns and could depress U.S. wages for truckers. This program is just another symptom of failed trade policies like NAFTA. Our trade policies should allow us to establish and enforce our own public safety, health, and environmental safeguards, which benefit American businesses, workers, and consumers,  instead of helping to ship millions of jobs overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am disappointed the President has issued a veto threat on this appropriations bill. This legislation provides necessary funding for a number of important Federal programs to improve the quality of life in our Nation's communities, including infrastructure and housing needs. Many American families are depending on the program funding included in this bill. I hope the President will reconsider and remove his veto threat on this important legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="SECTION 8 HOUSING PAYMENTS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak on the fiscal year 2008 Transportation-HUD appropriations bill, which was passed by the Senate earlier today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to begin by thanking Chairwoman MURRAY and Ranking Member BOND. Crafting legislation that seeks to meet the transportation and housing needs of our Nation is no easy feat, and I commend the hard work of the chairwoman, the ranking member, my colleagues on the subcommittee, and their staffs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation passed by the Senate provides nearly $105 billion for the upcoming fiscal year. Almost $66 billion is allocated to the Department of Transportation and nearly $39 billion is allocated to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to speak on some of the transit and housing provisions in this legislation that fall under the Banking Committee's jurisdiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note that although this bill provides an increase in transit funding over fiscal year 2007, it does not fund transit at the level authorized in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, SAFETEA-LU, the surface transportation authorization bill which Congress passed just 2 years ago. Safe and efficient transit systems provide significant benefits both to transit riders and to others in the community, including employers, property owners, and automobile  drivers. In fact, the Texas Transportation Institute has estimated that transit saves Americans over $18 billion a year by reducing the amount of time we spend in traffic. Moreover, in this era of high gasoline prices, public transportation provides an additional benefit: according to economists Robert Shapiro and Kevin Hassett, public</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Senators MURRAY and BOND, as well as my ranking member on the Banking Committee, Senator SHELBY, for working with me to include an amendment related to the Federal Transit Administration's proposed rule implementing the New Starts program. Through the New Starts program, the Federal Government helps to fund major transit investments in communities around the country. The proposed rule fails to follow SAFETEA-LU in several material respects, and at the  same time, introduces new concepts that were not authorized in SAFETEA-LU. This amendment makes clear that the FTA's failure to follow the law is unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that this bill provides additional funding, above the President's request, for many critical housing and community development programs. Unfortunately, the administration continues to request insufficient funds for these programs, and, in fact, each year has asked Congress to cut programs that assist our Nation's most vulnerable--children, seniors, and those with disabilities. Each year, we attempt to restore these cuts, and this year is no exception. Chairwoman MURRAY, and  Ranking Member BOND, strong supporters of these programs, have, once again, successfully restored most of the cuts, helping to ensure that low-income families will have safe, decent and affordable housing in strong communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The housing programs funded in this bill assist millions of families around our country. Without housing assistance, many families would lack the stability to find and retain employment, and many children would be unable to adequately perform in school because of multiple moves or health problems resulting from inadequate housing, including asthma, poor nutrition and lead poisoning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The wages of working families have not kept pace with housing costs. On average, a family in our country must earn $16.31 per hour at a full-time job in order to afford a modest 2-bedroom apartment without foregoing other basic needs. This amount is three times the minimum wage. In my home State of Connecticut, the wage needed to afford a modest 2-bedroom apartment is almost 4 times the minimum wage. This significant gap between the wages of low-income earners and housing costs makes evident  that housing assistance is necessary for many working Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill restores funding to the public housing program, which houses over 1.2 million of our Nation's lowest-income families. The public housing program has been targeted by this administration for deep cuts each year, and has lost hundreds of millions of dollars over the last 7 years. This year, the administration sought cuts to public housing funding of almost $500 million. The bill before us restores these cuts, increasing funding for the Public Housing Capital Fund by $61 million, the Operating  Fund by $336 million, and restoring funding for the successful Hope VI program. Even these levels of funding are lower than what is realistically needed by public housing agencies to operate all of their units, but we are pleased to see these increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we passed also increases funding for the Section 8 housing voucher program to ensure that all families currently in the program can retain housing. In addition, the bill provides funding for vouchers for veterans to make sure that American veterans have access to stable and affordable housing. It is a national disgrace that veterans, who have defended our country, are unable to access housing assistance in their times of need, and I strongly support the efforts of Senators MURRAY  and BOND to address this critical failure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Section 8 housing voucher program assists over 2 million families in affording rents in the private housing market. While the appropriators have done an exceptional job at protecting this program from budget cuts, a combination of legislative language and administrative changes have altered the funding formula in the Section 8 program numerous times over the last several years, leaving housing agencies without assurance that all of their units will be funded. I applaud Senators MURRAY  and BOND for</paragraph>
    <paragraph>including language in this bill retaining the Section 8 formula that was put in place last year--a formula that allocates funding in a reasonable way, and provides funding stability for housing agencies and the families they serve. I urge the chairwoman and ranking member to retain this formula throughout the whole appropriations process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also ensures that programs to house seniors, people with disabilities and people living with HIV/AIDS are fully funded. The President, astonishingly, requested a cut of $160 million to the senior housing program, and a cut of $112 million to the housing program for people with disabilities. I want to thank Chairwoman MURRAY and Ranking Member BOND for restoring these significant and shortsighted cuts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we passed also seeks to increase funding for CDBG and the HOME program, two flexible sources of funds that communities use to house families across the income spectrum, provide rental assistance, rehabilitate housing and public facilities, provide and sustain homeownership opportunities, and restore and strengthen communities. In this bill, CDBG funding has been increased by $288 million over last year's funding level, and HOME has been increased by over $200 million, including an additional</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This $100 million is critical to helping build the counseling infrastructure that can help tens of thousands of American families threatened with default and foreclosure save their homes, preserve their home equity, and maintain their dignity. As many of my colleagues know, the subprime mortgage market has been rife with abusive and predatory lending practices that have led to millions of Americans being trapped in adjustable rate mortgages, ARMs, with mortgage payments that will soon explode  to unaffordable levels. During hearings that I chaired in the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, senior executives from some of the largest subprime lenders acknowledged that they knew, when their companies funded these loans, that many of these borrowers could not afford these</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, the Center for Responsible Lending, CRL, released a report late last year predicting that 2.2 million families would lose their homes at a cost of $164 billion in hard-earned home equity. When this report was released, we heard howls of protest from many analysts and industry officials; yet, as the weeks and months go by, and each  new round of foreclosure statistics are released, the CRL number looks more and more accurate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The additional $100 million in counseling funds will help organizations with the experience and expertise to work with lenders and servicers to reach out to borrowers early--prior to loan resets, if possible--to try to modify loans to make them affordable for the long-term. This effort is crucial--one industry study indicates that over 6 million subprime borrowers, with over $1.5 trillion in home loans, will face mortgage loan resets in 2007 and beyond. Given the fact that we are already experiencing  historically high foreclosure rates, we need to take decisive action to keep hard-working Americans in their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this bill helps to ensure that low- and moderate-income families can afford decent and safe housing, I am concerned with the level of funding provided for Section 8 project-based assistance. This bill provides the level of funding requested by the administration; however, HUD recently alerted us that this is well below what is needed to pay for all project-based assistance contracts. Without adequate funding, property owners in the program will not be able to continue providing affordable  housing to low-income families. I have called on the administration to immediately provide Congress with an estimate of the amount of funds needed to fully fund these contracts for housing assistance, and yet we have not received this vital information. If there is a shortfall in this program, we will have to address this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I would like mention a few additional initiatives funded under this bill. I am pleased that Amtrak has received almost $1.4 billion in this legislation--funding that will ensure the continuation of passenger rail service in this country. I am also pleased that Senators MURRAY and BOND agreed to an amendment I cosponsored with Senator CLINTON regarding the redesigning of airspace over greater New York. Over the past several months, I have voiced concern over the  way the Federal Aviation Administration has proposed redesigning airspace in the Northeast. While I am supportive of the idea to reduce the air traffic congestion that currently plagues our country, I believe the FAA has an obligation to submit redesign proposals that are transparent and allow for full and informed public comment.

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I support the Senate Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008. This bill provides $105.6 billion in fiscal year 2008 for the Department of Transportation, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and a number of independent agencies. This legislation will improve road and bridge safety and address past shortfalls in spending on our Nation's infrastructure and housing and economic development  needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides $41.2 billion to the Federal-aid Highways Program for disbursement to States and local governments to build, maintain, and repair highways, roads and bridges; $1.074 billion of which would go to Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I supported an amendment which will provide increased funding for bridge replacement and rehabilitation. As a result of this amendment, Michigan would get an additional $23,539,287 for bridge replacement, bridge rehabilitation, preventative maintenance, seismic retrofitting, bridge inspections, and activities designed to protect bridges and extend their life spans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, 78,000 bridges around the country have been identified as structurally deficient. Given the high number of bridges that are in need of urgent repair, which was made all the more apparent by the recent and tragic bridge collapse in Minneapolis, it is appropriate for the Senate to direct more funding to address the urgency of this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also provides $9.59 billion to operate America's public transit systems around the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Public housing needs have been significantly underfunded over the past few years. I am pleased that this bill increased funding for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, to $38.74 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill increases funding to $4.2 billion for the public housing operating fund and to $2.5 billion for the public housing capital fund which will help provide assistance to low-income, disabled, senior citizens, and families throughout the country. This bill also provides $735 million for the HUD section 202 program and $237 million for the HUD section 811 program. These programs provide grants to nonprofits and community organizations for the development of rental assistance and supportive  housing for very low-income seniors and people with disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would also provide $52 million for fair housing activities through the Fair Housing Initiatives Program and the Fair Housing Assistance Program. Over 4 million fair housing violations occur each year in the United States, and these programs play a vital role in addressing housing discrimination in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since fiscal year 2001, funding for the Community Development Block Grants, CDBG, has been reduced by 15 percent, and the President's budget request for fiscal year 2008 would have reduced funding for this important program by another 20 percent. I am pleased that this bill includes $4.1 billion for CDBG, which provides State and local governments with block grants to fund local community development programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate has done its work in funding the important transportation systems that keep our vehicles and people moving safely and efficiently and our economy humming as well as funding the housing and economic development programs on which so many of our citizens rely. This is despite the President's threat to veto this bill. I hope the President will have a change of heart and support our effort to invest in America's future.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I congratulate and thank Senator Murray for being such an agile partner and such an effective leader. We finished the bill in almost record time. For a bill of this complexity, I might even claim it is record time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation is very complex. You have seen that it is controversial and can even be very political, as we saw with the Mexican trucking issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As always, Senator Murray deserves a great deal of credit and accolades for her ability to balance the many tough and controversial issues that make up the legislation, and to do so with a smile and good humor despite circumstances that would have brought out a more difficult response from a lesser person.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also thank her crack staff, including Peter Rogoff, Bill Simpson, Rachel Milberg, Meaghan McCarthy, and Teri Curtin. I also thank my staff for a great job: Jon Kamarck, Ellen Beares, and Matt McCardle. Each of them brought special contributions, as well as hard work, to the bill, spending many late nights and weekends to make sure the HUD fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill would reflect a balanced and bipartisan approach to the legislation that could be supported by Members on both sides  of the aisle. We thank the overwhelming majority who voted for it. A special thanks goes to our Republican and Democratic floor staff for bringing their special expertise and making us all look the part of respectable, hard-charging legislators and untangling the knots that sometimes occur in the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I did on Monday, I want to brag about our ability to include funding increases above the budget request for HUD's housing and community development programs. These are important programs to help build our communities and without which a number of persons--a significant number of persons--would be placed at risk of homelessness. That would have been a particular hardship on many seniors and persons with disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to repeat my gratitude that we were able to include $75 million in section 8 funds for the VA Affairs Supportive Housing Program. It is critical as service people continue to return from Iraq and face new realities  that can include the need for housing and other services. This program will become even more worthwhile as young, disabled service men and women make the difficult adjustment to civilian life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Members know, after 2 full days on this bill, with regard to FAA, this bill continues to support the beginning stage of the NextGen Air Transportation System. This bill also contains funds above the administration's request for flight inspection and certification personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These funds are needed and will ensure the continued safety of the National Airspace System. I also want to note the additional funds for the Airport Improvement Program, which has been and remains an important bipartisan priority for this subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the bill meets the guarantees of SAFETEA for highways and, and for the most part, transit. We include the revenue aligned budget authority, RABA, which was not included in the President's budget. In addition, we have included some $1 billion in obligation limitation as a starter account for the inspection of our aging bridges after those tragic deaths in Minnesota when the bridge collapsed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, as I noted previously, there are some issues that we will have to address before the bill can become law. For example, we include the revenue aligned budget authority which was not included in the President's budget. The bill also contains a $2.89 billion rescission of highway contract authority apportionments to the states, used as a budgetary offset. The bill also includes an additional $43,359,000 in Admin CA and another $172,243,000 in an unused transportation innovative financing  infrastructure account, TIFIA, contract authority for a total offset of spending of $3.495 billion. HUD also includes a rescission of $1.1 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I continue to be concerned over HUD's and OMB's failure to provide adequate funding for HUD's section 8 project-based housing program for fiscal year 2008. This is not an option but is a contractual obligation. Most important, this is a critical and important program that serves many of our most vulnerable citizens such as extremely low-income families, including seniors and persons with disabilities. HUD has been unable to fund fully or timely many of these contracts during fiscal year  2007, and I understand that this problem will only get worse in fiscal year 2008 with HUD facing a shortfall in its section 8 project-based account of $2 billion or more. I know this program enjoys wide support in this Congress and I would fully expect OMB to provide the necessary funds for the program through a budget amendment or as part of a continuing resolution or through emergency supplemental legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while I am pleased with much of the bill, especially needed spending in critical programs, I am concerned that we are on a collision course with the White House on the spending levels contained in this bill. I fear that both sides are going to have to make adjustments. I just hope that any adjustments do not result in the loss of any of the positive investments made we have made in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will conclude by again thanking my colleague, Senator Murray, her staff, my staff, and the floor staff. Thanks for the help of everybody.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300076" topic="GENERAL PROVISIONS THIS ACT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, who has worked hard with me, the staff, and all of us who have been working to get this bill to the floor and pass it. It is an extremely difficult bill, covering a wide variety of programs and projects throughout the country. We started this process way back in the beginning of the year with the budget process. He and I spent many conversations on the phone working together, getting our bill through subcommittee,  full committee, and now to the Senate floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could not have done it without Senator Bond's help and support, particularly in the housing arena, helping to work through a lot of difficult issues. I thank him in particular for his diligence and his ability to help us get through this today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, I thank his staff: Jon Kamarck, Ellen Beares, and Matt McCardle. They have been there time and again to help us work through the issues. I thank my staff: Peter Rogoff, Rachel Milberg, Bill Simpson, Meaghan McCarthy, and Terri Curtin. They spent innumerable all-night sessions trying to get us to reach deadlines and get the bill to the Senate floor. Without their expertise, we would not be here. I thank them on behalf of all of us in this country. I thank, from my personal staff, Travis  Lumpkin, who has been here working with us to get this bill through, as well as Mike Spahn, of my floor staff, who spent a lot of time helping us work through all the difficult parts of the bill. It takes a lot of people to get a bill of this complexity to the floor, and every one of them should be recognized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot do these bills on our own. A lot of people put a lot of time and energy into getting us to this point. I thank Senators BYRD and COCHRAN, the chairman and ranking member of the full committee, who have worked with all of us on appropriations to get our work done in a timely fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is headed to conference. It is an extremely important bill. As we have heard throughout the last days as we have debated the bill, every American is touched by the impact of this legislation. If you get up and go to work, whether you drive or, as we heard yesterday, ride a bike; whether you go on an Amtrak train or if you have to fly, what we decide in this bill and how we set spending priorities makes a difference in your life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many Americans who are facing a housing crisis today, this bill addresses those concerns, as the Senator from Missouri talked about. This is an extremely important piece of legislation. We received the President's budget with severe cuts in Amtrak, in housing, in FAA modernization, and many more that I have talked about over the last several days. This Senate has said we have to invest in the infrastructure of this country. We need to move forward in making sure that average, everyday Americans  who get up and go to work, enjoy time with their families, who want to be able to participate in our communities, have a right to do that, and we have an obligation as a Congress to make sure the infrastructure is in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to continue to work on this bill with our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol, our House counterparts. I hope we can get a bill to the President and get it signed and move these programs forward so the money we have debated and talked about will be allocated and our communities across this country will benefit from it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I again thank my colleague from Missouri.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="GENERAL PROVISIONS THIS ACT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to make a few comments about <bill type="h" number="3074">H.R. 3074</bill>, the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Act of 2007, which we passed earlier today by an overwhelming bipartisan majority. This bill will make much-needed investments in aging roads and bridges around the country. It will help make the skies safer for travel. It will revitalize struggling communities with economic development grants. And it will get a roof over the heads of many of the 200,000  veterans who find themselves homeless on any given night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman MURRAY, Ranking Member BOND, Chairman Byrd, Ranking Member COCHRAN, and all the members of the committee for their work on a bill that makes such wise investments in our transportation, in our communities, and in our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This summer, as Americans took to the highways with their families, traveling long stretches of bumpy roads across aging bridges on their way to their vacation destination, they were  painfully aware of our Government's neglect of our transportation infrastructure over the last several years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Potholes and traffic jams can take a toll on your car and your pocketbook. A 2006 survey showed that driving on rough roads is costing the average urban motorist about $383 a year in added vehicle maintenance costs. With gas inching back toward $3 a gallon, that is an added strain on a family's budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond this economic strain, though, failing and deteriorating infrastructure can lead to tragic consequences. Roadway conditions are a significant factor in approximately one-third of traffic fatalities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The August 1 collapse of I-35W in Minneapolis was among the most tragic examples of this danger. Thirteen people died, and around 100 were injured, when the eight-lane truss bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Minneapolis disaster has engineers and planners around the country taking a second look at the condition of their bridges. And what they are finding is troubling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Colorado, nearly 7 percent of our bridges are structurally deficient and need immediate attention. 110 bridges that belong to the State need full replacement. Another 375 need rehabilitation. Unfortunately, the backlog of bridgework that needs to be done in our State is an overwhelming $758 million. In Colorado and across the country, we desperately need more resources to get this work done. I believe the Senate made a wise investment when it voted overwhelmingly in support of Senator Murray's  amendment to add $1 billion in dedicated funding for the Federal Highway Administration's bridge replacement and rehabilitation program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also must recommit ourselves to investing in our roads and highways. They are the veins of commerce that sustain our economy. Our ability to move goods and people quickly and safely is absolutely fundamental to continued growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people, and the people of Colorado, understand this. When I visit a town like Gunnison, maintenance and improvements to Highway 50, which links Pueblo and the Front Range with Gunnison and the Western Slope, is at the top of the list for local elected officials. When I visit Eagle County, Clear Creek County, and Summit County, I-70 investments are front and center. And when I meet with officials in Lamar, Springfield, and Eads, maintenance of Highway 287, part of the "Ports to Plains"  corridor, is the topic of conversation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For each of these communities, good roads are essential for economic vitality. Across the political spectrum, across a broad range of interests and professions, Coloradans understand this. Two years ago, we voted to allow the state government to retain an additional $5.7 billion in revenues over 5 years to help fund our schools and our roads. The statewide referendum passed comfortably because the Colorado business community knows that failing infrastructure is a drag on an economy. Smart investments  in bridges, roads, and airports yield strong returns over the long term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we passed earlier today makes these needed investments in our Nation's transportation infrastructure. It allocates $65.7 billion to transportation, including $40.2 billion for highway construction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This will allow for us to move ahead with several vital projects in Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Notably, the bill includes $5 million for continued construction of a new interchange near Gate 20 at Fort Carson. The Mountain Post is accommodating two additional brigades and is growing by approximately 12,000 troops over the next 2 years. Gate 20 allows soldiers and contractors to enter the base from Fountain, Pueblo, and points south of the base. The base commander, General Mixon, sees this as a top priority and we help him fulfill it with this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the bill provides $2 million for work on the Ports to Plains Highway, U.S. 287, near Lamar. This builds on the over $11 million we have invested in his project over the past 3 years to build the capacity of this major north-south commercial artery. I have driven that road many times over the past few years, and it is improving steadily. You see more trucks on that road now, and you see more goods moving to market more quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In southern Colorado, we have included funding to restore a road leading to one of our newest national parks, Great Sand Dunes, in my native San Luis Valley. 300,000 visitors a year come to Great Sand Dunes. It is a boon to the local economy, and the $3 million for resurfacing State Highway 150 to the Sand Dunes will help more Americans see this treasure of the American West.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the transportation portion of this bill does not simply fund new roads. It also includes forward-thinking investments in mass transit solutions to reduce the wear and tear on our highways, to save gas, and to unclog traffic jams. This bill includes $70 million for the Denver Regional Transportation District's West Corridor Light Rail Project and $70 million for RTD's Southeast Corridor Multi-Modal Project. Coloradans know it as T-Rex. It blends light rail and highway improvements in one of  the largest mass transit projects that is underway in the United States. It is changing how people commute and where they are choosing to live. This bill keeps Denver's transportation revolution on track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would also like to express my strong support for the funding this legislation makes available for the community development block grant program. I have heard from public officials across Colorado, and they all tell me that the CDBG program is one of the most effective Federal Government programs available to cities, towns, and rural communities in our State, and across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, Colorado alone received nearly $40 million from the CDBG program, with several towns and cities receiving in excess of $1.5 million apiece. While the President's budget would have cut this funding by 20 percent, the underlying legislation restores those cuts and provides $3.77 billion for the program. We should not be slashing funding for one of our most effective and efficient tools for energizing communities and improving housing infrastructure. This bill does the right thing and  restores this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of the bill that we passed--it sets the right priorities and makes smart investments in our transportation infrastructure and in our communities. I want to again thank Chairman MURRAY, Ranking Member BOND, the Appropriations Committee, and their staffs for their work on this bill. I hope it is signed into law.</paragraph>
