  <narrative>
    <bill type="h" number="2040">H.R. 2040</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Civil Rights Act of 1964 Commemorative Coin Act".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Congress hereby finds as follows:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks' brave act of defiance, refusing to give up her seat to a white person on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama, galvanized the modern civil rights movement and led to the desegregation of the South.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) On February 1, 1960, 4 college students, Joseph McNeil, Franklin McCain, David Richmond, and Ezell Blair, Jr., asked to be served at a lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, and lunch counter sit-ins began to occur throughout the South to challenge segregation in places of public accommodation.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) On May 4, 1961, the Freedom Rides into the South began to test new court orders barring segregation in interstate transportation, and riders were jailed and beaten by mobs in several places, including Birmingham and Montgomery, Alabama.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was the leading civil rights advocate of the time, spearheading the civil rights movement in the United States during the 1950s and 1960s with the goal of nonviolent social change and full civil rights for African Americans.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) On August 28, 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., led over 250,000 civil rights supporters in the March on Washington and delivered his famous "I Have A Dream" speech to raise awareness and support for civil rights legislation.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) Mrs. Coretta Scott King, a leading participant in the American civil rights movement, was side-by-side with her husband, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., during many civil rights marches, organized Freedom Concerts to draw attention to the Movement, and worked in her own right to create an America in which all people have equal rights.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) The mass movement sparked by Rosa Parks and led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., among others, called upon the Congress and Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson to pass civil rights legislation which culminated in the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) The Civil Rights Act of 1964 greatly expanded civil rights protections, outlawing racial discrimination and segregation in public places and places of public accommodation, in federally funded programs, and employment and encouraging desegregation in public schools, and has served as a model for subsequent anti-discrimination laws.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) We are an eminently better Nation because of Rosa Parks, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and all those men and women who have confronted, and continue to confront, injustice and inequality wherever they see it.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) Equality in education was one of the cornerstones of the civil rights movement.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) On September 10, 1961, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote that African American "students are coming to understand that education and learning have become tools for shaping the future and not devices of privilege for an exclusive few".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (12) Over its long and distinguished history, the United Negro College Fund has provided scholarships and operating funds to its member colleges that have enabled more than 300,000 young African Americans to earn college degrees and become successful members of society.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (13) Those graduates include Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., as well as leaders in the fields of education, science, medicine, law, entertainment, literature, the military, and politics who have made major contributions to the civil rights movement and the creation of a more equitable society.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (14) Congress has an obligation to lead America's continued struggle to fight discrimination and ensure equal rights for all.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (15) The year 2014 will mark the semicentennial of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Denominations.--The Secretary of the Treasury (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the "Secretary") shall mint and issue not more than 350,000 $1 coins each of which shall--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) weigh 26.73 grams;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) have a diameter of 1.500 inches; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) contain 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Legal Tender.--The coins minted under this Act shall be legal tender, as provided in section 5103 of title 31, United States Code.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (c) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of section 5136 of title 31, United States Code, all coins minted under this Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 4.

  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) and the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Heller) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself just a couple of minutes here at the beginning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very, very important and timely piece of legislation. <bill type="h" number="2040">H.R. 2040</bill> is the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Commemorative Coin Act. As a steadfast proponent of this most important legislation, it is indeed my honor and privilege.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First and foremost, I wish to commend my good friend and my own personal hero and mentor from the great State of Georgia, my colleague, Mr. JOHN LEWIS, on the extraordinary work that he has done throughout his entire life, and certainly on the work to bring this commemorative coin bill recognizing the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to the floor with the minting of a $1 coin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the bill for honoring not only the importance of this legislation, but also the many contributions of so many Americans from all walks of life, from all different backgrounds that have come together to make this country great, and certainly have made outstanding contributions during the civil rights era.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I further want to acknowledge the vital role of the United Negro College Fund, UNCF, that they have played in ensuring access to and opportunities for higher education for so many deserving students who, if it had not been for the UNCF, would not have received a college education. During its 64-year existence, the UNCF has raised more than $2.3 billion to support its 39 Historically Black Colleges and University member institutions. And during 2007, the UNCF raised an impressive $220 million  in scholarships to help some 65,000 students realize their dreams of receiving a college education. So it's important for us to note that this is more than just a piece of legislation for it's important to note that the proceeds from the sale of this coin will go towards advancing what the Civil Rights Act initially made possible, opportunity for education and empowerment by benefiting the United Negro College Fund and those member schools which played such a vital role, Madam Speaker, in the sit-ins, they started on black college campuses, on the marches, the civil rights marches</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, granted we've come a long way. However, there is still much, much work to do. I am living proof that minorities are able to elect the candidate of their choice as I was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives 34 years ago, becoming the youngest legislator to serve in the State House of Representatives at that time. I owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to those who came before me, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been instrumental in achieving all of these successes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I submit the following correspondence for the RECORD:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, March 6, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN FRANK, I am writing regarding <bill type="h" number="2040">H.R. 2040</bill>, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Commemorative Coin Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, the Committee on Ways and Means maintains jurisdiction over bills that raise revenue. <bill type="h" number="2040">H.R. 2040</bill> contains a provision that establishes a surcharge for the sale of commemorative coins that are minted under the bill, and thus falls within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, as part of our ongoing understanding regarding commemorative coin bills and in order to expedite this bill for Floor consideration, the Committee will forgo action. This is being done with the understanding that it does not in any way prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would appreciate your response to this letter, confirming this understanding with respect to <bill type="h" number="2040">H.R. 2040</bill>, and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charles B. Rangel,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph> HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, March 6, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear Charlie: I am writing in response to your letter regarding <bill type="h" number="2040">H.R. 2040</bill>, the "Civil Rights Act of 1964 Commemorative Coin Act," which was introduced in the House and referred to the Committee on Financial Services on April 25, 2007. It is my understanding that this bill will be scheduled for floor consideration shortly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> I wish to confirm our mutual understanding on this bill. As you know, section 7 of the bill establishes a surcharge for the sale of commemorative coins that are minted under the bill. I acknowledge your committee's jurisdictional interest in such surcharges as revenue matters. However, I appreciate your willingness to forego committee action on <bill type="h" number="2040">H.R. 2040</bill> in order to allow  the bill to come to the floor expeditiously. I agree that your decision to forego  further action on this bill will not prejudice the Committee on Ways and Means with respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this or similar legislation. I would support your request for conferees on these provisions within your jurisdiction should this bill be the subject of a House-Senate conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will include this exchange of letters in the Congressional Record when this bill is considered by the House. Thank you again for your assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barney Frank,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412218" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it's a great honor to rise today to support passage of legislation honoring the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with the minting of a commemorative $1 coin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a particular honor to be working on a bill sponsored by one of the heroes of the civil rights movement, Congressman JOHN LEWIS and my colleague DEBORAH PRYCE.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Civil Rights Act is widely recognized as one of the most effective, influential pieces of legislation passed by the United States Congress in the last century. The statute helped dismantle the insidious system of legalized discrimination in voting and public accommodations in America and served as a model for subsequent civil rights laws. Equally important, the Civil Rights Act helped America belatedly reach the promise put forth by our Founding Fathers, that all men are indeed  created equal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Act is the bedrock for the America we know today, a Nation that recognizes the equal rights of the disabled, women, the elderly, minority citizens, and other groups as invaluable contributors to our society, and all inherently equally deserving of the protections afforded by our Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today provides for the minting of a Civil Rights Commemorative Coin, with the proceeds expected to raise up to $2.5 million for the United Negro College Fund, providing scholarships and internships for minority students and assisting our Nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities. As the bill honors our Nation's past, it helps to fund our Nation's future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is a great honor for me to be joined in this legislative effort by Congressman JOHN LEWIS. Mr. Lewis, the principal sponsor, is a man whose courage, thoughtful advocacy, and leadership in the struggle for civil rights speaks for itself. His brave leadership in the first Selma to Montgomery march, and his support for nonviolent revolution in the face of the brutal attacks of that fateful Sunday are the very acts of courage the coin seeks to honor for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is especially auspicious that we are taking up the bill this week, because Friday marks the tragic 40th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Today, we can help honor his legacy and his indelible and inalterable imprint on America by authorizing a tribute to his historic works in the form of a commemorative coin. While it is but a small tribute to a man who gave his life for our betterment, it is a permanent statement of gratitude from a Nation forever thankful for  his vision, compassion, and determination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, pick up any newspaper in the country and you will see that the topic of race relations continues to be an important part of our American dialogue. But we should not be a Nation that hides from its past. We cannot sweep our past mistakes under the rug and refrain from debate on topics that we might find uncomfortable. Rather, we must know that the fight for equality for all is never ending and that recognizing and understanding our Nation's past is critical if we are to ensure a  just America for all in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fight for civil rights continues, and the Civil Rights Commemorative Coin honors both our Nation's historic struggles and the promise for justice and equality for all the generations that will follow us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge immediate passage of this bill, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me just extend my deep appreciation to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Heller) for his kind words. They were very touching and meaningful. Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Madam Speaker, if I may yield time to probably the most fitting and appropriate person to speak on this bill, the author of the bill, my friend and a man who has put his life on the line repeatedly for civil rights, for human rights and for making this country and the world the beloved place that we all seek. Let me yield as much time as he may need to my good friend, John Lewis of Georgia.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400240" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friends and my two colleagues for those kind words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm honored to stand here today as the chief sponsor of this legislation to recognize the brave and courageous men and women who paved the way for the historic, and necessary, set of laws we call the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We would not be standing here today with this bill being considered on the floor, with 313 cosponsors, without the help of my good friend and colleague, Representative Vic Snyder. Representative Snyder was a champion of this bill. I appreciate his support of this bill and the ideas behind it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to acknowledge Congresswoman Deborah Pryce for her willingness to cosponsor this bill with me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks' brave act of defiance, refusing to give up her seat to a white person on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama, galvanized the modern-day civil rights movement. I remember as a young child, 15 years old, listening to the radio and hearing about Rosa Parks and the voice of Martin Luther King, Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their work inspired me and so many others to take up the cause of equality and join the movement. We must never forget the sacrifices that so many made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud, very proud, to be the lead sponsor of this legislation, which celebrates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and to remember those who fought for its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2014, the 50th anniversary of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, commemorative coins will be minted with the images of the brave men and women who fought, and even died, for these laws. These coins will serve as educational tools for our children and their children, so that the struggle that so many took part in will never, ever be forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was necessary, and it was right to pass. It greatly expanded civil rights protections. It outlawed segregation and racial discrimination in public places, places of public accommodation, the workplace, and even in federally funded programs. It also pushed to end segregation in our Nation's schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is only right then that we are working with the United Negro College Fund to commemorate the 50th anniversary of this historic milestone. Discrimination in our education system was real. For many African Americans, their only hope for a college education was through a UNCF school. UNCF institutions were founded to provide an education for African Americans who were banned by law or by custom from seeking a college education in the all-white public and private universities of the South.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, UNCF continues their important mission of opening the doors to a college education. Over 60 percent of UNCF-supported students are the first in their families to attend college. By helping to fund the UNCF, these coins will put in reach a college education for first-generation students while also helping to ensure these important institutions of higher education remain open for future and unborn generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm proud to stand here today as we pay tribute to the 1964 Civil Rights Act and to remember those who made it possible. There is still much work to be done, and we must continue to fight today, tomorrow, and into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, now I would like to extend and yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, first of all, I want to thank Representative Scott from Georgia for yielding time, and I also want to commend the sponsor of this legislation  and recognize his tremendous leadership in the struggle for human rights since his teen years when he was a mere lad. We heard him mention the age of 15, and that's about the time that he became actively engaged and involved in the struggle for human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation highlights the Voting Rights Act of 1964, which even though all people in our country supposedly had the right to vote prior to that time, it provided the kind of protections that were necessary to make sure that those rights were not taken away, that those rights were not denied.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to commend Representative Lewis for his creative way of helping to raise money for the United Negro College Fund. I've been getting phone calls from my brother all week, and I know why he's calling me, because every year he and a friend of his, Jackis Casson, put on an event to raise money for the United Negro College Fund. And so he's been calling to solicit me to buy my tickets, and so the more money that we can generate through this legislation, the less money I might  have to give.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I commend you so much and thank you so much.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412218" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this has been an extraordinary occasion. It is very important to remember where we have been so that we will have a good guide to determine where we need to go, and we have done that this afternoon in not only memorializing this important Civil Rights Act, but using this memorial of the 50th anniversary of the passing of the Civil Rights Act to make a difference where it counts the most, and that is in helping with the education of our young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have, indeed, made a difference here today. I recommend this bill, and we feel very strongly that we will get a unanimous vote on this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400030" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2040">H.R. 2040</bill> which is authored by my good friend from the Georgia delegation, Mr. John Lewis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Almost 44 years ago, the Civil Rights Act was passed into law. The legislation was a long time in coming--in 1957 and 1960 similar legislation had failed to pass Congress, and many attempts were made to derail the bill that was eventually signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson on July 2, 1964.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> However, the period leading up to passage of the Civil Rights Act seemed to happen in the blink of an eye compared to the long and arduous journey we have endured since. Ensuring equality for men and women of every race, creed, and orientation, though fixed in our laws in 1964, was not immediately fixed in the hearts and minds of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Martin Luther King once said, "The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice."</paragraph>
    <paragraph> So it has been with civil rights in this country. And, just as passage of antidiscrimination legislation did not end social discord in 1964, memorializing the Civil Rights Act on a coin from the U.S. Treasury, as <bill type="h" number="2040">H.R. 2040</bill> proposes, does not mean discrimination has run its course in the United States. More than ever, as the United States struggles with the problem of so many foreign born living in this country, contemplates the idea of a black man or a woman as the President of this country,  and negotiates with nations whose religion and morals differ widely from our own, we need to remember the values inherent in the Civil Rights Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> I commend Mr. Lewis and all the cosponsors for bringing this legislation to the floor and I urge all my colleagues to join us in support of it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2040">H.R. 2040</bill>, requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in commemoration of the semicentennial of the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, introduced by my distinguished colleague from Georgia, Representative John Lewis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> I speak out today to commemorate the progress we have made in casting out the demons of prejudice and discrimination. I speak out today recognize the steps we have taken as a Nation to get closer to the American Creed. However, I must also speak out today to call attention to the progress we have yet to make in order to fulfill the tenants of Civil Rights Act of 1964. I speak out today to challenge this Nation to uphold our founding principles of equal opportunity for all, regardless of race,  color, sex, religion and national origin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Though 44 years have passed since the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, today, in 2008, we are still witnessing horrible violations of the principles of this act. To cite a recent example, in Waller County, Texas, an attempted disenfranchisement of Prairie View A&amp;M University students continues today, although the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed Prairie View A&amp;M University student voter rights in 1979.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> On November 5, 2003, the Waller County, Texas district attorney requested that the county Elections Administration bar the students at Historically Black College Prairie View A&amp;M University from voting locally by virtue of his unilateral interpretation of "domicile" for voting purposes. Texas voter registration law only requires a person to be a resident of the county at least 30 days prior to the elections. African-American students represent the majority of Prairie View A&amp;M's student body  of 7,000 members, and these students constitute a major voting bloc in Waller County. The district attorney's request sought to effectively disenfranchise African-American college students in this area; as such, this request suggested a form of voter intimidation and likely had the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account</paragraph>
    <paragraph> The Civil Rights Act of 1964 Commemorative Coin Act requires the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue, during 2014, up to 350,000 $1 coins designed to be emblematic of the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its contribution to civil rights in America. This coin would symbolize our progress, commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and serve as a constant reminder of the work we still have to do. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 Commemorative Coin Act would  also provide a surcharge of $10 per coin. All surcharges received in conjunction with the sale of this coin would be paid to the United Negro College Fund, UNCF. The $10 per coin surcharge will help the UNCF provide scholarships and internships for minority students. The money will also provide operating funds and technology enhancement services for 39 member historically Black colleges and universities throughout America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Madam Speaker, this important legislation would commemorate a landmark event in our history as Americans. By requiring the Secretary of the Treasurer to mint coins in commemoration of the semicentennial of the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, this legislation will celebrate our history, while also pushing us forward into a better future. For these reasons, I strongly support <bill type="h" number="2040">H.R. 2040</bill> and urge all Members to do the same.</paragraph>
