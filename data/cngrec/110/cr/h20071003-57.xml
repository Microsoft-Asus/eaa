  <narrative>EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR COLOMBIA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11229]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mario Diaz-Balart) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400108" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for enacting a free trade agreement with our strongest ally in Latin America, and that is Colombia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In May, the House leadership brokered an agreement with the administration to pass the Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea Free Trade Agreements, in that order, Mr. Speaker. And, actually, I am very pleased to see that the House Ways and Means Committee took action this week on the Peru Free Trade Agreement. I think it's a great step in the right direction. However, I am concerned about the apparent lack of support from the House leadership for a Colombia Free Trade Agreement, an agreement  that publicly was committed to by the House leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that this Congress pass a Colombia Free Trade Agreement. Excluding our strongest ally in Latin America from preferential trade treatment would send a devastating message to the region. That message would be that if you are a strong ally, the strongest ally of the United States, if you are willing to stand up to anti-American dictators like Mr. Hugo Chavez, and if you are willing to fight the narcoterrorists, this United States Congress will not support you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A free trade agreement with Colombia would not only help further bolster the Colombian economy and help show our strong support for their efforts in fighting the war on drugs, it would also help the U.S. economy by opening up our business to this huge democracy, this huge export market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we cannot send the world the message that if you support the United States, if you are willing to stand up even against our enemies, that this United States Congress will not stand with you. Please, let's not slight the Colombian people and their democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the Democratic leadership and the House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Speaker, to bring forward a Colombia Free Trade Agreement.</paragraph>
