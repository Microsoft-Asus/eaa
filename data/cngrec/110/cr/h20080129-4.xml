  <narrative>HONORING THE LIFE OF GWEN BRITT -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H481]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, along with my colleagues from the Maryland delegation, I want to take this opportunity to honor the life and legacy of a beloved figure from our State who passed into God's hands on January 12, State Senator Gwen Britt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gwen lived a full, wonderful life. She was a wife, a mother, a grandmother, legislator, a civil rights leader and a friend. But she also was an inspiration, a woman of deep faith and conviction, with an unshakable commitment to achieving justice, equality and fairness in our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The former Gwendolyn Greene grew up in northeast Washington at a time when our Nation was failing to live up to its promise of equal opportunity. She knew the racial divisions that existed in this segregated city, in our schools, in our stores, even in our parks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so in 1960, as an 18-year-old student activist of Howard University, Gwen and members of the District of Columbia's non-violent action group decided to take a stand. She walked into the Montgomery County park, then segregated, and tried to climb aboard a horse on a merry-go-round; something that all of us today would think is normal for any American, particularly any young American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet as the Washington Post reported, the students' actions, as innocent and as unprovocative as they seem today, sparked 5 days of protests, and Gwen and other activists were arrested for trespassing, spat upon and harassed by counter-demonstrators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This experience left Gwen undeterred. In fact, it fortified her already strong character, as well as her determination to do what she knew in her mind and in her heart was right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gwen took to heart Dr. King's words, "Make a career of humanity, and you will make a greater person of yourself, a greater Nation of your country and a finer world to live in." So said Martin Luther King, Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gwen Britt took that to heart. So she did make our Nation a finer place in which to live. That experience in Glen Echo Park was only the beginning of Gwen's civil rights work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She left Howard University to join the Freedom Riders who challenged Jim Crow laws in the South and in our transportation system. And in 1961, she spent 40 days in a Mississippi jail for sitting in a whites-only train station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Lewis was one of Gwen Britt's friends. John Lewis, a hero, a Member of this body. More people know about John Lewis because of his extraordinary leadership, but Gwen Britt was there by his side on Freedom Rides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a testament to Gwen Britt's humility and quiet confidence that she never advertised her proud and very important civil rights work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Maryland State Delegate Victor Ramirez of Prince George's County recently said, "She talked about the civil rights movement if you brought it up, but she was one of those people who spoke softly but carried a big stick."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since her passing, words of tribute have poured forth. Governor Martin O'Malley noted, "She was a leader long before her years in the Senate." How true that is. Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown called her a "principled, active and fair-minded voice for equality."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And Prince George's County executive Jack Johnson said she was "one of the most honest people you ever met." And on The Washington Post's Web site, people who knew Gwen posted words of sympathy and tribute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, Katey Boerner, the executive director of the Glen Echo Park Partnership for Arts and Culture, has said some, almost 50 years after the demonstration that occurred to open up Glen Echo's amusements to people of all colors, "We plan to include her story of bravery and shepherding change in our upcoming civil rights exhibition here at the park. We can now treasure her memory for the amazing story that was her life and the impact that she had on so many through her leadership."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not surprisingly, Gwen Britt also made an important impact in the State Senate after she was elected in 2002. She rose to the position of deputy majority leader in 2007 and became an unwavering voice for those who have felt the cold chill of exclusion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Carl Snowden, the director of civil rights in the State Attorney General's Office in Maryland, said this, "She saw other groups that have historically been locked out of the system: women, Latinos, gays. And she felt all of those left out had to have a place at the table."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gwen Britt was a woman of extraordinary character and courage, and all those she touched during her 66 years on this earth, her beloved family; her sons, who spoke so eloquently at her funeral; her husband, who himself was a Freedom Rider, who himself was a great warrior and advocate for justice in the civil rights movement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State of Maryland and our Nation have been enriched by her actions and her leadership, as a young person, as a State Senator, as a neighbor, as a friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I want to extend my condolences to Gwen's husband of 46 years, Travis; her two sons, Travis, Jr., and John; and all of her family and many friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will miss her dearly, although we are comforted that her life and legacy will endure and that she now is at rest in God's hands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gwen will live as so many before, in the hearts and minds of those she impressed, of those she motivated, of those she enriched. We will miss Senator Gwen Britt, but our State, our community and our Nation have been made better by her life.</paragraph>
