    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Minnesota is known as a State of great longevity. We have the longest married couple in the history of the United States living in my district. We also have some of the longest living people in the United States in my district. This week I had the occasion to wish one of my constituents happy birthday on her 102nd birthday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to honor another constituent from my hometown who is 100 this week. I want to wish happy birthday to Erna Welte of Stillwater, Minnesota. She has seen the Great Depression, she has seen World War II, she has seen the space race. She has been alive before television and during television. She has seen it all. But Erna says, "I don't feel that old." She's young at heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just recently, when she celebrated 90 years of age, her granddaughter taught Erna how to drive a car. For the first time, she learned to drive a car. She's a wonderful, witty, wise individual, and I am so grateful for the senior citizens of the United States, particularly those long-living, happy people who live in my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Erna, happy birthday to you, and to our Nation's finest, our senior citizens.</paragraph>
