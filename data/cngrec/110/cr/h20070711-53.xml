    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and honor Miss Katja Martin, a sixth grade student from my district, who is an inspired writer and gifted reader and writer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, the Library of Congress has selected Miss Katja Martin of Appharetta, Georgia as one of only six national winners in their annual "Letters About Literature" program. With more than 56,000 adolescent and young adult readers in fourth through 12th grades participating, this program encourages students to read and be inspired and to write a letter that might have been sent to an author who has changed the student's view of the world and of themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For her entry, Miss Martin wrote about the Robert Frost poem, "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening." Because of her talented efforts, she and the other five national winners will be honored at the National Book Festival on September 29 here in Washington, DC, where they will have the opportunity to read their letters to the gathered audience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to have the House recognize this accomplishment. It's a great honor for me to be able to represent and recognize Katja Martin, clearly a dedicated and intelligent young lady.</paragraph>
