    <paragraph>Mr. President, on September 29, 2007, Mr. Hiro Paul Mizue, Chief of the Civil and Public Works Branch, Honolulu Engineer District, HED, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, will retire from U.S. Government service following 34 years of exemplary service to Hawaii, the Pacific Region, the U.S. military, and our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the course of these 34 years, Mr. Mizue has served with integrity and distinction. I have personally witnessed his conviction to duty and steadfast dedication to improving the lives of citizens and servicemembers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Mizue has demonstrated the highest values and ideals over his years of distinguished service, excelling at every assignment in his career, which covers every facet of civil and military planning and design management. He has exercised exceptional leadership and management skills on behalf of the Army Corps of Engineers to achieve much lauded success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His professional career in water resources began with the Los Angeles County Flood Control District in 1968 as a hydraulic engineer. Called to duty by the U.S. Army in 1969, he was assigned to HED as a civil engineer where he worked in the Civil Works Branch at Fort Armstrong. Upon discharge in 1971, he returned to the Los Angeles Flood Control District. In 1974, he relocated to Hawaii, joining the Honolulu firm of Belt Collins and Associates as a civil engineer. He rejoined the Honolulu District  in late 1975 as a hydraulic engineer, managing water resources feasibility studies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1983, Mr. Mizue transferred to HED's military engineering division where he served as the Chief of the Family Housing/Hospital Division until 1995. During this period, he provided exceptional project management support culminating with $271 million in construction of new family housing for our brave servicemembers on Hickam AFB, Wheeler AAF, Schofield Barracks, Aliamanu Military Reservation, and Fort Shafter. Also of note are Mr. Mizue's efforts in managing $100 million in design-build  contracts for a much needed expansion of the Tripler Army Medical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having demonstrated exemplary leadership and management skills, Mr. Mizue was promoted to Chief of Planning Division in 1995; this office later became Civil and Public Works Branch. In this capacity, Mr. Mizue provided high-quality planning services to the State of Hawaii, Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, and American Samoa. In addition, he implemented comprehensive/holistic planning by having Corps planning studies evaluate water resources problems broadly and at a watershed level.  This approach formed the basis for Federal, State, and local agencies to implement integrated water resources development projects. Mr. Mizue typified customer care by constantly striving to provide the highest quality planning services and products in a responsive manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, Mr. Mizue led HED's response to assist the State and counties with dam safety inspections after the Kaloko Dam failure and later following a 6.7-magnitude earthquake. HED's responses to these disasters demonstrated the exceptional working relationship with the State of Hawaii. Through his leadership, expertise, and experience, HED became recognized as the proven leader in project execution, accomplishment, and responsiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his 12 years as Chief of Civil and Public Works Branch for the Honolulu District, Mr. Mizue parlayed his extensive leadership skills to accomplish notable Branch achievements. A major civil works project built during his tenure was the Alenaio Stream Flood Control project, on the Big Island, completed in 1997 at a cost of $16  million. During the storm of November 2000, the improvement prevented approximately $13 million worth of damages and remains  fully functional today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More recently, Mr. Mizue successfully led the district through its biggest civil works construction program in many years with highly visible and vital projects, such as the $28 million Kaumalapau Harbor Project on the Island of Lanai, the $124 million Palau Compact Road Project in the Republic of Palau, and the $19 million Kikiaola Small Boat Harbor Project on the Island of Kauai. Under his tutelage, the Honolulu District has achieved the highest customer satisfaction rating for its civil works  program in its history. While these accomplishments attest to his commitment to client satisfaction, his nurturing, and pragmatic management style earned him a reputation as a solid team player and a supportive, fair supervisor and mentor to his staff. Mr. Mizue exemplifies not only an effective manager but, more importantly, a dedicated and caring leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Mizue is a recognized representative of the Corps in the Pacific Region. Under his management, the civil works and capital improvement programs expanded in Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, providing for the essential needs of these communities. Mr. Mizue's exemplary administrative and leadership skills have always led the way. He has established lasting relationships with the Hawaii congressional delegation, as well as the Governors of Hawaii, Guam,  American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands. The assets that he brings to bear on behalf of the Corps of Engineers are considerable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Tokyo, Japan and raised in California, Mr. Mizue is a registered professional engineer in California and Hawaii, a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, and a graduate of the CP-18 Executive Development Program. He holds a bachelors of science degree in engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles and a master of science degree in Water Resource Engineering from Utah State University. He received the Commander's Award for Civilian Service in 1993 and 2002. Mr.  Mizue is married to the former Ruby E. Ibaraki. They have three children, Evan, Reid, and Cara.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Mr. Mizue's lifelong contributions to the Army are considerable. His recognized leadership and management skills, his ability to forge lasting substantive relationships, and his clear direction and vision point to a truly outstanding individual who has dedicated his life to service. The Honolulu Engineer District will continue to serve as "America's Engineers in the Pacific." Paul Mizues's legacy of unwavering dedication to duty to the U.S. Army will carry on. Thank you, Mr.  Mizue for a job well done. You have the gratitude of a grateful nation.</paragraph>
