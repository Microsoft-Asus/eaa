    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Deanna Jensen, a lifelong Nevadan whose commitment to breast cancer advocacy will always be remembered. After her own long but heroic battle against breast cancer, she passed away on January 7. My thoughts and prayers are with Deanna's husband Don and her family as they mourn this great loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a loving wife and mother, cherished friend, and respected member of the community, Deanna touched many lives near and far. And my home State of Nevada was fortunate to have her from the beginning. Born in Elko and raised in Clover Valley on a cattle ranch, she graduated from Wells High School and eventually earned a master's degree in speech pathology-audiology at the University of Nevada, Reno. Deanna remained in Nevada, devoting herself to a career as a speech pathologist and working by  her husband's side at his business, Jensen Precast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When breast cancer finally struck, Deanna fought back and became a cancer survivor. In fact, before her recurrent metastatic breast cancer had returned for the final time, she had been cancer free for 5 years. In that time, Deanna had become a tireless activist for the cause of advancing breast cancer research. With a determination and persistence that would not surprise her loved ones, she sought to translate her private struggles with this terrible disease into civic action for the greater  good. It was clear to everyone that she cared deeply about the issue. "Why me?" was a question Deanna surely wondered about herself, but she wanted answers for all women who asked that question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The search for those answers is a driving force behind the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act, bipartisan legislation that Deanna sought to see enacted. While the devastating effects of breast cancer are all too evident, its causes are still mostly unknown. We do know that a better understanding of the links between the environment and breast cancer could help improve our knowledge of this complex illness. The Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act is designed to reveal those  links by making a truly meaningful research investment and charting a national research strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Deanna's words, that is why passing the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act is a real opportunity for Congress to "step up for women and breast cancer." Recognizing this call to action, 66 of my Senate colleagues and 262 members of the House of Representatives joined me in the 109th Congress in supporting the legislation. I hope that the new session of Congress will give us another opportunity to make good on our promise to finally pass the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In one of my last correspondences with Deanna, she wrote of her frustration that a bill with so much support had yet to be enacted by Congress. It was a fitting reminder of the way Deanna was mindful of the public sphere beyond her own immediate situation, even as she dealt with a grueling regimen of radiation and chemotherapy in her final moments. Her inner strength could not be extinguished then, nor will her contributions be forgotten now. She will be greatly missed.</paragraph>
