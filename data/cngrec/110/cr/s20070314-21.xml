    <paragraph>Mr. President, on March 2, 2007, the Boise Veterans Administration Medical Center bade farewell to its director of 14 years, Wayne Tippets. After a dedicated career with the VA spanning 37 years, Wayne retired with plans to travel and spend time with his family. I also understand that his retirement will likely include golfing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wayne served with the VA across the Nation, in places such as Iowa, Tennessee and California, before coming back to Idaho in 1993. He recognizes the importance of honesty, a strong work ethic, and the critical importance of competent, compassionate staff, and volunteers to the hospital's success. Wayne has handled the almost doubling of hospital patients over the past 14 years with a sense of pragmatism and drive to continue a history of responsible service to Idaho's veterans. Under his leadership,  the Boise VAMC rebuilt and modernized the medical/surgical ward; constructed a behavioral health center, outpatient care building, and specialty care clinic; opened a larger and modernized emergency room; opened a new building in Twin Falls; opened a new administration building; opened a community-based outpatient clinic in Caldwell; and established a patient care access point in Salmon, ID, offering social worker and telepsychiatry services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wayne was instrumental in these and other improvements and expansion of VA patient services throughout his tenure in Idaho. I wish him well in retirement and thank him for his long years of service to our Nation's veterans.</paragraph>
