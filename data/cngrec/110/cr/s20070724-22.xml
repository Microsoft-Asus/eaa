  <narrative>DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS -- (Senate - July 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9824">S9824</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have spoken to the two managers, Senators Byrd and Cochran. We have done some work this afternoon. We are getting a feel of the legislation. Senator Cantwell has an amendment she will offer at the appropriate time. Maybe it can be worked out with the managers. If it cannot, we certainly are not going to be able to debate it all tonight. We are working on the warrior legislation. If we decide to finish that tonight, that will be done by unanimous  consent and won't require a rollcall vote. At least it won't require one tonight. So I think that with a number of balls being up in the air--and we are waiting for other Senators to come and offer amendments--we will have no more rollcall votes tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest, though, that Senators should understand that tomorrow is Wednesday and we really need to finish this bill. I hope Senators who have amendments to offer will do that. I checked with the managers, and I have spoken with Senator Cochran. Tomorrow, if we are in a period where there are no amendments being offered, we will move to third reading. If people want to improve this bill in any way that they feel appropriate, the way to do it is to come and offer an amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have said today--and I say it again--I don't want to file cloture on the bill. I think it would set a pattern for how we need to work on appropriations bills. Let's get this done in the regular order. In fact, I said earlier today--and I will say it again--I have spoken to the President's Chief of Staff about appropriations bills generally. My feeling is that we will be happy to sit down and talk to the President's people about an overall program to get these bills passed. In the meantime,  let's do them one at a time. The power of the White House, whether it is a Democratic or a Republican President, comes when we have the conference, anyway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I hope we can work within the regular order to get this passed. I notify all Senate offices that there will be no more rollcall votes tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300076" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
