  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for testimony and representation in actions pending in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia. In these actions, anti-war protesters have been charged with unlawful assembly for refusing repeated requests to leave Senator MCCAIN's Washington, DC., office on or about February 5, 2007. Trials of these defendants are scheduled to commence on May 11, 2007. The prosecution has requested that a member of the Senator's staff  who had conversations with the defendants during the events in question testify in this case. Senator McCain would like to cooperate by providing testimony from his staff. This resolution would authorize that staff member, and any other employee of Senator MCCAIN's office from whom evidence may be required, to testify in this action, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel.</paragraph>
