    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an outstanding citizen of Buffalo and Western New York, John Michael Granville, an American diplomat who devoted his life to promoting peace through his humanitarian work in the continent of Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Granville worked for the United States Agency for International Development in Sudan. He was fatally shot on New Year's Day after attending a party at the British Embassy in Khartoum. His driver was also killed. His sudden passing is a great shock to all of us, and my thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this difficult time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this senseless tragedy, we lost a man of peace and purpose, a man who dedicated himself to serving people that most of us will never know in a place we will never visit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John's love for Africa, its culture, its people was nurtured during his years of service there. His most recent work involved distributing radios to people in the southern part of Sudan to support his agency's broadcasting initiative in the region which was recovering from 21 years of civil war. The goal was to prepare southern Sudan for elections in 2009 and a possible referendum on independence in 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before joining the United States Agency for International Development, John served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Cameroon where he helped build the first school in a rural village there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my capacity as a member of the Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs, I have traveled to Sudan. I have seen firsthand how important the work of peacemakers like John is to the people in these war-torn regions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John knew the dangers he faced, and he went anyway, with dignity and conviction. Such was his commitment to serve the people of Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Granville was a thoughtful and honorable man who was deeply loved by his family, friends and the community in my hometown of South Buffalo, New York. We are proud to salute John and honor him for his lasting service to our Nation and for the important humanitarian work that he was doing in Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John was a graduate of Canisius High School and Fordham University and earned a master's degree in international development from Clark University. A memorial scholarship has been established at Canisius High School in his memory as family, friends and classmates want to make sure that he is never forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know John will be missed beyond measure by his loving mother, Jane; his beloved sister, Katie; and brother-in-law, Sean; his loving nieces, Carolina, Julia, Hanna and Molly; and nephew, Matthew; his extended family and dear friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I take the liberty of honoring John's life and legacy by including the statement issued by his family shortly after his death, and it read's: "John's life was a celebration of love, hope and peace. He will be missed by many people throughout the world whose lives were touched and made better because of his care."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone who knew and was influenced by John will mourn his loss in their own way. I will do my part to honor John's memory by calling upon the administration to strengthen its efforts to protect American diplomats serving overseas and to help end the genocide in Darfur and to bring peace and reconciliation to the Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on this night, this solemn and peaceful night in our Nation's capital, a neighborhood grieves because a family from that neighborhood grieves. Our neighborhood and family grieve the loss of a young, courageous man of peace and reconciliation. And Mr. Speaker, as we have lost a great young man doing God's work, tonight our Nation grieves with them.</paragraph>
