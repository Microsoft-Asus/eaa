    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I acknowledge the contributions of a dedicated public servant, Joe Whitaker. Joe currently serves as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army, Installations and Housing. This makes Joe Whitaker the most senior career civilian official in the Army responsible for military installation issues such as the construction of new facilities and housing for our soldiers and their families. Joe Whitaker's service to the Army includes both military and civilian service,  and he is retiring as a member of the Senior Executive Service at the end of this month after a career of over 35 years of dedicated public service to the U.S. Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, I appreciate the challenges Joe Whitaker has faced over the past few years trying to modernize the facilities where our soldiers live and work. These challenges include: an Army at war; the 2005 round of base realignment and closures; the so-called modular conversion of the Army from a division-based force to a brigade-based force; and the relocation of thousands of Army personnel and dependents from Europe to the United States.  This would be a significant set of challenges to deal with even if they had occurred one after the other, but Joe Whitaker and the Army have had to address them simultaneously, and I commend him for the job he has done in meeting these challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Senator from the State of Hawaii, I have seen first hand the improvements in both military capability and quality of life that have taken place for the Army in Hawaii thanks to the efforts of Joe Whitaker and others in the executive and legislative branches. This includes the privatization and improvement of over 7,800 homes for Army families in Hawaii under the Residential Communities Initiative and the construction of facilities to stand up a Stryker Brigade Combat Team in Hawaii. Our  Army forces in Hawaii are better off because of Joe Whitaker's contributions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dedicated career civil servants like Joe Whitaker are so important to the work of the Army and other Federal agencies. They provide the continuity, background of knowledge and experience, and relationships that the political appointees representing any administration need to get things accomplished. This is even more true in the military, where effective command during the relatively brief tours of senior military leaders would not be possible without the expertise of career civil servants like  Joe Whitaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the members and staff of our committee have also known they could rely on Joe Whitaker as a candid, hard-working partner in our shared responsibility for providing for our men and women in uniform and their families. On behalf of the Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support and the entire Senate Armed Services Committee, I express our appreciation to Joe Whitaker for his contributions, and dedication to, the soldiers of the U.S. Army and his country, and I wish him success in  his future endeavors.</paragraph>
