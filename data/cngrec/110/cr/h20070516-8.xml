  <speaking speaker="412215" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the new Democratic House has been busy passing a wide range of measures to help our Nation's economy grow. Unfortunately, we are having a difficult time finding support from the White House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We began by increasing the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years. The bill was overwhelmingly supported by this House, and yet President Bush has already vetoed it once.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This House also voted to support the Employee Free Choice Act, which helps all Americans share in our Nation's economic growth by supporting the basic right of workers to choose their own representative. But the President has threatened a veto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congress also overwhelmingly supported a bill that invests in hiring 10,000 new science and math teachers so that we can better compete in the new global economy. Unfortunately, the Bush administration opposes this legislation in its current form.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the new Congress is passing legislation that will grow our economy. Now we just need support from the White House to make it a reality.</paragraph>
