  <narrative>DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION -- (Senate - September 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="8931">S8931</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I know the Senator from Michigan is maybe doing so, but as I understand it, there was objection raised to the consideration of a managers' amendment regarding, I guess, 100 amendments. One of those amendments is a proposal of Senator Shelby and I, along with a unanimous vote of our Banking Committee, after lengthy discussion. It was the Iran sanctions proposal, which took a lot of work and effort to put together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was a comprehensive package, widely endorsed across the country by organizations to give us the kind of leverage necessary for us to bring Iran to the negotiating table diplomatically to reduce the threat that their potential nuclear arsenal poses to us, our allies, the State of Israel and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the fact that the managers of this bill had included this amendment in their managers' package. It would be a great travesty, in my view, for us to leave here having the other body having adopted similar language. This is the one opportunity for this body to embrace an economic sanctions proposal which would give us tremendous leverage in our efforts to bring Iran to that table.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To lose that opportunity would be a serious loss of opportunity for this country. So, again, my dear friend from Virginia was here. Therefore, on behalf of those of us on the committee, unanimously, the Dodd-Shelby Iran sanctions divestment nonproliferation amendment to the DOD authorization bill, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding any agreement with respect to <bill type="s" number="3001">S. 3001</bill>, it be in order for the Senate to consider amendment No. 5572 and that the amendment be considered and agreed to and  the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object, and I will object, I wish to advise the Senator that the vote to take place right now is on final passage. It has been agreed to by unanimous consent. Prior thereto, the distinguished chairman raised the question of the package to which you refer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, personally, approved of putting in the amendment. It had been my hope, I say it is now no longer my hope, my disappointment, that that could not be achieved along with about 100 other amendments from both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So at this time I have to object and ask the Chair for regular order for the vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
