  <speaking speaker="400644" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to join with millions across our Nation who applaud the Supreme Court's recent decision to uphold the ban on partial-birth abortion. Partial-birth abortion is unrivaled in its gruesome brutality. There is no question it has caused the vicious destruction of viable, living, breathing babies whose only crime is inconvenience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The court's decision is a victory in the quest to restore the dignity of human life. No longer will the most vulnerable and innocent among us be subject to such cruelty as partial-birth abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also a victory for the Constitution, Mr. Speaker, which liberal activist judges have demeaned for far too long. It is encouraging to see the court's decision move towards our Founders' vision, a vision rooted in the commitment to not only protect, but to also respect human life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this is a step forward, it is only one victory in the longer struggle to assure that the abolition of abortion altogether is achieved. Let us never forget our responsibility to hold the basic sanctity granted to us by our Maker.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
