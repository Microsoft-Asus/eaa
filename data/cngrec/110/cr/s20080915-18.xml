  <narrative>HONORING SOJOURNER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -- (Senate - September 15, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="8527">S8527</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the exceptional educators at Sojourner Elementary School of Milwaukie, OR. Last week, Intel Corporation named Sojourner the "Star Innovator" among six winners of the 2008 Intel Schools of Distinction Awards and among hundreds of applicants who entered the competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Intel Corporation chose Sojourner Elementary because of its groundbreaking teaching strategies in mathematics and the marked improvement of its young math students. Oregon State Assessment data indicate that mathematics achievement at Sojourner has steadily improved over the past 4 years. Sojourner uses an innovative "team teaching" approach. At each level, at least one teacher completes additional coursework and training in mathematics. This ongoing professional development has resulted in  teachers specializing in content and academic knowledge in mathematics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increasingly, technology is playing an important role in the classroom, and teachers at Sojourner are using it effectively to excite and engage students. Computers at Sojourner are equipped with the software necessary to complete computer-based units from the school's math curriculum, and teachers are trained to implement these units. With Intel's Star Innovator award, Sojourner Elementary will receive additional funds, products, and services to continue its unique program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sojourner also involves parents in the learning process, a proven strategy for improving the performance of young students. Newsletters produced at each level inform parents as to the  specific content in class so that parents can provide appropriate support at home. All families have math "kits" at home so that students can continue to develop ideas at the conceptual level. Families also have access to the district Web site, where the online Student  Learning Center provides valuable resources for practice activities at a variety of levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the field of education, there is no single path to success. That is why it is important to highlight those programs like Sojourner's that are successful and reward their efforts. Intel's work in promoting mathematics and science education comes at a critical time when America needs more engineers and more mathematicians to stay competitive in a globalizing economy. I am grateful to the teachers at Sojourner Elementary who have worked so hard to set a new standard in math education and that  Intel has taken on the responsibility of awarding these remarkable achievements. Our Nation benefits tremendously from sharing these best practices, and I am proud to honor the exceptional work that Sojourner Elementary is doing to educate our Nation's children and the future leaders of America.</paragraph>
