  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO LAVENIA McCOY</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, when Lavenia McCoy arrived in Bayfield in 1939 as new teacher, she also went to the library to volunteer. She has served that library continuously: from the small space behind the post office, to the town hall on the east side of the post office, to the entire 1100-square-foot building at the corner of Mill and Pearl Streets, to the new 8200-square-foot library on the north side of town.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lavenia McCoy was the first person in Bayfield to catalog books by the Dewey Decimal System, a change for the alphabetical order by author's last name of the 500 or so books. She began serving on the Library Board in 1948, at the behest of Betty Stock, as secretary. About 35 years later, Lavenia McCoy became treasurer, including keeping the library's financial records; she did that until 2006. By then the budget had increased from pennies for overdue fees to several million dollars, the staff  from all volunteer to six paid librarians, the circulation from a few shelves of books to 20,000 volumes, and the financial records from ledger to computer. Always she encouraged folks to use their library.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lavenia McCoy is a lifelong library user, and she is one who is willing to do the work in order to enjoy the privilege. In 2005, the Library Board named its new library "Lavenia McCoy Public Library" in recognition of her contribution. I wanted to take a moment to congratulate her and her service.</paragraph>
