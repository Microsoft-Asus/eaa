  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - September 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="8963">S8963</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, following the remarks of the two leaders, the Senate will proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators allowed to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been in contact with the Republican leader. We hope, in the near future, to be able to enter a unanimous consent agreement to move forward on the tax extenders legislation, with limited debate. We also were unable to reach an agreement to consider the Advance America's Priorities Act. I am expecting a call from Senator Coburn momentarily to see if we can work our way through that. If we are unable to reach an agreement today on the extenders package--and we certainly think it  would be possible, with an agreement, to work through the Coburn problems, but if we cannot do that, we will have to have a cloture vote in the morning on <bill type="s" number="3297">S. 3297</bill>. I hope that is not necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remind everybody that the adjournment date is next Friday. Everyone who holds things up must be very careful that they are not holding up our getting out of here on time. We have to do the extenders. We have to do the energy legislation. We have to do work on the stimulus bill, a CR, and a few other things that are absolutely necessary. I have spoken to the House leadership, and they want to be out by next Friday. But we have to send them some things before we can be out by next Friday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remind everyone that it is possible that we might have to work the next few days. There is nothing to change that at this stage. Monday, there will be no votes. I announced that some time ago. That being the case, whatever we do this week, then we have next Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and that is our adjournment date. If we don't finish our work by next Friday--or Saturday, if that is the case--the following week is a Jewish holiday, Rosh Hashanah, which means we would have to  come back the following Wednesday. So I hope everybody understands how difficult this is. One of the Senators said to me: Why aren't you more definite in what you are scheduling? I just cannot be, with the procedures in the Senate. One or two people can really throw a monkey wrench into how we move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we can have a very productive day. It is possible that we can complete the tax extenders and the energy legislation today. We could do that all today. There is no reason we can't. We know what we need to do. We need to pass the paid-for extenders on energy. We need to have a vote on AMT, whether we are going to pay for that, and we need to have a vote on the rest of the extenders package. Time limits are in  the proposed unanimous consent agreement.  We can do that quickly, and we can then move to have the votes on the energy package. Senator Bingaman has an amendment. We have a House bill. We could move to substitute the Bingaman amendment for that. The Republicans have something they want to do on drilling. And then we will see if there is going to be the alternative offered</paragraph>
