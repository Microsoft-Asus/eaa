  <narrative>RESPONSE NEEDED REGARDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN MILITARY -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H29]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to associate myself with the remarks that my colleagues have made on the existence of an economic crisis and to ask this administration to wake up. I hope that we will do something to deal with the catastrophic subprime mortgage collapse, and that is to call for a moratorium on all foreclosures across America, those individuals who are behind in their payments and those who are in fact keeping up with their payments. Some response has to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I do want to step aside from the economic engine and the need for that to cite a situation that I think is drastic and, of course, a disaster, and that is the tragedy of the young marine, the young woman, who has now lost her  life in North Carolina, and to ask the United States military what happens when a woman alleges sexual harassment, or, in this instance, rape. I think it is imperative that we have a system and a response that was not given to  this young woman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some years ago, the Women's Caucus, Republicans and Democrats, raised the question of sexual harassment that was permeating our United States military. They are too good for this and this must stop. I am saddened by her loss. I believe it could have been avoided. We need a response, and we need it now.</paragraph>
