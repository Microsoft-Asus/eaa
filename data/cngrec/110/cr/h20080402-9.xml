  <narrative>DEMOCRATS WANT TO WORK WITH REPUBLICANS TO HELP AMERICAN FAMILIES -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1892]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American public is rightfully concerned about the future of our Nation's economy. Stagnant wages were already making it difficult for families to afford rising gas, home heating, grocery, and health care bills. Now, there is the added worry of losing their homes. The housing crisis could lead to more than 2 million homeowners losing their homes in the near future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, we address some of the housing concerns in the bipartisan economic stimulus plan. In that package, we expanded affordable mortgage loan opportunities through the Federal Housing Administration, and expanded financial counseling for families who are at risk of losing their homes. This was a good start, but more needs to be done. As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, I look forward to working with Chairman Frank to move through the committee his foreclosure  prevention package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in the coming weeks I hope that we can once again come together as Republicans and Democrats in this important legislation.</paragraph>
