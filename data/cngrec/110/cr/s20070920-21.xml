    <paragraph>Mr. President, on Wednesday, September 5, 2007, the State of Nevada and our Nation lost a true hero: Retired U.S. Army Air Corp LTC George Sherman., who served our Nation during World War II as a member of the famed Tuskegee Airmen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like so many African-American soldiers during that time, Colonel Sherman answered the call to fight for freedom and justice abroad, even when it was categorically denied at home. These men traveled and fought thousands of miles from their families--when every day, their mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers faced injustice at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While our Nation can never fully repay the debt to our veterans, in March of this year Congress officially thanked Colonel Sherman and his fellow Tuskegee Airmen for their service to our Nation. Colonel Sherman joined nearly 300 other Tuskegee Airmen in the Capitol Rotunda as thousands watched President Bush and leaders from the House and Senate award them the Congressional Gold Medal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colonel Sherman and the Tuskagee Airmen were in prestigious company in receiving the highest honor our Nation can bestow upon private citizens. Other honorees include individuals such President Harry Truman, Jackie Robinson, Reverend Billy Graham, Rosa Parks, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was pleased to have the opportunity to watch Colonel Sherman and his fellow Tuskegee Airmen proudly take their place among all American heroes. Yet in addition to their accomplishments as Tuskegee Airmen, Colonel Sherman and many others continued to serve their country and local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colonel Sherman had a long record of service to Nevada. After 22 years of military service, he made his home in Las Vegas. Colonel Sherman was a tireless supporter of the Boy Scouts of America, where he earned the highest  honor of the Silver Beaver Award. He was active in the Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, which supports achievement in every field of human endeavor. Colonel Sherman also served on the board of directors of the Nevada Black Chamber of Commerce.  And he continued to inspire young people to pursue opportunities in aviation though numerous speaking engagements across southern Nevada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, Mr. President, we have lost a true hero. Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones.</paragraph>
