Chaplain Wilson is a 21-year veteran of the United States Border Patrol currently assigned to the Family Support Unit in El Paso, Texas. The Family Support Unit is a 1-year pilot program intended to provide Border Patrol agents, staff and their families with a support network to help manage times of crisis. During his early years in the Border Patrol, Chaplain Wilson served as a program manager under my command  as Sector Chief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chaplain Wilson is married to San Juanita Wilson who today are celebrating their 27th wedding anniversary. Together they have four children: Alicia; Marty, Jr.; Stephanie; and Daisy. Marty, Jr. recently followed in his father's footsteps, becoming the second in his family to join the United States Border Patrol.</paragraph>
