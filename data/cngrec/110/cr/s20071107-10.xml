  <narrative>LABOR-HHS CONFERENCE REPORT -- (Senate - November 07, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14027">S14027</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Now on to the discussion about the legislation, the conference report. This bill does not contain excessive funding. What we are looking at is a bill which has a cost-of-living adjustment to what the figure was last year. The President has come in with a figure which is $3 billion less than last year. When you add the cost of living adjustment, and some very modest increases in very important programs, this is a modest bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Institutes of Health, which have been increased under the stewardship of Senator Harkin and myself, has been increased from 12, now to $30 billion. Last year it was $29 billion. The extra billion dollars does not even keep up with inflation costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have mine safety, which is a major item. It was pared back as much as can be done consistent with the mine accidents most recently in Utah.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Community health centers are still underfunded. Community health services, as has been noted by the President, are very important programs. GEAR UP, a program to deal with at-risk youth, very modestly financed. Very important to my State, Pennsylvania, and Philadelphia, which had 406 homicides last year and a real effort to add mentoring to try to take at-risk youth and try to deal with this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope we can negotiate with the President and come to an acceptable term. The President has stated his willingness to negotiate on SCHIP where there is a significant difference between what the President wants and what the Congress has legislated. As the facts suggest negotiations ought to be undertaken on SCHIP, they do as well on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my suggestion these bills not be considered together. They violate the rules in their joinder. There will be a point of order raised, and I believe they ought to be separated in accordance with regular Senate rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we combine the Veterans bill with the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education bill, we have already been advised there will be a veto of both bills. The veterans financing is too important to be delayed. I chaired the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for some 6 years. The additional funds are necessary, and there would be undue delay if they are joined together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it would be my hope they will be separated so the veterans funding can go forward, and we can send this bill to the President with a view to negotiating terms. I have been in touch with the White House, talking about the possibility of coming to an agreed settlement so we can move the appropriations process forward and serve the needs of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <chair> The Republican leader.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
