    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to briefly say how proud I am that this amendment has been worked out, and I express my appreciation, both to the senior Senator from Virginia for having helped us work this out and also to my colleague from Missouri who did such a great job on the floor yesterday, managing the bill. I yield the rest of our time to the Senator from Missouri.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, "We intend to see that no man or corporate group shall profit inordinately on the blood of the boys in the foxhole."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what Senator Harry Truman said as the Truman committee began its work. I think Harry Truman would be very proud of the Senate tonight. I, too, thank the senior Senator from Virginia for his willingness to sit down and work this out, along with Senator Levin for all of his support. I think this commission can do important work in a bipartisan way to fix some problems, to make sure we get contracting under control whenever our men and women are in danger.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me add my commendation to Senators WEBB and MCCASKILL and the others who fought so hard for this amendment. The heart of this amendment has remained. There have been some changes in it. But the substance of this amendment, the crying need for a commission to look into the contract abuses and waste and fraud is very strong. This amendment is going to do some important work for the country and for the next time we are in a situation where we have such  massive spending as we have in this war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--I have cleared this with my friend, Senator Warner--that we vitiate the vote on the Menendez amendment--that has been done? Fine.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that we may have printed in the Record at this point such other statements relative to the changes that we deem appropriate to support this amendment, including a document dated September 25, 2007, by the Deputy Secretary of Defense subject: "Management of DOD Contractors and Contract Personnel Accompanying U.S. Armed Forces in Contingency Operations Outside the United States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a step by the Deputy Secretary to correct some of the problems that this commission will be addressing. It underlies the necessity for the commission that these two Senators and others have advocated.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>THE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, September 25, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>Management of DoD Contractors and Contractor Personnel Accompanying U.S. Armed Forces in Contingency Operations Outside the United States</narrative>
  <narrative>Defense contractors fulfill a variety of important functions for the Department of Defense, both inside the United States and abroad. These functions encompass vital support to our military forces engaged in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to include security for convoys, sites, personnel and the like.</narrative>
  <narrative>While investigations are still ongoing and no findings of wrongdoing determined, recent events regarding non-DoD contractors performing security service in Iraq have identified a need to better ensure that relevant DoD policies and processes are being followed. This review is applicable for all policies and processes to manage DoD contractors accompanying U.S. armed forces in contingency operations outside the United States. DoDI 3020.41, "Contractor Personnel Authorized to Accompany the U.S.  Armed Forces," is the comprehensive source of policy and procedures concerning DoD contractor personnel.</narrative>
  <narrative>Geographic Combatant Commanders are responsible for establishing lines of command responsibility within their Area of Responsibility (AOR) for oversight and management of DoD contractors and for discipline of DoD contractor personnel when appropriate. Accordingly, addressees will ensure the consistency of their implementing guidance for policies outlined in DoDI 3020.41 and ensure contracts being executed within an AOR require DoD contractors to comply with the respective geographic Combatant  Commander's guidance for the AOR including, for example, Rules on the Use of Force (RUF).</narrative>
  <narrative>DoD contractor personnel (regardless of nationality) accompanying U.S. armed forces in contingency operations are currently subject to UCMJ jurisdiction. Commanders have UCMJ authority to disarm, apprehend, and detain DoD contractors suspected of having committed a felony offense in violation of the RUF, or outside the scope of their authorized mission, and to conduct the basic UCMJ pretrial process and trial procedures currently applicable to the courts-martial of military servicemembers. Commanders  also have available to them contract and administrative remedies, and other remedies, including discipline and possible criminal prosecution.</narrative>
  <narrative>Under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA), federal jurisdiction exists over felony offenses committed outside the U.S. by contractor personnel of any federal agency or provisional authority whose employment relates to supporting the DoD mission. Implementing guidance under this Act is included in DoDI 5525.11, "Criminal Jurisdiction Over Civilians Employed by or Accompanying the Armed Forces Outside the United States, Certain Service Members, and Former Service Members," and  military department regulations. This instruction requires DoD coordination with the Department of Justice for the return to the U.S. of contractor personnel subject to MEJA for prosecution.</narrative>
  <narrative>Pursuant to these authorities, addressees as appropriate will:</narrative>
  <narrative>1. Ensure that all required clauses are included in DoD contracts when contract performance requires contractors and contractor personnel to accompany U.S. forces in contingency operations.</narrative>
  <narrative>2. Verify that all DoD contractors ensure that their personnel authorized to carry weapons as security personnel or for personal protection have been properly trained and licensed for the weapons they are authorized to carry and appropriately trained on the applicable RUF.</narrative>
  <narrative>3. Provide appropriate discipline for unauthorized possession, carrying, or discharging weapons.</narrative>
  <narrative>4. Ensure that instructions have been issued to their command and to their contractors to prevent contractor personnel who are suspected of having committed a felony act or of having committed an act in violation of the RUF from being allowed to leave the country until approved by the senior commander in the country or until an investigation is completed and a decision is rendered by the flag officer court martial convening authority. Officials of contracting firms who arrange for, facilitate,  or allow such personnel to leave the country before being cleared will be subject to disciplinary action under either UCMJ or MEJA.</narrative>
  <narrative>5. Review periodically the existing RUF and make any changes necessary to minimize the risk of innocent civilian casualties or unnecessary destruction of civilian property.</narrative>
  <narrative>6. Require DoD contractors performing security services to provide to the Combatant Commander copies of their Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and guidance to their contractor personnel on escalation of the use of force, the use of deadly force, and on the rules for interaction with host country nationals who may be present and/or potentially involved in a situation perceived by contractor personnel as a potential threat to their mission or to themselves. Require that such SOPs and guidance  be modified as necessary to be consistent with the RUF.</narrative>
  <narrative>7. Review periodically the guidance and authorization for DoD contractor personnel to possess and carry weapons.</narrative>
  <narrative>Over the past several months, the Department has been developing and staffing additional guidance regarding this UCMJ disciplinary authority over persons serving with or accompanying the armed forces during contingency operations. The UCMJ authority referenced in this memorandum remains in effect until modified by promulgation of such additional guidance.</narrative>

  <chair> Under the previous order, the amendment has been agreed to.</chair>

  <narrative>The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.</narrative>
  <chair> The next question is on amendment No. 2196, offered by Senator Coburn. Ten minutes will be evenly divided.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. We voted to increase the debt limit. We have a project that the Department of Justice, the DEA, and all the other drug enforcement agencies say is ineffective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to give you some quotes from the people who worked there and what they had said. Former official of the Drug Czar's office put it bluntly: "We see nothing from this."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The former, most recently resigned, Director: "I recognize that many of the reports were god-awful, poorly written, poorly researched, and in many cases just plain wrong."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim Milford, former NDIC Deputy, admitted: "I have never come to terms with the justification for the NDIC, and the bottom line is we actually have to search for a mission."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are good people who work there. It is not about them. It is about whether we are going to be prudent with the money we spend. They have one program that is effective. It is called DOCX. The problem with it being where it is, is it cannot be applied there, it has to be applied at other drug intelligence centers and the other DEA centers throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration, the Department of Justice, the DEA and all the other drug centers, especially the one in El Paso, is where this information ought to be processed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have spent half a billion dollars and gotten very little return. It is a recommendation that we have a chance to do something. We have a chance to eliminate a program that is not effective by any metric that the Government has applied or the former Directors have applied or the Deputy Directors have applied who have worked there, saying it is not effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hope is this body will approve this amendment and start us down the road of eliminating programs that are ineffective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the remainder of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Michigan.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will yield half the time in opposition to the Coburn amendment to the two Senators from Pennsylvania, half to Senator Specter and half to Senator Casey.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, will you advise me when the 2 1/2  minutes have expired?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Yes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, contrary to the arguments of the Senator from Oklahoma, the National Drug Intelligence Center has been functioning since 1993 and has never been challenged on this floor in any respect. It has not been challenged until today because it has performed so well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday I had printed in the Record the extensive compliments  which have been paid by the FBI in an expansive letter on November 21, 2001, by DEA, the Drug Enforcement Agency; on June 21, 2006, by FBI field offices around the country, including Tampa, Detroit, and Charlotte, by U.S. attorneys around the country. It has performed with very strategic results. It is important to decentralize operations such as the National Drug Intelligence  Center. Everything does not have to be in Washington. It costs about a third to do it in Johnstown as it would in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Senator from Oklahoma says it ought to be in El Paso because all the drugs come from El Paso, that is simply not true. Drugs come into this country from Miami, from New York, from Detroit, from California. They come from everywhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been in existence for 14 years and is functioning successfully. It is not a minor matter that it has 340 jobs. Johnstown has become accustomed to having this. Johnstown, as is well known historically, has had its tough time with two major floods. It doesn't deserve another flood by having this body saying the office ought to be removed at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to my distinguished colleague from Scranton, PA.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="">
    <paragraph>I wish to reiterate much of what Senator Specter already said. This center is providing important law enforcement services right now, helping out on international drug trafficking, which helps out in the fight against terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we came to this floor every week and talked about what some Government agency said about a particular facility such as this, we would be having these votes all the time. I was the auditor of Pennsylvania. I know a lot about waste, fraud, and abuse. I know how to find it and root it out. But I also know you cannot take one Government agency's word for it. This center is providing an important service right now, in crime fighting, in keeping local law enforcement working with the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an important facility in the State of Pennsylvania. There are people there who are working hard in Johnstown, PA. This is a diversion from some other things we have been doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is very important that we support this kind of facility. All the answers do not reside in Washington, DC. There are some people out there who know how to fight crime, some people out there who know how to root out and crack down on drug trafficking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This center plays that role. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> There are 3 minutes 11 seconds.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>What you did not hear is what is the mission of the NDIC. It has no mission. That is the problem. The agency running this center says it should be closed--for very good reasons. It does not have an international mandate. They have had people fired because they are doing things that are outside of what restricted mission they have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The one program that works is DOSX, and those people who are functioning with DOSX have to go to wherever the information is, which they are extracting in the investigation. None of that is done in Johnstown. So if they travel, it doesn't matter where they start.</paragraph>

  <chair> Under the previous order, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.</chair>
  <narrative>The legislative clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Cloture Motion</narrative>
  <narrative>We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the  Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending substitute amendment to Calendar No. 189, <bill type="h" number="1585">H.R. 1585</bill>, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008.</narrative>
  <chair> By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call is waived.</chair>
  <chair>The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on Amendment No. 2011, offered by the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, in the nature of a substitute to <bill type="h" number="1585">H.R. 1585</bill>, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, shall be brought to a close?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, just 30 seconds. I hope the Senate will vote for cloture. Let me give the rundown of amendments we have now adopted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One hundred ninety-one amendments have now been adopted through either clearance in voice vote or rollcall. We have a lot of amendments left. We will be here tomorrow, and we will be here on Monday. If cloture is invoked, we will work the best we can to see if we can get some germane amendments adopted, even those that we agree by unanimous consent may not be germane but should be adopted. I hope cloture is invoked. We will be here tomorrow and Monday to work on amendments.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I support many of the priorities in this bill, and I do not think the Senate should extend debate on it indefinitely. But, if we invoke cloture on the bill, as it currently stands, we will be ensuring that it contains no language to bring our involvement in the Iraq war to a close. That would be a mistake. The war in Iraq is taking a tremendous toll on our servicemembers and our military preparedness--not to mention our national security and our pocketbook. It is  irresponsible for Congress to pass legislation authorizing the activities of the Department of Defense that fails to bring our troops home and this war to an end.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are now on the bill in a postcloture status. The distinguished chairman, Senator Levin, is here. I am here. We are prepared to deal with whatever amendments come forward this evening and, again, we will be here tomorrow.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Maryland.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the Kennedy-Mikulski amendment, as amended by the distinguished majority leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know the hour is late so I will not speak at length, but I will speak with passion about what this amendment is all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is about contracting out. I am here to join in an amendment that protects our Civil Service, protects our taxpayers, and protects Government workers. I think we would all agree that America needs an independent Civil Service and that our Federal employees are on the front lines every day working hard for America. This administration's plan for privatization is a quota-driven plan that costs money, morale, and the integrity of the Civil Service. It forces Federal employees into unfair competition  and forces them to spend time and money competing for their jobs instead of doing their jobs. The administration has stacked the deck against Federal employees with their A-76 competitions, but I am here to level the playing field along with my colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is simple. It helps Federal employees compete for their jobs and at the same time, makes sure  the Federal Government saves money. My other colleagues who are cosponsors will focus on different pieces of this amendment, but I am here to talk about three specific parts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, this amendment saves taxpayers money. When the administration passed these new quota-driven bounty-hunting A-76 rules, contractors were not even required to show they would save the Government any money--but we thought that was the point of it--so we had some private contracts that actually cost the Government more money than if Federal employees were doing the work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the amendment that is pending would require that all contracts save $10 million or 10 percent. You must save money: $10 million or 10 percent. So Federal workers will not be losing their jobs to contractor bids that do not even save the Government or the taxpayers money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, it deals with the issue of health and retirement benefits. Right now, a private contractor can win a bid on Federal work simply because they provide either no health and retirement benefits or skimpy or Spartan benefits, this is bad for Federal employees and bad for the contractors doing the work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would prohibit contractors from winning a bid if the only cost savings are from bad or no benefits. This is to prevent bagging benefits in order to win the contract. This helps level the playing field for Federal employees who have to submit their own best bids, but they have to include these health and retiree benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number 3, really, this is what I think is crucial, and I hope my colleagues from the other side of the aisle will hear this. This amendment eliminates privatization quotas. Remember, the new Bush rules are quota driven. It makes those who are pushing the A-76 in an agency the equivalent of a bounty hunter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, let's deal with the word "quota." I have heard a lot about quotas in my day, usually from the other side in a very pejorative way. Hey, what happened to goals and timetables? I thought we did not go for quotas in this Senate. I thought we were for goals and timetables. Remember discussions on affirmative action? "We don't want no quotas." Well, I do not want quotas in privatization. Quite frankly, I do not even want goals and timetables in privatization. But OMB imposes privatization  quotas on all Federal agencies, forcing them to conduct A-76 competitions on as many as 150,000 jobs each year. What a huge waste of money. These quota-driven bounty hunters force these wasteful A-76 reviews, even on agencies that do not want to do them or in categories that give them pause to pursue. It wastes time. It wastes taxpayers' dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would stop OMB from using quotas to force agencies to conduct these privatization reviews. This would not prevent agencies from contracting out work. It would simply allow Federal agencies to make their own decisions about when to use the A-76 process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now let me be very clear. I am not opposed to contracting out. I am not opposed to privatization. In my own State it has worked well. Look at Goddard Space Flight Center. We have 3,000 civil service jobs, but 9,000 private contractor jobs. In this way, we get incredible value for our space dollar. I am proud of them both, and they work well together. They serve the Nation well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the way this administration is going about privatization does not work. We need this amendment because the way contracting is being pursued is irresponsible. It even puts our Nation's security at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to give one specific issue--contracting out at Walter Reed. Before my dear colleague Senator Paul Sarbanes left, we were on this floor fighting an A-76 contract for contracting out facilities management for people who handle the grounds and so on at Walter Reed. We challenged that A-76 because there had been over three to six appeals. Each time the Federal employees won. However, the administration pushed and pushed and pushed. As we were battling it out on the floor, I read a letter from  the colonel who said: If you contract this out, I am concerned there will be a degradation of service at Walter Reed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well--guess what--we lost the amendment. Walter Reed contracted out its facilities management. We went from 300 employees, who kept Walter Reed tip top for our wounded warriors, down to 50 people, and we ended up with a national scandal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, you tell me, what did we gain from that contracting out? How could you look in the eyes of a wounded warrior at Walter Reed and at a hospital that was ridden with mold and rot, for which we all had to go out and pound on the table and pound on our chest about the outrage? We could have stopped the scandal at Walter Reed if we had stopped that contracting out--300 people to 50. Why did it take 300 people at Walter Reed? Because it is an older building. It is several buildings. Our wounded  warriors were in hospitals that made international headlines because we could not take care of our own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I am now taking care of this contracting out. So this amendment is the "remember the Walter Reed scandal" amendment. I hope my colleagues will join with me. Yes, we will privatize where appropriate. Yes, we will privatize where we will get value for our dollar. But I don't want any kind of privatization that ends up in a national scandal and a national disgrace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the threat posed by Iran, but I voted against the amendment offered by Senators KYL and LIEBERMAN because it could be interpreted as an authorization to keep U.S. troops in Iraq indefinitely to police the Iraqi civil war and engage in a proxy war with Iran. Maintaining a significant U.S. troop presence in Iraq is undermining our ability to deter Iran as it increases its influence in Iraq, becomes bolder in its nuclear aspirations,  and continues to support Hezbollah. The administration needs to end its myopic focus on Iraq and develop comprehensive, effective strategies for dealing with Iran and the other serious challenges we face around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I voted against Senator Biden's amendment because, while we should support a comprehensive political settlement in Iraq, the U.S. Government shouldn't tell the Iraqi people how to run their country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor Senator Biden's amendment calling on the United States to actively support a Federal system of government in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The brutal reality is that Iraq today is being torn apart by sectarian violence. The Maliki government in Baghdad is too weak and too corrupt to lead Iraq's Sunni, Shia and Kurdish communities to the political reconciliation they need to end the fighting. Iraq is being torn apart by civil war, and U.S. military forces are caught in the middle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear to me that President Bush has no strategy for ending the war in Iraq. It is up to Congress to provide the way forward to bring stability to Iraq and to bring our troops home. Our military has done everything we have asked them to do, valiantly and skillfully. But the experts all agree: there is no military solution in Iraq. We need a comprehensive political settlement that gives the Iraqi people control over their own fate and allows our troops to come home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Biden has proposed a plan to maintain a united Iraq by decentralizing it. Rather than putting our troops between warring factions, this plan would give the Kurds, Sunni and Shia control over their own land and people, while leaving a central government in Baghdad responsible for protecting common national Iraqi interests. This plan has five major parts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Step one is establishing three autonomous regions in Iraq with a functional central government in Baghdad. Each region would have authority over its own domestic laws, administration, and internal security. The central government would control border defense, foreign policy, and oil revenues. This would give Iraq's sectarian groups control over their own destiny and ensure that Iraq does not splinter into pieces, creating regional chaos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Step two of the Biden plan is to secure the cooperation of Iraq's Sunni minority. The Sunni Arabs in Iraq do not have access to the same oil wealth enjoyed by the Kurds in the north and the Shia in the south. Under this plan, Iraq's central Government would guarantee the Sunni's economic viability  by pledging 20-percent of Iraq's oil revenue. It would address Sunni political concerns by allowing former members of the Baath party to join Iraq's national  Government. Iraq's Sunnis must have confidence that they can prosper and thrive in a peaceful Iraq, so they will lay down their arms and end their destructive insurgency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Step three of this plan is to call on the international community and Iraq's neighbors to help stabilize Iraq by accepting this federal arrangement and respecting Iraq's borders and sovereignty. Iraq will need strong support from the international community to ensure that its neighbors do not try to expand their influence into any of the three autonomous regions created under this federalist system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Step four calls for the withdrawal of most U.S. military forces from Iraq. We would leave a small but effective residual force behind to help Iraq's security forces combat terrorism and protect Iraq's borders, but most U.S. forces would be out of Iraq before the end of 2008. We know there is no military solution to Iraq's current problems, and we know the armed militias that are tearing Iraq apart will never lay down their arms as long as the U.S. military has a large presence in their country.  Withdrawing most U.S. troops will demonstrate to the Iraqi people that they must take responsibility for building a peaceful, stable Iraq. A small but lethal contingent of U.S. forces that remains either in Iraq or nearby can help the Iraqis combat terrorism and deter mischief by Iraq's neighbors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the Biden plan calls for robust international support for reconstruction in Iraq. This economic assistance must be conditioned on respect for minority and women's rights. The international community has an interest in seeing a vital, healthy Iraq, but we should use our resources to help Iraq build a society based on equality for all. By providing economic opportunities for every Iraqi, we can help end the violence and build a strong, stable Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that President Bush has no plan for stabilizing Iraq or ending the war. The Biden plan can lead to a lasting political solution in Iraq that stops the violence and allows our military forces to come home. I am proud to support it, and I am proud to cosponsor this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to take a moment to inform the Senate about amendment No. 2981. I greatly appreciate Chairman Levin's and Ranking Member McCain's cooperation in including it in the managers' package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment to the Defense authorization bill calls for a review of the Department of Energy's strategic plan for advanced computing. This review would be completed by the independent scientific advisory group and assess where the Department is headed in this important area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure focuses attention on the essential role our national laboratories play in advancing the state of the art for high performance computing a vital area for our national security and scientific leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our laboratories have been instrumental in pressing the limits of raw computing power and creating more sophisticated simulation capabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the early days of scientific computing and continuing through the development of today's advanced parallel computing systems, the laboratories pioneered the development of high performance computing and software development. From developing advanced computing architectures and algorithms to effective means for storing and viewing the enormous amounts of data generated by these machines, the laboratories have made high performance computing a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These capabilities have become a requirement for certifying the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile without nuclear testing. They also find application far outside laboratory walls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Stockpile Stewardship Program was created as the alternative to underground nuclear testing, to ensure that our nuclear weapons systems would remain safe, secure and reliable. Doing so without nuclear testing required significant investments in computer modeling and simulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This investment has paid enormous dividends. Every year, computing power increases at a pace set by America's national laboratories. The world's current fastest supercomputer is Lawrence Livermore's "Blue Gene," which recently exceeded 280 "teraflops" or trillions of calculations per second. Oak Ridge's "Jaguar" system and Sandia National Laboratory's "Red Storm" are second and third, each exceeding 100 teraflops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The applications go well beyond security and basic science. The laboratories have worked hard to transition these capabilities to academia and industry, simulating complex industrial processes and their environmental impact including global climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Collaborations with the private sector have also driven down the cost, so that now high performance does not mean high expense. This has had an enormous impact, making advanced computing within the reach of an ever wider circle of users including the Department of Energy's Office of Science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the labs today, not only do these computers run advanced experimental models that give us confidence in our nuclear deterrent, but they also help us decipher the human genome and develop improved medicines. Advanced computing has also helped Sandia engineers understand the safety risks to the Space Shuttle, when the foam from the fuel tank hit and damaged the heat tiles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will continue to use advanced computing to support engineering design work to ensure that our bridges and infrastructure are safe, as well as filter massive amounts of data in an effort to predict where terrorists are planning to attack next.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These achievements did not happen by accident. They required planning, commitment and follow through.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, I am concerned that we may be losing this focus and commitment to support long term research on advance computing architectures and continue the search for even greater simulation capabilities. The Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration appear not to have a coordinated strategy for advancing the state-of-the-art in computing and instead propose to actually reduce computing capacity within the laboratory system. I believe this is a mistake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Senate Energy and Water Development appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008, Chairman Dorgan and I have proposed to establish a joint program office for high performance computing led by the NNSA Administrator and the Under Secretary for Science. This office will have the primary responsibility of ensuring a well balanced portfolio of computing platforms for the DOE and the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposed office will develop a high performance computing technology roadmap and acquisition strategy for the DOE. I strongly believe that DOE and NNSA must pool their resources and establish an advanced computing R&amp;D program. A long term, Department-wide strategy is necessary to ensure that the world class simulation capabilities within the complex are maintained and investments are made to drive innovation. If the past success of the program is a predictor, there will be amazing new technological  innovations and the cost of computing will fall like a stone. This will ensure that universities, laboratories, U.S. businesses and law enforcement will have the computing capability necessary for their success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must continue to raise the bar, giving our best and brightest new targets to aim for, ensuring that America will retain its technical leadership in advanced computing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to pay tribute to the men and women of Sandia, Los Alamos and Livermore National labs and their private sector counterparts at Cray, IBM, and Intel, and the Department of Energy and the NNSA. These individuals have worked extraordinarily hard to solve complex computing architecture and software challenges. This work has paid off and we must remain committed to future excellence in this field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a listing of the world's fastest computers be printed in the RECORD. I would like for my colleagues to note that 8 of the top 10 computers are located at U.S. Department of Energy national labs and universities and this would not be the case except for the investments made by the Department of Energy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to express my concern about the current agenda of the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For about 16 days, we have been debating the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008. I do not think that any Member of this Chamber believes this is an unimportant or throwaway piece of legislation. This bill is about our troops and our veterans. It is about their health care. It is about their equipment. It is about how we treat those individuals who have put on the uniforms of our Armed Forces and served our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Defense bill before us authorizes $24.6 billion for the defense health program, including a $1.9 billion adjustment to fund TRICARE benefits. The bill includes authorization for the purchase of upgrades to Bradley fighting vehicles and the purchase of Stryker vehicles. This legislation authorized research into technology that will keep our troops safer while they carry out their current missions and research into medical technology that will help with battlefield diagnostics and care for  any wounded warrior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the midst of considering this troop-related bill, we are now considering amendments on items completely unrelated to the men and women in uniform. This kind of political gamesmanship is precisely why congressional approval ratings are at an all-time low.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Are we going to provide the resources our men and women in the military need by passing this Defense bill or are we going to stuff this bill so full of nondefense policy and programs that the legislation blows up like a makeshift terrorist explosive device? The majority party is in charge of getting critical bills through, yet they are delaying passage of these bills by trying to empty their outbox full of controversial issues. Unfortunately, the authors of these unrelated special interest amendments  have chosen the latter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first amendment set to come before us for a vote is legislation on hate crimes. When it is the appropriate time to be debating the merits of a hate crime bill then I will debate that. Debating it in relation to a bill we need in order to provide for our military is not the appropriate time. We have also been told to expect amendments related to immigration. The Senate earlier this year spent weeks on immigration legislation--that is where debate on that amendment should occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleague from Texas, Senator Cornyn, stated, there is a time and a place for everything. A bill drafted to address our national defense and our troops is not the place for these amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of focusing on the needs of our troops in the field, our wounded warriors needing medical attention, and our veterans who have served us all, the authors of these amendments seek to distract our attention and delay progress on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I sincerely hope all Members of the Senate will put these issues aside for a more appropriate time for debate and let us proceed on improving the lives of our troops. Let's put our troops first on the Senate agenda.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I was pleased to join my co-chair of the Senate Tanker Caucus, the senior Senator from Utah, in introducing amendment No. 2895. And I am very glad that the distinguished ranking member of the Armed Services Committee chose to join with our caucus in preparing a compromise amendment, No. 3104, that makes clear how crucial recapitalizing our tanker fleet is to our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senator McCain and Senator Levin for their leadership on this issue and their willingness to accept this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In October of last year, the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Air Force made a very important announcement. They declared that their top acquisition priority for the future is the replacement of our Nation's aerial refueling tanker fleet. This program could cost about $13 billion over the next 5 years, and perhaps $100 billion over the next three decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The senior Senator from Utah and I joined forces to form a caucus in support of this vital objective. We believe that updating our aerial tanker fleet is crucial if we are to continue to be able to project American military power around the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. national security strategy depends on a robust air refueling capability, as do our coalition partners. No other nation in the world has a comparable capability. The U.S. advantage in tankers is at the center of almost all the other strategic capabilities of our Air Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet today, our tanker fleet is the oldest part of the Air Force inventory making maintenance difficult and expensive. The KC-135 makes up over 90 percent of our refueling capability, but the average age of that fleet is over 45 years. The "E-Model" aircraft have the oldest engines and are rapidly declining in utility. Their mission capable rates have dropped significantly, and their cost-per-flying hour has increased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite generations of meticulous maintenance, these tankers are getting toward the end of their economic service life. Uncertainty about corrosion problems creates a significant vulnerability--we could find a serious problem in a few of these aircraft that could result in the whole fleet being grounded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that would have catastrophic results, as General Michael Moseley made very clear in comments on October 12. "In this global business we're in, the single point of failure of an air bridge, or the single point failure for global intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, or the single point of failure for global strike is the tanker," he said. "To be able to bridge the Atlantic, to be able to bridge the Pacific, or to be able to let business in the theater be persistent business in  the theater, it's the tanker."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To reverse that vulnerability, the Air Force is taking steps to replace these tankers. The tanker caucus supports that effort. The Air Force is also taking steps to make sure that a portion of the current tanker fleet is kept viable as they work to develop and buy the next generation tanker. This amendment supports that effort as well, by specifically referencing the Air Force's strategy to modify and upgrade an appropriate portion of the KC-135 fleet to ensure that it remains viable as the Air  Force waits for new tankers to be delivered. Nothing in this amendment would further constrain the Air Force's ability to retire the oldest tankers as they deem necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this amendment recognizes that the procurement of aerial refueling on a fee-for-service basis may also end up being part of the solution to preventing a temporary gap in tanker capability--though I doubt that it will make up a major portion of our overall tanker capacity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Air Force is working through two competing submissions for tanker replacement in response to the request for proposals it issued last year. This full, free and open competition will help to achieve the best value possible for the taxpayer on this major program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As General Moseley noted, "It's important to get started" on this important acquisition program. The time is right to begin recapitalizing this vital national asset. The Air Force predicts that a funding shortfall this year would likely lead to a 6 to 9 month delay in fielding the new tankers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The original amendment that Senator Hatch and I offered was co-sponsored by Senators Dorgan, Gregg, Roberts, Sununu, Cantwell and Inhofe. It simply expressed the sense of the Congress that timely replacement of the Air Force tanker fleet is a vital national security priority, and presented the reasons for that judgment. The McCain-Conrad amendment makes the same point in expressing  that  modernizing the tanker force is a vital national security priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While some members and some committees differ on the amount of funding that they believe is required to carry out this program fiscal year 2008, I believe that the Senate can agree that carrying out this program is a vital national security priority. I appreciate my colleagues' support for this amendment.</paragraph>
