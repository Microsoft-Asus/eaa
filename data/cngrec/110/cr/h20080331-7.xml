    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Georgia School for the Deaf's football team on winning the 2007 National Eight-Man Deaf Prep Football Championship. It's located in the heart of Cave Spring, Georgia, Floyd County, in my 11th District. The school has now won three national football titles since it was established in 1846, almost 160 years ago. This year's team finished the season with an outstanding 7 and 1 record, and they defeated schools from six other States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Tigers exhibited dedication, teamwork, and perseverance all season long, and it certainly paid off. I want to congratulate their Athletic Director and Head Football Coach, Erik Whitworth; his Assistant Coaches, Sidney Sharp, David Conti, Eugene Neal, B.B. Chubb, and Shawn Self, as well as the entire Tiger football team on a great season. Four of the team members, Patrick Bryant, Andy Sugg, Timothy Simmons, and Andrew Henderson were all selected as members of the All American  Deaf Football Team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, all of these athletes have brought much pride to Georgia, to the School for the Deaf, and the entire State, and I ask you to join me in celebrating their accomplishment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
