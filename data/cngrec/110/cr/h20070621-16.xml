  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my amendment, coauthored by my good friend, Mr. ALBIO SIRES of New Jersey, restores funds for Cuba democracy assistance to the administration's requested level of $45 million by offsetting $36 million from the Department of State General Administration Budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, as this chart so well demonstrates, the committee, while generally meeting or far exceeding the administration's requests for the rest of Latin America, something that I support, the bill funds Cuba democracy programs at approximately 20 percent of the President's request of $45 million; 20 percent for assistance for those brave men and women who risk their lives and their families' safety, unarmed, in a hard-line totalitarian police state to peacefully press for democracy in Cuba;  human rights activists, independent journalists, independent librarians, independent physicians. This aid goes to them and to their families, to the families of political prisoners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As explained, Mr. Chairman, in the letter from nine members of the pro-democracy movement to the six Cuban American Members of Congress, they attest and affirm that the assistance is key, and that it reaches them and that it has made and is making a great difference for the pro-democracy movement at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Mr. Chairman, the opponents of this effort asked for a GAO report on these programs, and I thank them for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the GAO report, after 18 months of thorough investigation, confirmed that the program is working. And I quote from the GAO report. "Dissidents we interviewed in Cuba said that they appreciated the range and types of U.S. democracy assistance; that this assistance was useful in their work, and that it demonstrates the U.S. Government's commitment to democracy in Cuba."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the GAO report detailed many successes, despite emphasizing the great challenges posed by the totalitarian police state for aid distribution. It talked about the GAO report, 385,000 pounds of medicines, food and clothing have been delivered to the pro-democracy movement and their families; more than 23,000 shortwave radios, millions of books, newsletters and other informational material.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. assistance reported independent journalists and including the publication of approximately 23,000 reports by those independent journalists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would call attention to the fact that the GAO report, while making absolutely no recommendation for any cut whatsoever in this program, does point out and make clear the case that it is an important and effective program; and after the GAO report, it has been significantly improved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I call the attention of all of my colleagues to the reply to the GAO report by the administrating agency, the USAID, where it delineates that all the GAO report's recommendations have been implemented. All of the recommendations have been implemented. That has made an effective and important program even more effective and important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let us not turn our backs on the Cuban internal opposition. They will play a key role in the inevitable democratic transition that is approaching, and we must do all we can so that they can survive the brutality of a totalitarian police state, of violence and terror that, fortunately, to a great extent because of the pro-democracy movement in Cuba, will soon be but a tragic and perverse historical memory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the Bush administration requested an increase in economic support funds for Cuba from $9 million to $45.7 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Between 1996 and 2005, USAID and the Department of State signed contracts worth $74 million for Cuba programs, according to the GAO's study. The administration is asking for a 1-year, fiscal year 2008 request that is more than two-thirds the size of what was committed over the 10 years, from 1996 and 2005. This request is 500 percent of what USAID received in the last fiscal year. Given how ill-conceived and ill-managed the program is, there is no justification for an aid increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friend from Florida has raised the GAO report and said that it has not recommended that funding be cut. But the objective of the report was not to recommend that funding should be increased or decreased. It was to examine the roles and objectives of the agencies implementing United States democracy assistance targeted at Cuba, and the characteristics and selection of the grantees receiving Department of State and USAID awards, the types, amounts, beneficiaries and methods used to deliver assistance  for selected grantees in 2005, USAID's monitoring and oversight of these grantees, and the availability of data to evaluate whether U.S. assistance has achieved its goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I believe that this program does little to help dissidents, and very little to expand political space in Cuba, we have continued funding at the same level as provided by our former colleague, Jim Kolbe, when he chaired the subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill has $9 million, and requires USAID and the Department of State to present a plan for improved coordination and for oversight of the Cuba program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>GAO concluded in a November 2006 report that "poor monitoring and oversight of the Cuba program did not provide adequate assurance that funds were properly used."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Administrative costs on the part of grantees were high, oversight of the goods chosen inadequate; specifically, according to the GAO study, there were instances in which cashmere sweaters, Godiva chocolates, Nintendo Gameboys, Sony Playstations were among the items purchased in the United States to be shipped to dissidents in Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Cuba program is poorly managed and can be argued to be counterproductive. It is not a productive use of limited U.S. resources, and the result of this program is often to identify Cuban dissidents as U.S. funded opponents of the regime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, at this time I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished coauthor of the amendment, Mr. Sires.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412186" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the funding that has been provided over the past 10 years to support the pro-democracy movement in Cuba has been working. U.S. assistance has provided books, newsletters and other informational material to the people of Cuba,  as well as over 385,000 pounds of medicine, food and clothing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a USAID report, U.S. assistance has also funded journalism correspondence courses for more than 200 Cubans, and the publication of about 23,000 reports by independent Cuban journalists about conditions and events in Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the Cuban regime restricts nearly all political dissent, and denies its citizens the basic rights of free expression, association and assembly, our funding and assistance has allowed the pro-democracy and civil resistance movement in Cuba to dramatically increase in recent years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As evidenced in this chart, from just 2004 to 2005 there was a 54 percent increase in the number of civil resistance actions reported on the island. Some of these civil resistance acts include citizens unwilling to cooperate with regime officials in repressing pro-democracy activities, and citizens boycotting regime control meetings and mass gatherings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By supporting this amendment, the pro-democracy movement in Cuba can continue to organize, communicate their vision for the future of the Cuban people, and prepare to assume the role in the process of democratic transition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it is also important to realize that Cuba now is at the same stage that Spain was many years ago when they had a dictator for 40 years. The world looked to Spain and saw that many of the institutions promoting democracy prevailed. If we don't work to promote dissidents who are pro-democratic dissidents in Cuba, we're not going to have any institution when the changes for a Cuban democratic island will exist.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400102" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the committee recommends $9 million for democracy programs in Cuba. I want to be sure that no one is misled by a claim that this is a cut. This is the same amount that the program received last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And last November, as has been noted, the GAO found serious problems with the administration of this program, as well as a lack of accountability which must be addressed, and this has not happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report is entitled "U.S. Democracy Assistance for Cuba Needs Better Management and Oversight." So to increase the funding to almost $50 million, or by about 500 percent, is not just irresponsible, it has an Alice in Wonderland quality about it. Reward mismanagement and incompetence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>No, my friends. The committee has acted wisely and I applaud the committee. It is demanding a spending plan and a strategy for how the funds will be used so we no longer will be sending cashmere sweaters to the tropical island of Cuba. Yes, this actually happened. I know it is hard to believe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program does not need any more money. What it needs is what it has never had before, and that is vigorous congressional oversight. Why does it need oversight? There is simply no time to list all of the programs. Read the report in full measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I would note that I found it particularly informative that over a 10-year period, $62 million of the $65 million in USAID grants was provided without competition. That is 95 percent of the money provided in response to unsolicited proposals with no bidding, no public notice, no compensation. No, this program doesn't need any more money. It needs oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I agree, let's listen to the dissidents like my friend Miriam Lay-VA, who is one of the founders of the Ladies in White. Here is what she says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"There must be no funds from any government allocated to the dissidents ..... the opposition gets practically nothing and the main thing is that it gives the Cuban Government a pretext to say that we are mercenaries and put us in jail. I'm against any funds from the American Government, and I think that if it wants to help the Cuban people, it should lift the embargo and allow trade, tourism, and academic exchanges, and Cubans should be allowed to travel without restriction to the United States  and send money to their families" in Cuba.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would simply remind my colleagues what if the policies advocated by those who are against this program had succeeded during the 1980s in Poland and Eastern Europe? Just ask yourself that question and remember when we did what we are doing here in the 1980s, what happened in Eastern Europe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield 1 minute to a distinguished leader and human rights activist from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews).</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Mr. ANDREWS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400008" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the amendment. I would like to first thank the gentlewoman, the chairperson, for the funding she has supplied for this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we are at a crucial time in the southern part of our hemisphere. I believe that it will go one way or the other in the years ahead. It will either be a breeding ground for violence, trouble, and difficulty; or it will be a breeding ground for the democratic values that will make us safer and stronger and more prosperous. Cuba is not the only country that will influence that decision, but it is a pivotal country. And I think an investment in the long-term process of promoting democracy  and prosperity in Cuba is not only in the best interest of the Cuban people but in the best interest of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the issues that my friend from Massachusetts talked about have been addressed and corrected. But I think the largest mistake that we could make would be to avoid our responsibility and opportunity to influence positively those who wish to bring democracy and the rule of law to Cuba at this very critical time in her history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on the amendment.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400263" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment, which seeks to send five times the current level of funding to so-called democracy assistance programs for Cuba. Five times the amount of money to programs that are not transparent; smack of cronyism; are noncompetitive; and, frankly speaking, foolish, corrupt, and just plain embarrassing for the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How bad is this program? So bad that Cuba's courageous Catholic Church refuses to work with it. Many dissidents have told me that they think that this program is a bad idea. For Cuban opposition leaders to take money from the U.S. Government subjects them to the charge that they are somehow U.S. agents. That is not the way to promote democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the committee bill, which keeps funding level at $9 million. It is the smart thing to do until problems outlined in the November GAO report have been addressed and the program redesigned and better managed so that it might have at least some chance of being effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, everyone in this House supports the work of Cuba's dissident and pro-democracy community. But we do not need to squander five times more money on leather coats, cashmere sweaters, Game Boys, crabmeat, and Godiva chocolates purchased by groups pretending to support them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What do Godiva chocolates have to do with promoting democracy in Cuba? Come on, give me a break.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people want accountability, and I hope a majority in this Congress will too. Vote "no" on this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the Congressman from Florida (Mr. Mario Diaz-Balart).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400108" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, at a time when the Cuban terrorist dictator and dictatorship is ailing, this bill guts the funding for the brave and heroic pro-democracy movement in Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, what has that money been used for in the last 10 years? This is in the report: medicine, food and clothing for the families of political prisoners; more than 23,000 shortwave radios; hundreds of thousands of newsletters and other informational material, including books; journalism courses to more  than 200 independent Cuban journalists who published almost 25,000 reports and publications from within the enslaved island.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hold in my hand a letter from a diverse group of brave opposition leaders in Cuba making it clear that this assistance is vital and desperately needed in the effort for a free and democratic Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I read the GAO report, both the classified and unclassified parts of it, and it does state that this assistance does reach the pro-democracy movement in Cuba. And it is important to note that all of the recommendations, every single one in that report, have been implemented, unlike what you have heard today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not the time to abandon those brave men and women, their families, the political prisoners, the opposition leaders, the independent journalists, labor leaders who are heroically and at a great personal risk working for a democratic transition in Cuba. This amendment, which is fully offset and CBO has scored as revenue neutral, will rectify the unconscionable betrayal and abandonment of the brave and heroic dissidents, the opposition leaders who are working under the toughest of conditions  for a free and democratic Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the adoption of this amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The speaker just said that unless we have this amendment, this program will be gutted. The truth is the committee keeps the funding level as it is, and I think given the GAO report, that is only proper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues have already mentioned, the GAO report that was commissioned by myself and Congressman Delahunt noted that there were items purchased with the money that is supposed to go to dissidents in Cuba: a gas chainsaw, Game Boys, PlayStations, a mountain bike, leather coats, cashmere sweaters. How is that going to help the dissident community in Cuba? I would submit not very much. But yet the same ones who support increasing this funding by five times also will not support allowing  individuals to visit their own family members in Cuba and take toothpaste or clothing items or even to take a fishing poll so that poor Cubans might supplement their meager diets. That, according to the group that wants to increase funding here, should be outlawed. We should continue to outlaw that but increase taxpayer funding for a program that the GAO says there was intense mismanagement,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a good amendment. If you believe in fiscal sanity, please defeat the amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's see what the dissidents in Cuba, in a letter and knowing full well the risks they take by sending a letter to Members of Congress about this issue today, what they say about the aid that this program has sent to Cuba and is sending:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"We can affirm that the aid that for many years has flowed to the pro-democracy movement takes into account the vast range of needs, from medicine to keep a political prisoner or dissident from dying, to food, water filters, medical equipment, clothing, shoes, coats, toys for the children of political prisoners who suffer doubly the loss of a loved one and social repression on the streets and in school, essential vitamins, office supplies, the tools of democracy, computers printers, phones,  fax machines, among others that account for the long list of articles and materials that have been made possible in Cuba."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And they thank the American people in the same way in which the people of Poland and the people of Eastern and Central Europe will be eternally grateful to the American people, including the Congress of the United States, for the support in their difficult days. The dissidents and the pro-democracy movement in Cuba thank the American people for this aid. And what President Bush has requested for the rest of the hemisphere is either being funded or exceeded, and yet for the only totalitarian police  state in the hemisphere, the committee has funded it at 19 percent. That is not justifiable, Mr. Chairman. That is why we are asking for the funding fully offset to be at the requested level by the administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please support this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Emerson).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400121" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me just say very briefly, because I don't need to repeat the fact that our taxpayer dollars have spent money for cashmere sweaters, mountain bikes, and the like that really aren't doing good for our dissidents, but I want to also mention the letter that our colleagues from Florida mentioned, the one that USAID sent. It did say that this program that we have is doing some good, which is why I and my colleagues support the funding that we have in the current bill.  But what was not mentioned was that in the same letter, the USAID also says that having restrictions on travel to Cuba, restrictions on sending goods to Cuba don't serve the dissidents well. So that begs the question, then. If the letter is important, the letter is important in totality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think because of the GAO report and the fact that we do not have good controls on the use of our taxpayer dollars that the old saying that President Reagan said "trust but verify" is very important, and it is time we verify before we send more money.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400435" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just to bring it back, one, this has nothing to do with trade. So the trade issue is not even out here. It also has nothing to do with the issue of travel, and I have asked for a visa to Cuba, and they denied me when I tried to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment should be called not the Diaz-Balart amendment. This should be the Sharansky amendment. This should be called the Yelena Bonner amendment. This should be the Havel amendment. I just read the interview with Havel the other day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we want to do with this money is the same thing that was done in Eastern Europe during the days of Ronald Reagan when we brought down communism. This is what we did in Romania to bring down the Ceausescu government. So this is a major cut. The Bush administration funds this to the pro-democracy groups in Cuba. They need this for training. They need this for their journalists. They need this for technical assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>They need this for so many other reasons. USAID reported U.S. assistance supported journalism correspondence courses for 200 Cubans; publication of 23,000 reports by independent Cuban journalists, on and on. Dissidents are routinely rounded up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this amendment passes, imagine how they will feel in Cuba today to know that the United States Congress stood with them. If it fails, they will be demoralized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is really the Sharansky amendment of 2007. This is the Havel amendment of 2007. This is the Yelena Bonner amendment of 2007. This is the amendment that we used to do in the 1980s to bring down communism, to help the civilian side, the dissidents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has nothing to do with travel; it shouldn't even be mixed with that. That's a mixed issue; it has nothing to do with trade. It is what do we do to help the dissidents; Armando Valadez has been in jail for almost 19 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, I would hope that we can come together and send a message that when this amendment is passed, the word goes forth as they listen to their Radio Free Cuba tomorrow to know that the United States Congress stood with them the way that they stood with Havel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Florida for the balance of the time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, Mr. Wolf has  said it all. This is an amendment not only of conscience, this is an amendment to help people who are risking their lives. Thousands who are in prison, hundreds recognized as prisoners of conscience by international organizations such as Amnesty International. They are risking their lives and their families' lives to peacefully advocate for freedom and democracy as those heroes mentioned  by Mr. Wolf advocated and risked their lives in Eastern and Central Europe in the 1980s, and they finally achieved freedom. And have no doubt that the dissidents in the pro-democracy movement in Cuba will be fundamental in the transition. They will be leaders in the future tomorrow, perhaps received in this Congress as the sovereign and elected leader of the Republic of Cuba, perhaps one of those political prisoners, I have no doubt, or those opposition leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is time to help them and, as Mr. Wolf said, send a message of solidarity and not retreat at this critical time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I misspoke, and I need to make a correction for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I was quoting about the restrictions, the people who wanted to remove the restrictions, I meant to say it was a letter from the dissidents, the Cuban dissidents, to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And also, I might add that the title of the report that our colleague from Florida cited is entitled, "U.S. Democratic Assistance for Cuba Needs Better Management and Oversight," which is why the committee report funding at $9 million is the right course today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>In response to the ranking member, I don't disagree when he suggests that we listen to the dissidents because they're on the island, they're fighting the good fight, not from the safety of Washington or Boston or Miami, but they're there. Let's start to listen to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was a statement that was released by four of them, prominent and well respected, on the island. It is a statement that was signed by Marta Beatriz Roque, Jisela Delgado, Elizardo Sanchez and Vladimiro Roca. Let's listen to what they say. Let's not reach our own conclusions here in this House without listening to what they say.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"We consider it very important to achieve greater efficiency in the use of these funds. We believe that one possible way to achieve this would be the elimination of a series of existing restrictions on the sending of aid and travel to Cuba, which doesn't at all help the pro-democracy struggle that we are carrying out inside our country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With all due respect to the gentleman from Virginia, it is about travel, it is about the embargo, because that's what the dissidents are saying to us here, and we ought to listen to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield to my friend and colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400263" topic="">
    <paragraph>And not only listen to the dissidents, but listen to the courageous Catholic Church in Cuba, which refuses to participate in this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had a policy for 50 years that has failed, it has been a failure. This is a continuation of the same old, same old. But even if you want to go down that road, the reason why you should oppose this amendment is because this program has been plagued with corruption and cronyism. We have used taxpayer moneys to buy Godiva chocolates and cashmere sweaters. I mean, come on. That is not a way to support dissidents.

    <paragraph>All these U.S. government policies have failed to bring about a change of leadership in Cuba. Unfortunately throwing more money at TV Mart&#xED; or democracy programs is not going to bring about a real change in Cuba. Real change can only be brought about by revolutionizing U.S. policy towards Cuba. Lifting the travel embargo--allowing for the free exchange of ideas and people between our country and Cuba--that's how we will support Cuban political discourse! That's how we will support freedom  of expression in Cuba. Support lifting the embargo--vote against the Diaz-Balart amendment and support a saner policy towards Cuba!</paragraph>

If you listen to the news today, there were 13 killed with regard to IEDs in the effort for demining. This also puts money in for training for human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, whether you want to go out today or whether you want to do whatever you want to do, we still need training for human rights, we still need training for capacity for democracy and governance, we still need ways for reconciliation to bring the parties together. We are always hearing about the differences between the different factions. That's what this money is for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration originally asked for $458 million. We knocked it down. We brought them in and said, what do you really need? They said, this is what we really need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is what the Iraq Study Group recommended. The Iraq Study Group recommendation number 6 says, "Building the capacity of the  Iraqi Government should be at the heart of U.S. reconstruction efforts, and capacity building demands additional U.S. resources." That's what this is on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge Members on both sides, this ought not be a political issue or partisan issue, to support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>With great respect for my good friend and ranking member, Mr. Wolf, we have just provided $2.863 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for Iraq, diplomatic operations and reconstruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, there are $3 billion for unexpended IRF funds. This amendment is requesting $140 million in additional funding for democracy, rule of law and governance programs. The supplemental provided $250 million for democracy activities, $67.6 million for civil society, $57.4 million for targeted development, $125 million in governance programs, and $150 million in rule of law activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment is also requesting $16 million in additional funding for nonproliferation, anti-terrorism and demining activities. The recently passed supplemental provided $7 million for demining in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, nowhere in this bill is there language restricting funding for humanitarian activities in Iraq. In my judgment, the administration should substantially expend the funds we have provided before Congress provides additional funding for the same purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And lastly, if the situation on the ground changes and our assistance can be used to make substantial achievements, we can address funding for Iraq as the President has requested, $2.893 billion in emergency appropriations for diplomatic operations and reconstruction in Iraq in fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, my colleagues, my good friend is requesting $158 million for purposes that have already been funded in a $2.8 billion supplemental. And there is another $2.893 billion supplemental coming up in September. I know that $158 million can be used for the tremendous needs around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly oppose this amendment, and I ask that my colleagues join me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of this amendment offered by Mr. Wolf of Virginia to restore $158 million to this bill for democracy, governance, rule of law and human rights programs. In addition, it will fund nonproliferation and anti-terrorist programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the debate in this Chamber over the future of Iraq and the best course of action has been passionate and divisive. Each Member of this House has their own opinion, yet the one thing we should be united on is that our end goal should be the same, a secure and stable Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, this bill predetermines failure by cutting off all funds to important democracy-building programs in Iraq. The majority has chosen to use this bill, as they have attempted several times already this year, to force a premature end to Iraq's pursuit of freedom and democracy. This will only lead to chaos and instability in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a consultant to the Iraq Study Group, along with Mr. Wolf of Virginia, we introduced a bipartisan bill, the Iraq Study Group Recommendations Implementation Act of 2007 which provides a comprehensive set of recommendations and a plan of action to succeed in Iraq. Included in these recommendations are suggestions for funding democracy, governance and rule of law, all the items that are funded by this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has garnered 52 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, who have recognized the potential we have by implementing these recommendations together and moving forward as a united Congress. If we allow this bill to pass without the money for building an Iraq democracy, we condemn our mission to failure and declare that the sacrifices we made over the past several years were in vain. It will also squander any opportunity we have to give the Iraq Study Group recommendations a chance to succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Wolf amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 4 minutes to the vice chair of this committee, my distinguished friend, Mr. Jackson.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400198" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have just provided $2.863 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for Iraq's diplomatic operations and reconstruction. As the gentleman has accurately noted in committee, the funding in this supplemental is tied up due to benchmarks; benchmarks that reflect the will of the American people and the Congress; benchmarks that presumably reflect the President's concurrence, as he signed them into law; benchmarks that can be argued are in the best interest of Iraq in becoming a stable democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, I believe the gentleman's argument is not valid, as the $2.863 billion we just provided will be available long before this bill comes back from the President's desk signed. Additionally, while I believe we provided sufficient funds for Iraq, I want to point out that the administration should substantially expend the funds that we have provided before Congress provides additional funding for the exact same purposes. Besides, Congress provided an extension of the authority to deobligate  and then to reobligate prior-year appropriations to the Iraq Relief Construction Fund, which, as of May 1, 2007, had $3.119 billion in unexpended balances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the committee, the gentleman raised the issue of visible support, as my last colleague raised in his remarks. I take a little bit of offense to that, because I think that every day our troops, our diplomats and aid workers are in harm's way, we show the greatest levels of support. What's more, none of the funding in the gentleman's amendment would go towards providing a safer environment for our men and women serving in the country of Iraq. We just provided $2.863 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let's take the gentleman's amendment apart for a moment and be clear on what we are considering. This amendment is requesting $140 million in additional funding for democracy, rule of law and governance programs. The supplemental provides $250 million for democracy activities; $67.6 million for civil society, and $57.4 million targeted for development, $125 million in governance programs, and $150 million in rule of law activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On page 58, line 18, the amendment is requesting $16 million in additional funding for nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, and demining activities. I want to make a couple of points about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The recently passed supplemental provided $7 million for demining in Iraq. We do not appropriate nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, demining-related program accounts by country. We appropriate this account by program to allow the administration the flexibility to adjust to emerging priorities and opportunities. This amendment would seek to change that and radically affects how the President performs his duties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, this bill, and I want to emphasize this, this bill for the first time fully funds the President's request for NADR, something I would note that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle could not claim when they were in the majority. The humanitarian demining account is funded at the President's requested level of $56.5 million. It does not need further funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On page 63, line 23, of the gentleman's amendment, where he requests an additional $2 million, the amendment is requesting this $2 million for foreign language training of Iraqi Security Forces. To date, we have provided $18 billion in training for the Iraqi Security Forces. $2 million. Where does this figure come from? We have provided $18 billion, and, now the distinguished ranking member seeks an additional $2 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have provided sufficient funding. Most of these accounts and numbers are unexpended. The administration should substantially expend those funds we have provided before Congress  provides additional funding for the exact same purposes, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, what is more, none of the funding in the gentleman's amendment would go toward providing a safer environment for our men and women serving in the country of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlelady from New York (Mrs. Lowey) for yielding.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400435" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank our ranking member for yielding time to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, while there are many disagreements about policy in Iraq, we can all agree that a military solution is insufficient. More evidence is clearly needed on the political, diplomatic, and economic fronts. But I have concerns about what I am hearing from across the aisle. Given the history, if we look back at the CR at the beginning of the year, there is a lack of clarity about how funds could be used by our State Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, we saw a marked reduction in human intelligence funding in the Intelligence authorization bill. In the supplemental, economic support funds were basically withheld. But some funding was restored through administration waivers. And now, in this bill, economic stabilization funds were basically zeroed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank our colleague, our ranking member, for trying in subcommittee and in full committee to restore this funding. With this amendment, which I believe is very essential to success in Iraq, he has put forth this effort. This funding is clearly important if we are going to fund the political and economic endeavor in Iraq. The State Department cannot complete its planning and implementation of phase three of putting together these provincial reconstruction teams which are absolutely  necessary to the success of the mission. So it is clear that we need for this amendment to pass to allow the State Department to plan and move.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the post-Cold War environment, we have grave responsibilities as a Nation. Yet we are refusing to fund our State Department worthy of this position of responsibility. The United Kingdom alone, which has one-fifth the population of the United States, has 5,600 diplomats worldwide and 130,000 troops. The U.S. has a mere 6,500 diplomats worldwide with 1.4 million troops, 2.5 million if you count our Reserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of this amendment. Clearly, it is the responsible thing to do to move forward. It restores $140 million in economic support funds, $16 million in nonproliferation, anti-terrorism and demining efforts, a critical, critical piece to this, and $2 million to increase international military education and training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a responsible thing to do. I urge all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my colleagues, I have a question for Mr. Boustany, my good friend, and the ranking member. I believe, Mr. Boustany, that you recommended that we fund this $158 million. Yet this amendment takes the money away from the State Department. Ambassador Ryan Crocker is doing a superb job. We just appropriated $2.8 billion in the supplemental. The American people have requested, and this Congress has requested, that we see some response to the benchmarks, that we see some  response on the part of the Iraqi Government to the benchmarks that have been put in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So if I understand correctly, even though the supplemental funded, and I am not going to repeat it, every single category that my dear friend, the ranking member and my friend, Mr. Boustany, are advocating for, you want to fund $158 million with funds from the State Department which are supporting Ambassador Ryan Crocker and other ambassadors around the world who are doing such an amazing job representing us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I really think there is a disconnect here. I want you to know that for those of us who are opposing this amendment, with great respect, again, to my ranking member, we feel that the supplemental that has passed and the $2.8 billion that is coming up in September requested by the administration can address these issues if, in fact, there is an understanding that they are not being funded adequately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, again, I strongly object to this amendment. I strongly object to taking funds away from Ambassador Ryan Crocker and our other ambassadors around the world and representatives of the State Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Shadegg).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400368" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment by the gentleman from Virginia. I think it is important to focus on this debate. There is no challenge greater than this facing America right now. It is vitally important that we succeed in Iraq and allow that nation to establish a democracy. I hear on the other side that, well, we have amply funded this already.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are imposing dramatic increases in spending in thousands of other areas, a 56 percent increase in HIV/AIDS funding alone. What message do we send if we reduce spending in this area at this time? I would argue that whether you want out of Iraq tonight or whether you support the current course, it is vitally important that we send every message we possibly can to the Iraqi people and to our Nation that we are doing everything we can to support democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>That is what these funds are for. Of course, other funds have been spent, but these funds continue the effort to tell the Iraqi people we stand with them. These are funds for domestic purposes, for their security, for governance and for rule of law. I believe it is vitally important, indeed critically important for our Nation, that we fund this money now. I rise in strong support of the gentleman's amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, just for the record, did the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Shadegg) suggest that we decrease the money for HIV-AIDS around the world?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400368" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, if the gentlewoman will yield. No, we are increasing it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thought you were suggesting that you didn't think that was a good idea; that it was more important to add to the $2.8 billion another $158 million and take it from the HIV funds. If I misunderstood, I apologize.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400368" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, if the gentlewoman will yield further, by no means was I suggesting we should not be doing that. In fact, that is a discussion for another day. What I was suggesting is that there are many places where we are increasing spending even more dramatically than is suggested by the gentleman's amendment here for what I believe is a vitally important purpose, which is democracy, rule of law and governance in Iraq.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, so the gentleman believes that the $2.8 billion in the supplemental is not adequate and we must add $158 million now, even though there is another $2.8 billion supplement requested by the President for the fall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to my good friend, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Jackson).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400198" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished chairwoman for yielding me the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question here is one of unexpended balances. The amendment is requesting an additional $140 million for rule of law democracy-related programs, but the supplemental that is still warm on the President's desk provided $250 million for those democracy activities, and they have not been expended; $67.6 million for civil society and $57.4 million targeted for development for $125 million in governance programs, and they still haven't been expended; $150 million in rule of law activities that  have not been expended as we move forward with the surge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Chairman, it is premature to request $140 million additional dollars, page 40, line 26 of the gentleman's amendment, for moneys that have not been expended that the Congress just voted on in this particular bill. The same can be said of the gentleman's request on page 58, line 18, and page 63, line 23, $2 million. We have $18 billion to date appropriated for Iraqi Security  Forces. Where does the figure $2 million come from? It comes from nowhere,  Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Support the chairwoman's request to defeat this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400435" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays). Members should know that Mr. Shays has been to Iraq 17 times and has been outside the umbrella of the military four times, and probably understands this issue in the Congress probably better than anybody else.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First I want to salute Mrs. LOWEY. I think you have done a very fine job on this legislation. I know you are focused on a lot of issues, and I congratulate you for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have disagreement on a few items in a very significant bill. I have strong concern about the lack of any dollars for economic development in the fiscal year 2008 budget, and that is what we are talking about. We are not talking about an emergency supplemental, which, by the way, has lots of strings attached, which may mean, ironically, money may not be spent ever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We Republicans and Democrats, want to succeed in Iraq, economically, politically, socially and militarily. We want to succeed. The challenge is I feel like we are pulling the rug out from under the chance to succeed economically and politically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason why I say "politically" is I have been there before, during and after the elections. This money helped educate the Iraqis on how to have elections. They did their elections better than we do our elections in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I was outside the umbrella of the military, people would say, why have you put my father, my uncle, my brother, my cousin, my son out of work, when we abolished all of their military. So when I hear we spent $18 billion to reconstitute their military, that is not a large number. It is money that had to be used because of what we did. We attacked them. They did not attack us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a moral obligation, I believe, to put Iraq in a better place. If we don't do it economically and politically, any effort militarily fails.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mean no disrespect, but it is almost like there is an interest in having Iraq fail, so all the predictions that it will fail will be proven right. We need to prove ourselves wrong. We need to succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These dollars should be, in my judgment, in the 2008 account, not in an emergency supplemental, whether now or in the future. The administration asked for $458 million. We asked the NGO's to say, what are your absolute needs for economic support, the rule of law, governance and democracy? And they have come back to us and said, we need $158 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just hope that the gentlewoman in her wisdom will reconsider her decisions.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to strike the last word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, with great respect, again, for our ranking member and for my friend Mr. Shays, who I know has been to Iraq many times, I do hope that in light of the supplemental, which has been funded at $2.8 billion, and an additional supplemental which will be presented to the Congress in September for another $2.8 billion, we won't cut the rug from under our good friend, the competent Ambassador Ryan Crocker, and take this $158 million from the State Department for several lines that  have been funded already in the supplemental. I won't go through that again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Ryan Crocker represents us, and I am so proud of his good work. I would like to support him and the other good men and women in the State Department around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let's defeat this amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I fully support the amendment offered by my good friend from Virginia (Mr. Wolf). This amendment gives vital assistance for demining, counterterrorism, rule of law programs, funding for Iraq military training and international human rights. We must remain committed to assisting the development of Iraq into a nation that is capable of governing itself, sustaining itself, defending itself and independently taking all necessary actions to root out terrorists and militias  that seek to undermine the transition to a free and sovereign Iraqi Government, continue to promote democracy and the rule of law, continue to provide necessary services to the people of Iraq and maintain the authority of the Government of Iraq in all parts of its national territory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues seek to cut integral components of our effort for cooperation and coordination with Iraqi leaders. Mr. Wolf's amendment correctly is aimed at strengthening the Iraqi Government to make sure that that nation can truly become self-reliant and stable, and not count on the U.S. as a blank check any longer.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400435" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, just in closing, the gentlewoman has been very good, and I appreciate the work of Mrs. Lowey on a lot of the issues. As Mr. Shays said, there are a lot of good things in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This, in closing, deals with the whole issue of demining, human rights training, criminal justice, rule of law and human rights. None of these things really ought to be controversial for anybody, whatever their position. Also they fit into the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think to offer an opportunity to heal and to build the private sector, the civilian sector in Iraq on these issues of human rights training is important, so when the United States is out, there will be respect for human rights, there will be criminal justice, there will be rule of law.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Is it the intent of the gentleman's amendment that these funds would somehow not be subject to the benchmarks established in the supplemental bill for funding and future funding in Iraq? Is this around the benchmarks?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400435" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I believe they would be. The reason we did this, I will tell my friend from Illinois, is when the $458 million was cut, we asked the administration to come up and tell us what they really needed, because we said this is a very difficult issue. The gentlewoman put a lot of programs with good money in. What do you honestly need? So everything would be in compliance with the benchmarks. But it would also give them the initial funding. They said, we actually  need this $158 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But they would be, to answer your question, in compliance.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400198" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman would continue to yield, if in fact, I certainly hope the Iraqi Government is able to achieve the benchmarks, but if in fact, for whatever reason, they are unsuccessful in achieving the benchmarks and the Congress of the United States is to recontemplate elements of the supplemental and additional funding for the efforts in Iraq, does this gentleman's amendment appropriate dollars that are not subject to the specific requirements of the  benchmarks established in the supplemental? Is this a funding in addition to that funding?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400435" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, this is fiscal year 2008, and these would be all issues that I think everybody on both sides, Republican, Democrat, independent, moderate, conservative, would be for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you go out on the street and say do you favor funding in the 2008 bill for demining, I think you would get a 90-10 yes. If you said do you favor funding for human rights training or whatever the case may be, people would say yes. Do you favor funding with regard to the human rights rule of law, they would say yes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment would provide $1 million to the U.S. Institute of Peace, referred to as USIP, for the purposes of reestablishing the Iraq Study Group (ISG). We want the ISG to revisit Iraq to evaluate the condition in Iraq 1 year later, to look at their findings and compare them to a year ago, and to look at their recommendations to see where they might alter them. That is what the amendment does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have spoken to Richard Solomon at the U.S. Institute of Peace, who said the Institute is prepared to do this, to reconstitute its expert working groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This would be done at the same time that we are going to hear from Ambassador Ryan Crocker and General David Petraeus, who will be giving us their findings. But the Institute wanted to make clear they would not be there to look at and evaluate the Crocker-Petraeus findings and recommendations, but it would simply be a report that would be provided at the same time to which people then could compare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spoke to one of the principals of the Iraq Study Group, Lee Hamilton. He said he is willing to take this effort on, provided it is to review what they did, to look at what has taken place in Iraq, to review their observations, their findings and their recommendations, but they would not be eager to take the Petraeus-Crocker report and analyze it. It would be done so there would be two instruments that Congress could look at.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>There may be a vote here. Mr. Udall and other Members, along with Mr. Shays and Mr. McCaul, have a bill in to make the Iraq study the policy for the Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my strong support for this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker and Multi-National Force Commander General David Petraeus will provide an assessment of Iraq this fall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The assessment will include the military, economic and political situation in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The assessment will be a key determinant for future U.S. involvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The debate over what to do in Iraq will continue and the Crocker-Petraeus assessment will be challenged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the report is positive Crocker and Petraeus must provide specific signs of progress and lay out in detail how long and how many troops will be needed in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the report is negative then Crocker and Petraeus should provide definitive steps on a phased withdrawal plan that reduces the number of lives lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whatever the outcome of the Crocker-Petraeus assessment we need an independent validation of the assessment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why I am supporting Mr. Shays' amendment to reconstitute the Iraq Study Group.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan group, that provided observations and recommendations to the President last December concerning the situation in Iraq would be reengaged and provide the American people a bipartisan perspective of what we can expect for the future of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With all the partisan debate we witness week in and week out in Washington, we must reconstitute this nonpartisan group, which has as its only goal, moving forward American interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it is time we come together and support this amendment to provide a bipartisan assessment of the situation in Iraq.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my amendment will increase our funding of international counterterrorist programs, while also calling out the United Nations for its continued reluctance to recognize and fight international terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are at war with an enemy whose tactics not only involve the destruction of non-combatants, women, little children, people just trying to work or buying something at the market; their tactics depend on such destruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Terrorists disregard the rules of warfare and strike at pure innocents. They wear no uniform and often do not even care about saving their own lives. Despite the fact that the world is in the throes of the violence of terrorism, the U.N. has done so very little to fight this threat on humanity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.N. marks progress against terrorism by how many committees they have formed and how many documents have been signed. We need a world body that does not consider an expanded bureaucracy as success. We need a world body that is a partner in the war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, the U.N. spends its time passing toothless resolutions on counterterrorism that even countries such as Iran, Libya, and Syria can support. These nations will continue to funnel money to terrorist organizations like Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Mahdi Army knowing that there will be absolutely no repercussions from the U.N.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment proposes to shift $20 million, approximately 3 percent of the U.S. contribution to the U.N., to antiterrorism assistance programs. If the U.N. is unwilling to join the fight against terrorism, we should reallocate our dollars, reallocate a portion of the funds intended for them to programs which are truly working to bring real peace to the world.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, the Clerk will report the amendment.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, hopefully that redesignation is a clarification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are trying to do is not, as in a subsequent amendment where we will be taking funds from the peacekeeping mission, which is what the gentlelady was referring to here, instead is to take money from the U.N. international organization line and redesignate those $20 million to join us in the fight against terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my opening comments to the Chair stated, the U.N. has done a woefully poor job when it comes to fighting terrorism around the world. We only have to look at the situation in the Sudan and Darfur, where they are not even able at this late date to define and tell us a genocide is going on. My goodness, the U.N. has not been able to grapple with the definition of what a genocide is, let alone take responsive action to try to bring it to an end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Likewise in the area of terrorism, the U.N. has again willfully and woefully failed to step up to the plate and be an instrument in fighting terrorism with so many of the world nations, the United States obviously taking a lead in that course.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the U.N. is not going to be the international body to step up and take affirmative action in these areas, I think it is incumbent upon us here in this House to make sure that our dollars, our limited American taxpayer dollars, do not go to an organization, the U.N., an international body that is not getting the job done; but instead, to reallocate those dollars, to reallocate $20 million. That is only 3 percent of the U.S. contributions to the U.N. to antiterrorism assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Homeland security, fighting terrorism, is one of the hallmark principles that I came to Congress to work on and to achieve end results on, and this amendment to this legislation will go to that end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to respond to the gentleman from New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do believe that nuclear nonproliferation must be a key focus of this committee and this Congress. In fact, in this bill because of the recommendations of so many members of our subcommittee and Members of Congress, we have increased money for nuclear nonproliferation efforts. So I look forward to working with the gentleman on this issue as we move ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I do think that your offset, taking money from U.N. dues, is actually unwise and not a very good policy decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many people have criticized the U.N., want to disband the U.N., want to cut off dues to the U.N., and then when we need the U.N., they wonder: What are we going to do if we didn't have a United Nations?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with the gentleman from New Jersey in strengthening the committees of the U.N. and working together to face the tremendous challenges we have internationally. So I support the gentleman's concerns about nuclear nonproliferation, and I look forward to working with the gentleman; but I strongly oppose taking the money from U.N. dues.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me be clear, we are in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. I understand that the gentleman is going to withdraw his amendment, but let me be clear, the various international organizations for which this account is designated and the dues that we pay not only to the U.N. but to other member organizations that our country is a part of, believe me when I tell you, the State Department has made it very clear in each of those organizations that we are  in a global war on terror and our contributions to those organizations, part of our mandatory obligations to those organizations for which the gentleman seeks to cut funding, would quite frankly undermine our ability to maintain our own status within those international organizations as we try to direct the global war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The spirit of the gentleman's amendment, some aspects of it are actually covered in the supplemental bill and some aspects of it are obviously covered in our bill, is something that is very difficult to argue against, an additional $20 million for demining activities. Part of this amendment was offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) in his amendment, and it is something in principle that we can support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sufficient in this bill are the resources to advance democracy activities and demining activities, but by cutting aid to international organizations and contributions, cutting our contribution, our mandatory contribution to those organizations, is something that I believe the chairman and the majority would reject.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the amendment I am offering would restore the funding level for international organizations provided in this bill to the fiscal year 2007 level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of my amendment is twofold. First, it would help bring accountability to organizations that have demonstrated limited effectiveness. Second, this amendment would help control the out-of-control Federal deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This keeps the funding level at last year's level, which was very reasonable. In fiscal year 2006, total interest payments on Treasury debt securities amounted to $405.9 billion, or about 14 percent of Federal outlays. That amounts to 1.7 percent of the U.S. GDP. Translated, that means 1.7 cents of every dollar produced by Americans is used to pay interest on the Federal debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a percentage of GDP, the Federal debt ratio is larger for the United States than it is in Finland, Ireland, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. By any measure, it should be clear to any responsible fiscal steward that Congress needs to do more to control deficit spending to help reduce the Federal debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would take a small but much-needed step in that direction. With a little help from the majority party in Congress, we could reduce unnecessary spending and return more money to the American people who earned it in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, I wonder what our constituents would think if they knew they were being forced to pay millions for perpetual, never-ending funding increases for organizations such as the International Bureau for Weights and Measures, the International Coffee Association, the International Copper Study Group, the International Hydrographic Organization, the International Lead and Zinc Study Group, the International Rubber Study Group, and the World Organization for Animal Health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the tremendous amount of funding contained in the bill for the United Nations, I am particularly interested in encouraging that body to reexamine its spending habits so it can be more effective at fulfilling its mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>As most would agree, the purpose of the United Nations is to help promote peace and security throughout the world. However, it has obviously failed miserably in that respect. Iran's nuclear weapons program is still chugging along at a rapid pace, threatening Israel and the entire region. Genocide persists in Sudan. All of the minds at the United Nations can't even agree on a definition for the word "terrorism" in an age where terrorism remains one of the biggest threats to humanity and civilization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, despite the implicit purpose of the United Nations Human Rights Council to promote global human rights, this body has among its membership notorious human rights abusers such as Angola, China, Cuba, Egypt, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Iran serves as the Vice Chair of the U.N. Disarmament Commission, Syria is the Rapporteur of the U.N. Disarmament Commission, Zimbabwe is the Chair of the U.N. Commission on Sustainable Development, and Sudan serves on the Executive Committee of the U.N.  High Commissioner for Refugees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And if that wasn't enough, an examination of a ranked list of countries subject to the most U.N. condemnation for human rights violations in 2006 reveals Israel ranking first, having received 135 actions, nearly twice as many as Sudan, the next country listed, and more than the number of actions directed at Iran, China, Colombia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia and Syria combined. The United States ranks fourth on this list, having been subject to 38 actions. This indicates that the United Nations is more  interested in condemning Israel and the United States than it is in horrendous human rights abusers throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that being said, the part of my amendment that should draw support from both sides of the aisle is the fact that my amendment doesn't cut a dollar from U.S. spending on international organizations. My amendment simply maintains the fiscal year 2007 level. By holding the line on spending, Congress can have another year to work on balancing the books and finding other ways to fund the increased spending proposals contained in the underlying bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, at a time when Americans are being asked to do more with their budgets, it is only reasonable to expect the same out of those who benefit from generous American donations. That is why it should be clear to all of my colleagues why they should support my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>This amendment would cut $203 million from our contribution to international organizations. This amendment fails to realistically address the effect our arrears have on our standing in the world community. At a time when the United States is increasingly relying on international organizations to further our security interests around the world, shortchanging our treaty-obligated contributions to these organizations undercuts our foreign policy goals and undermines our reputation around  the world. It also countermands our new Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad's call to pay our dues in full and on time. As of today, the United States is $291 million in arrears at the U.N. for regular budget contributions alone. The United States has chosen to belong to each of these organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration and the Congress have underfunded and cut this account in recent years. This amendment would continue this trend. The United States has an $80 million deficit in the CIO account and the State Department is paying U.S. dues late or incurring arrears in virtually every organization in this account. Shortfalls to the CIO account in 2006 caused the State Department to pay all of its regular dues to the IAEA almost a full year late, even as we relied on that organization to track  nuclear developments in Iran and North Korea; pay dues to our allies in the OECD almost a year late; pay all of our dues to the WHO about a year late, even as we asked WHO to help contain avian flu; and pay the vast majority of our regular dues to NATO a year or so late, even as we relied on that organization to shore up security in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment has no appreciation of the influence this increasing trend of paying late and underfunding international organizations has on our ability to sway others and it is difficult to justify why our priorities should be given full consideration when we chronically pay our dues late. Paying these international organizations late is counterproductive to achieving United States international security goals. The increasing trend of paying late and underfunding international organizations  confounds U.S. demands for better management in them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An example of this detrimental effect is seen at the World Health Organization which reports that the arrears owed by the United States are preventing well-managed budgets and resulting in programs not reaching optimal effectiveness for a year or more after they were planned to be fully operational. Further, other dues-paying countries take note when the United States fails to honor its commitments in these international organizations. As a result, our influence on making budgetary and policy  decisions in them is lessened. For example, the U.S. consistently wants the Food and Agriculture Organization to increase its capacity to set worldwide food and plant standards, yet it is very difficult to justify why U.S. priorities for the FAO should be given full consideration when the U.S. is chronically paying its dues there about a year late.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, I strongly object to the gentlewoman's amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I rise in opposition to the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone has frustrations. I think the U.N. could do certainly a lot more on Darfur and many of the other things. They stood by and frankly didn't do very much in Rwanda, either. But what this amendment would do, I think, is people have to look at it. This would actually cut NATO fees, and NATO is sort of the backbone of what we're doing in Afghanistan and many other places, but particularly $41 million out of this fund goes to NATO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, on the World Health Organization with regard to avian flu and things like that, this is not the time to do that. Also, there is another issue that I have personally made a cause, of funding the war crime tribunals to bring people to justice. This would cut the war crimes tribunal in Rwanda where over 800,000 people have died between the Hutus and the Tutsis and that whole issue. Also the former Yugoslavia where after the genocide that took place, Milosevic was brought to the court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So for those reasons, I understand what the gentlelady is trying to do. But I think this would be the wrong place to kind of do it, from NATO and IAEA and the World Health Organization and the war crimes tribunal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, this is at the request of President Bush, of the Bush administration. This is what the Bush administration, President Bush, has requested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those reasons, I urge a "no" vote.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to offer an amendment that will partially restore the administration's funding request for the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement account in the FY08 State Department and Foreign Operations appropriations bill. This amendment would add $30 million to the account, halfway between the committee funding level and the President's request. This is a bipartisan amendment. I would like to thank my colleague on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Cuellar, for his support  as an author and cosponsor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this month I attended the U.S.-Mexico Interparliamentary Group in Austin, Texas, and for 3 days we talked about issues important to the United States and Mexico. The major topic discussed was the issue of increasing violence and lawlessness along the U.S.-Mexico border. The drug cartels have taken control over northern Mexico and law enforcement has become corrupt and ineffective. Since his inauguration earlier this year, President Calderon has begun a renewed effort to reestablish law  enforcement's control over his country and their borders. However, the drug kingpins are ruthless in their efforts to retain control and the Mexican Government's law enforcement capabilities are sorely outdated. Just recently, the drug cartels brazenly ordered the assassination of a Mexican state legislator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take a moment to commend Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member Wolf for including $27.5 million in the bill for this effort and for recognizing in the report language of the bill the need to address this problem which so devastatingly impacts our southern border, our national security and the citizens of this country. However, I believe that additional funding would go a long way to eradicating the drug cartels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The offset in this amendment is a $30 million reduction in the contributions to the international organization's account. I believe it's a worthwhile transfer of funds that will benefit not only our border with Mexico but also our counterdrug efforts worldwide. One of the most important international peacekeeping efforts today should be on the southern border against the violent criminal enterprise of the narcotraffickers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cartels control the corridor routes into this country, exporting drugs and human trafficking across our southern border. The intersection between these criminal enterprises and potential terrorists could be deadly. In the post-9/11 world, we can no longer continue to ignore this threat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when the newly elected Mexican Government has stepped forward and made a commitment to reform its law enforcement and combat the drug cartels, it is important that we provide as much funding and resources as possible to the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Again, Madam Chair, I thank you for the time and I also appreciate the work that you have done in making sure that we help the Mexican Government fight the drug cartel problems that they have. We have a perfect opportunity at this time, and I think Mr. McCaul understands this since we have been working on this for a while, that they have a President now, President Calderon, that is willing to go ahead and take on the powerful drug cartels. Being from Laredo, Texas, I see  what's been happening across the river. We had, talking about one of the Congressmen, my counterpart right across Laredo in Nuevo Laredo, there was an attempt to assassinate him, he ended up in the hospital, his chauffeur got killed, because again he wanted to go ahead and fight the drug cartels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is extremely important that we provide this extra funding because if we don't, what you're going to have, you're going to have a bigger problem than what we're seeing right now across the river. It has permeated not only the law enforcement, it has not only permeated also the judiciary, but it has also affected other parts of the society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The Mexican Government wants to work with us, and I want to make sure that we work on increasing the dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My understanding is, and I am hoping that my colleague will be willing to do that, that if we can withdraw this amendment, I believe we have a commitment from the chairwoman that in conference committee she will go ahead and increase the dollars, because we need more than what's been appropriated so far, what's currently in the bill itself.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I will consider withdrawing the amendment. I would like to get a few assurances from the gentlelady, if I may, and that is that this funding would be directed primarily, would be targeted towards the problem at the U.S.-Mexico border with the drug cartels who have controlled these corridors that I mentioned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I could just add, my subcommittee on Homeland Security issued this report on the border last conference confirming the threat. This was given to President Calderon by Secretary Chertoff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He understands this. I have met with the Mexican Congress. They understand it. Our State Department actually does understand this. While they may not ask overtly, they really could use these funds to confront this threat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask, in exchange for withdrawing, that we try to come as close as possible to the number I have requested and that that money be directed towards the threat that Mr. Cuellar and I see so often down in a border State.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="CONTRIBUTIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING ACTIVITIES">
    <paragraph>First of all, I want to begin by saying that I am pleased that the committee has taken steps to see that the United Nations peacekeeping forces are not or will not be engaged in human trafficking or other sex crimes. But I am concerned that the language in the bill, quite frankly, does not go quite far enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The facts are that between 2004 and 2006, 179 peacekeepers from the U.N., under their charge, under their control, were dismissed or repatriated following investigations for sex crimes. Yet only a very few of these have been successfully prosecuted for their crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, The Daily Telegraph newspaper revealed that members of the U.N. force in southern Sudan had abused children as young as 12. Just last year, the U.N. had tried to claim that these reports were just unfounded rumors, but only after these reports did the U.N. admit to repatriating four of these individuals for these crimes. Yet none of these four have ever been prosecuted in their home country of Bangladesh.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just this week, the Government of Sudan agreed to a substantial peacekeeping force in Darfur. We must ensure the people of Darfur, who have been subject to a systemic rape and violence constituting genocide, do not suffer further at the hands of the people who are there to protect them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am concerned that the language in the present bill that the U.N. "hold accountable" these individuals will mean that the U.N. peacekeepers will continue to get away scot-free. All national armed forces have processes for court martial and punishing crimes committed by their personnel. The U.N. must see to it that these countries offering peacekeepers actually apply their system of justice when a crime is committed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.N. is supposedly committed to high ideals of human rights and justice. We are merely asking that they keep them to ensure that their own personnel and others operating under the U.N. flag do not use their position to commit gross crimes. Let us be clear that the United States taxpayers funding these important missions will not stand for this injustice.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, while we in this Chamber can debate in freedom, and the American people can hear and see our every word, thanks to a free press, in Hugo Chavez's Venezuela, the only thing that people can see or hear are the things that Hugo Chavez lets his media print and broadcast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Freedom of the press died in Venezuela on May 27, 2007, when Chavez shut down RCTV. This was just the latest in a long line of actions to snuff out free press, free speech, and free thought. By shutting down the largest and oldest TV network in the country, Chavez is sending a message to all other media that he has the power to do anything he wants to with radio and television stations in Venezuela.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The government is targeting opposition voices because of their massive reach, appeal, and influence throughout the country. Chavez said: "I am going to go after those who resist the revolution and eliminate them one by one." This was in reference to one of the only remaining independent voices left in Venezuela.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the window of independent media in Venezuela closes, Voice of America will play a critical role in getting the truth out about what is happening in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Voice of America must provide and create additional programs. With targeted funding, Voice of America can have an even greater ability and capability to broadcast longer with more programming. Voice of America serves as a significant counter to Chavez's propaganda being exported to Nicaragua, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would significantly grant the Broadcasting Board of Governors the tools to increase broadcasting to Venezuela and Latin America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chavez's communist plans for the future do not include independent media and freedom of the press. We must recognize the war on terrorism is in our backyard. The gang of countries lining up with Chavez is powerful: Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua and others, together with the likes of Iran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must recognize a serious threat to our national security. In fact, just this morning, Chavez announced plans to visit Iran in a few weeks, following a long courtship between the two countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The window of freedom is closing fast. We cannot turn our backs on the people of Venezuela. We must do more to promote freedom inside Venezuela.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America has always been a beacon of freedom in our hemisphere. Now we must be the pillar of hope for the people of Venezuela and our friends and neighbors in Latin America who fear Hugo Chavez and his communist revolution.</paragraph>

Your bill on the floor today contains a section concerning the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction that extends the authorities of that office.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTING OPERATIONS">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy, as I appreciate the hard work that she and her committee have done bringing forward, I think, a really terrific bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to enter into colloquy with you, Madam Chair. At the end of 2005 Congress passed the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act with broad bipartisan support. At the time it was called landmark legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, today it's clear that the intent and many of the legal requirements in the Water for the Poor Act are not being met by the State Department and USAID.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this month the State Department delivered its second report on the required drinking water and sanitation strategy. Unfortunately, it continues to be more of a recitation of the work they're doing, rather than a strategic, forward-looking road map to move from the current state of access to achieving the international commitment to cut in half the percentage of people without access to safe drinking water and sanitation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While our legislation was specifically written so that it would improve aid quality at any level, there was also a call to increase the amount of resources devoted to the very poor. For instance, as part of the strategy, we required an increase in the percentage of assistance going to high-priority countries, defined as countries with the greatest need, and countries in which assistance would be expected to make the greatest difference. Many, if not most of these countries would be in sub-Saharan  Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long the State Department has used disaster funding to artificially inflate the numbers it used to meet congressional requirements, instead of giving the necessary focus to long-term sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation for the poor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long, sub-Saharan Africa has gotten funding that is inversely proportional to the level of need. For too long the State Department has treated Water for the Poor Act as if it were a guideline or a suggestion, rather than a law passed by Congress and signed by the President that they're obligated to fully implement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I very much appreciate the work of Chairwoman Lowey and Chairman Obey, for whom I know this is a particular interest. I deeply appreciate increasing the overall level of funding for water and sanitation to $300 million, and directing that much of it be spent pursuant to the Water for the Poor Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope for the opportunity, as we move forward towards conference, to work together to ensure that as much money as possible is made available to the long-term development of safe drinking water and sanitation programs in the areas of greatest need, with a strategy needed to ensure that we're make the most effective use of our AIDS dollar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most important, I hope that the Appropriations Committee will continue to help with the oversight needed to make the Water for the Poor Act fully implemented and the United States lives up to our international commitment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTING OPERATIONS">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentleman's interest in this issue and applaud your work over the past few years. As you have stated, the committee bill increased funding for safe water by $100 million and placed priority on long-term and sustainable safe water programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report provides clear direction to the agency that funding must be provided in accordance with the strategy based on the Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, we share the gentleman's concern about the reliance on emergency programs to meet this recommendation, and will work with the agency in the coming year to ensure that this does not happen again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank you for raising these issues today. I look forward to working together on this issue in the coming year.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I am reassured that your intention that only $80 million of the $300 million level come from disaster assistance. That's an important step in making the necessary long-term investments to deal with this leading cause of preventable death in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm particularly pleased by the requirement that funds be spent in accordance with the Water for the Poor Act, which was carefully crafted to provide a framework, a policy and a goal for ensuring affordable and equitable access to safe drinking water and sanitation for the poorest in this world. I look forward to the opportunity to continue to work with you.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTING OPERATIONS">
    <paragraph>I am delighted to yield 3 minutes to my good friend, Mr. Payne, who is really an expert on Africa and all phases of African development, and has a keen interest in water. And I thank you for coming.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTING OPERATIONS">
    <paragraph>Let me thank Congresswoman, Chairwoman Lowey and, of course, Congressman Blumenauer for the opportunity to join in this colloquy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health, I recently called a hearing on the implementation of the Water for the Poor Act where Congressman Blumenauer testified. I agree with him that the State Department, in its 2007 report to Congress, reflects inflated figures and a lack of concrete strategies for providing sustainable access to drinking water and sanitation for the poor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Millennium Development Goals, a catalyst for the Water for the Poor, aimed to reduce by one-half the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation and safe drinking water by 2015. Due, in part, to the State Department's inefficient execution of sustainable programs, the MDG target is being missed in sub-Saharan Africa, which has had the slowest rate of improvement in this category compared with all other regions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the State Department reported that in fiscal year 2006, the U.S. helped 9 million people receive improved access to water. Of the beneficiaries, 75 to 80 percent was in the Middle East, and 25 percent was outside this region. According to the United Nations, most countries in the Middle East and North Africa are on track towards reaching the MDG targets. Our efforts should be directed to regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, which has the highest proportion of people living without  access to improved water sources of any region in the world, and is not on track to meet its MDG target. Therefore, of the $150 million appropriated to Africa and the Middle East, I feel that more than 50 percent should be allocated to the countries in Africa, where the need is greatest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I conclude by saying also, the State Department's water funding in Africa has primarily been used for emergency relief efforts, rather than water supply and management projects that deliver sustainable results. In maintaining the vision of the Water for the Poor Act, assistance should be focused on improving the sustainable management of drinking water and sanitation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with Congressman Blumenauer and Chairwoman Lowey that of the $300 million appropriated for fiscal year 2008, a significant amount should be directed towards sustainable water management with programs in Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With efficient execution and adequate funding, the objectives of the Water for the Poor can be accomplished. Access to safe water and sanitation plays a central role in promoting global public health, economic growth, poverty reduction and environmental sustainability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with Congressman Blumenauer and Congresswoman Lowey in increasing our funding to regions with the greatest need and improving the strategies in place to provide the world's poor with sustainable, safe, drinking water and basic sanitation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400657" topic="INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTING OPERATIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, again I also want to echo what the other Members have said on your leadership on this particular bill, very important bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what I want to do, Madam Chair, is point out two things that you have selected that are very important to my district, south Texas, the border area. The first one has to do with the funding that has been increased for the International Boundary Water Commission that provides funding for the levees that we have along the U.S. and Mexico border. The current budget right now is at $2 million. You have brought that up now to an amount of almost $16 million. This, again, is appreciated again by  my office, my constituents, but also by Congressmen Rub&#xE9;n Hinojosa and Solomon Ortiz that have levees down there. This is an issue that has to be addressed because, again, we don't want to see what happened in another part of the United States. This levee work is very important. It's important to the areas of mission, McAllen and the other areas in south Texas. This will go a long way and, again, Madam Chair, I want to thank you for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank you for some report language that you added, something that, again, Michael McCaul and myself have been very interested in, and that is the issue of the trafficking of human, what we call human cargo, also drugs, cash and of course the missing Americans. As you know, there are people that live in the United States that have gone over across the river into Nuevo Laredo and have been kidnapped and have not been found. We've been asking the Mexican Government for years  to provide us information so we can bring some sort of closure to this particular situation. And again, we have not gotten this, and we're hoping that the Mexican government will provide us this information as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this report language, Madam Chair, that you have added will provide us this incentive and hopefully an incentive to the Mexican Government to work with us to provide us information on the missing Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, Madam Chair, I want to thank you very, very much for adding, increasing the amount of the levees from $2 million to almost $16 million. On behalf of Congressmen Rub&#xE9;n Hinojosa and Solomon Ortiz, we thank you very much for your leadership.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Clerk will designate the amendment.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment which increases the amounts available in the Foreign Operations appropriations bill to fight the global spread of tuberculosis by adding an additional $50 million by taking $25 million from the Economic Support Funds account and $25 million from within the Child Survival and Health Programs account.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the World Health Organization estimates, someone is infected with the organism that develops into TB every second. Every second. An infected person may not develop full-blown TB, but in 2004, of the 9 million people who were newly infected, 2 million died. The good news is that it is entirely curable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the treatment requires patients to be on a drug regimen for 6 months. If they do not complete the regimen, or if they complete it but take an incorrect number of pills during the treatment, the infection can develop into what is known as multiple drug resistance or MDR-TB. MDR-TB is not responsive to either of the two first-line TB drugs, and the treatments that are available take longer and are more expensive than regular TB medications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as news headlines earlier this month have shown, there is an even more deadly threat: extensively drug-resistant TB. XDR-TB is not only resistant to the two first-line drugs but also to three of the six second-line drugs. The treatment required to cure a patient can be radical, including the removal of part of the lung that has been infected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this month, a Georgia man who had been diagnosed with a dangerous strain of TB known as extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis, or XDR-TB, traveled through four countries, completely unimpeded. If he had been infectious at the time, there could have been an outbreak across two continents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must also keep in mind that XDR-TB has a deadly linkage with HIV and threatens to undermine all of the investments we have made in the global fight against HIV/AIDS. The devastating effect of patients with HIV first gained global recognition last August with reports of an outbreak in a hospital in South Africa where 52 of 53 patients with XDR-TB died. Half of them died within a matter of 16 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This tragedy serves as a sobering example of what may happen across Africa if we do not act to prevent another outbreak. Given XDR-TB's resistance to both the low-cost, first-line anti-TB drugs and to several of the classes of second-line drugs used, we are faced with a burgeoning epidemic driven by HIV infection that is lethal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the initial outbreak, South African medical authorities have documented some 400 cases in dozens or more hospitals in South Africa. What is troubling, however, is that no one knows for sure that these 400 cases represent the extent of the outbreak because XDR-TB typically kills quickly and doctors' ability to identify it is severely limited; so many people may have simply died without its even being diagnosed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Experts believe that XDR-TB has moved beyond South Africa into other countries in the sub-region where the capacity to identify it and control it is significantly weaker than in South Africa and where the HIV/AIDS rate continues to drive the epidemic. As a matter of fact, there are only two laboratories in 48 countries in sub-Saharan Africa that can determine this disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us here today must work together to take the necessary steps to enhance the ability of the medical establishments in Africa and other developing countries to identify, treat, and stop the spread of drug-resistant TB, primarily in Africa, and to head off further incursions of XDR-TB into the United States. Failure to do so will result in potentially devastating health catastrophes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>While we overwhelmingly support the gentleman's amendment for an increase in $50 million, the offset does  have the effect, Mr. Payne, of robbing Peter to pay Paul. The committee worked very hard to increase the child survival account, which is another health care account that includes maternal health, that includes malaria accounts, and we worked very hard to increase the ESF account, which does impact profoundly sub-Saharan Africa, Afro-Colombian  programs, and Israel and Egypt. And while these funds are extremely important, the subcommittee did the best that it could in the original mark to increase funding for tuberculosis, particularly the extremely drug-resistant strands of tuberculosis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I rise in strong support of the gentleman's amendment, and I also rise in strong support of the committee's initial mark, which did everything it could within its power to increase child survival and ESF funds.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, we accept the amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne).</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me begin by thanking the chairwoman and her staff and the vice chairman of the committee for working with my office, and of course the ranking member and their staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is evident how hard this committee has worked on a very broadband, wide-reaching initiative as it relates to appropriations in the foreign relations, foreign affairs of this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the authorizing committee, we recognize that this committee touches the heartbeat of every aspect of the world's business, and the importance of the United States in creating internationalism for the greater good of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I listened to Mr. Payne, my amendment falls squarely in track of improving the health conditions of Africa and recognizing the need for hospitals that in fact will respond to a number of issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment reallocates an additional $5 million to the Child Survival and Disease Fund to increase the amount of funds appropriated for child and maternal health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of this amendment is to direct additional funds for technical assistance to provide capacity-building for hospitals in Africa that deal with child-surviving and other relevant needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been, if you will, screening the research annals across this Congress to try to find out how many full-service hospitals are on the Continent of Africa. Some have said 200, some say I know that there's one in Sierra Leone. Some say they know there's one in South Africa. But I can assure you that the plight of women who are pregnant in Africa is a severe plight. Take, for example, that every minute somewhere in the world, a woman dies from pregnancy-related causes, with 95 percent of those  deaths occurring in Africa and Asia. Worldwide, about 529,000 women die from pregnancy-related causes every year. A woman in sub-Saharan Africa has a 1 in 16 chance of dying in pregnancy or childbirth. Part of the care and prevention of such is preventative care,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I might cite, as an example, the Mutombo Hospital in Kinshasa, Congo. It is a hospital that has 300 beds, three operating rooms, an outpatient clinic, an emergency room, a pharmacy. You cannot find that, Mr. Chairman, across Africa. Therefore, I believe there is a definitive need to provide them technical assistance so that we don't have to guess what number of hospitals are in and on the continent, but we will know that they look somewhat like this, with operating rooms, with expansive facilities  to provide treatment for mothers and babies, treatment that will be lifesaving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairwoman, let me simply say that I had an experience in a hospital in Africa. One of my first medical experiences was to require sutures in an accident in Africa. Let me thank those medical professionals who helped me be here today, but I want you to know that I was laying out on a wooden slab and looking through tattered curtains and looking at the sky as the doctors were working on me. That was the hospital that I was in on the continent. I do not say it in degradation or insult. What  I say is I would venture to say that if we go to Africa today, and many other countries, the kinds of facilities that are there reflect that kind of lack of resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This will help not only in maternal and child survival because of the loss of life of mothers who are pregnant and who give birth with facilities that would provide hospital resources, but it will also, if you will, give encouragement to the continent, as has been done by the hospital in Kinshasa, Congo, Mutombo, who I hope will also be, as they say, "in the mix" on providing opportunities for others to see what can be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that this amendment will be accepted because it will go a long way for expanding the lives of mothers and children, but it will also go a long way for ensuring that we believe in good hospital care, excellent hospital care across the Continent of Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk and I rise to speak in support of amendment #2 to <bill type="h" number="2764">H.R. 2764</bill>, the State and Foreign Operations Act of 2008. I would first like to thank Chairwoman Lowey for her extraordinary leadership and guidance in crafting this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2764">H.R. 2764</bill> will play a crucial role in restoring the global respect to this country that many around the world had so eagerly rewarded it in the past for its historical humanitarian efforts. America, that beacon upon the hill, will shine a little bit brighter amongst those who will through this bill, be able to get healthcare, and whose very lives are dependent upon such care. Among these spared lives are many, many children and women who would needlessly perish from the perils of poverty without  our support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, sparing lives of children and women starts with ensuring that they have adequate healthcare. That is why I offer my amendment which provides: on Page 29, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert (increased by $5,000,000) (reduced by $5,000,000). In offering this amendment, my intent is to increase the amount of funds appropriated for child and maternal health by $5,000,000. The reason that I urge support for increased funds for child and maternal health is that the greatest threat  for the quality of life for our children all around the world is lack of health care for the mother and child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the United States, the birth of a child in most instances is a time of joy because the mother and baby go home from the hospital together, healthy and happy. Sadly, however, in poor countries childbirth can be dangerous and potentially tragic for both mother and child. Take, for example, that every minute, somewhere in the world a woman dies from pregnancy-related causes, with 95 percent of these deaths occurring in Africa and Asia. Worldwide, about 529,000 women die from pregnancy-related  causes every year--about the number of women and girls who live in Dallas, Texas or San Diego, California. A woman in sub-Saharan Africa has a one in 16 chance of dying in pregnancy or childbirth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, with less than 200 full-service hospitals, Africa desperately needs our assistance because without it, Africa will continue to fall far short of providing the necessary and proper life saving healthcare for its population. About 3.4 million babies die every year due to poor maternal health and inadequate delivery care. In addition, an estimated 100,000 women a year in poor countries develop obstetric fistulas, a condition caused by obstructed labor and creates permanent holes in  their bladders that cause continual leaking of urine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every year, more than 10 million children under the age of five die from totally preventable deaths. Some are directly caused by illness such as pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria. Others are caused by indirect causes including conflict and HIV/AIDS. Malnutrition,  poor hygiene and lack of access to safe water and adequate sanitation contribute to more than half of these deaths.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is even sadder, Mr. Chairman, is that two thirds of both neonatal and young child deaths--over 6 million deaths every year--are preventable. Half a million women die in pregnancy each year, most during delivery or in the first few days thereafter. Obstructed labor, hemorrhaging, and infection, can all be averted provided a woman has access to safe and appropriate pre-natal care. Madam Chair, the increased funds from my amendment would be dedicated to providing women with this vital care.  Specifically, these funds would contribute to capacity building for hospitals in Africa which engage in child-survival and maternal health programs. We have seen the positive impact that these facilities have made within the health care environment. Professional basketball star Dikembe Mutombo established the Biamba Marie Mutombo Hospital and Research Center, a hospital that provides desperately needed</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Existing low-cost, low-technology and high impact interventions such as vaccines, antibiotics, micronutrient supplementation, insecticide-treated bednets, improved breastfeeding practices and adoption of safe hygiene practices can prevent unnecessary maternal and child deaths as well as reduce malnutrition. By packaging services and implementing at scale, high impact and evidence-based maternal, newborn and child survival interventions, we can save millions of lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I stand here today, I reflect upon my visit to Honduras in 2001, and I remember how important the child and maternal health crisis was, and now recall how that it was in part the impetus behind my founding of the bi-partisan Congressional Children's Caucus in 1997. As I have done since 1997, I will continue to make it a priority to support initiatives that protect the health and welfare of children worldwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the success in reducing infant and maternal mortality and reducing family size and nutrition strongly depends on support from this noble nation. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment that will go a long way to save the lives of many women and children.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Clerk will designate the amendment.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE">
    <paragraph>To the chairman of the Foreign Affairs, Foreign Relations Appropriations Committee, let me thank you for your leadership, and to the ranking member as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I think we know the story of Liberia. And I want to applaud the new President of Liberia, who has visited us, someone who understands economics and is committed to the success of this nation. She cannot, however, do it without friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Liberia has an enormously important nexus to the United States. It was where slaves were returned back to the Continent of Africa after having been enslaved here in the United States. I look forward to reenergizing the relationship, not only with the continent, but also, particularly with the nation of Liberia after a very troubling and very violent time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our new President of Liberia is tracking all of the needs, accounting for all of the dollars. My amendment simply seeks to reallocate an additional $5 million for the Republic of Liberia of the $365 million Development Assistance account. The net effect would be to increase developmental assistance to the Republic of Liberia to $35 million. Let me explain why this would be a wise investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard recently from Bob Johnson, the former chairman of BET, who has taken a special interest, private sector initiative in Liberia. And if I recall his remarks correctly, he believes that Liberia can be on the precipice of a rebirth. It can be on the precipice, if you will, of a renaissance of economic development, educational achievement and infrastructure repair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, 14 years of civil war left Liberia in shambles. Nearly 200,000 civilians have died. Nearly one-third of the population, or 1 million citizens, have been displaced. And 300,000 have fled the country. Women are involved on all sides of the war from combat to slavery to rape. Child soldiers were involved in this terrible, horrific tragedy. Physical violence often accompanied the rape. A highly regarded survey of six selected Liberian counties revealed that roughly 7 percent of women have  been raped during the war, although female minors were frequently targeted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The war ended, and as I indicated, we now have a woman President. Liberian President, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, underlines this in her statement to the 2006 International Symposium on Sexual Violence. "In studies conducted in many of the countries of Liberia in 2004, a large percentage of women and girls reported that they were victims of various forms of violence."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This reprogramming of dollars will refocus on the need for developmental assistance that will be able to assist those who are making their first steps,  their first steps of achievement, both business-wise, education-wise and building up the confidence of women, men and families, turning child soldiers into constructive, giving adults, and participating with President Sirleaf's commitment to moving Liberia forward as a shining star on the continent. I  know they know how to do it, but we need to give them the extra added tools, and to be able to emphasize in this bill that their development is key.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to consider where Liberia has been, where Liberia is today, and where they will be 20 years from now. I believe in President Sirleaf and the commitment of Bob Johnson, the Clinton Foundation, and many others who have targeted the Liberian people and the Liberian Government as an achievable goal of economic developmental, educational, political democracy that can be again the shining star.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support this amendment that will provide this extra direction for developmental assistance in Liberia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk and I rise to speak in support of this amendment to <bill type="h" number="2764">H.R. 2764</bill>, the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Act of 2008. But before I do, let me commend Chairwoman LOWEY for her exceptional leadership in shepherding this bill through the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation she has so ably crafted is an indispensable measure in restoring America's international prestige and leadership position in the global community. Equally important, this legislation reflects what is good about America: its generosity, its concern for the less fortunate, its commitment to protecting the weak and uplifting the downtrodden, and the recognition that we live in an interdependent world. You will recall the wise counsel of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who said,</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It simply seeks to reallocate an additional $5 million for the Republic of Liberia out of the $365 million Development Assistance account. The net effect would be to increase developmental assistance to the Republic of Liberia to $35 million. Let me explain briefly why this would be a wise investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, fourteen years of civil war left Liberia in shambles. Nearly 200,000 civilians had died. Nearly a third of the population, or one million citizens, had been displaced, and 300,000 had fled the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Women were involved on all sides of the war from combat to slavery to rape. Physical violence often accompanied the rape. A highly regarded survey of six selected Liberian counties revealed that roughly 7 percent of women had been raped during the war. Moreover, female minors were frequently targeted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The war ended more than 4 years ago but the plight of Liberia's women is still problematic. Rape and domestic violence continue to plague Liberia. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf underlines this in her statement to the 2006 International Symposium on Sexual Violence in Conflict and Beyond: "In studies conducted in many of the counties of Liberia in 2004, a large percentage of women and girls reported that they were victims of various forms of violence and abuse. International organization  reports show that a large percentage of these women were raped."</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Mr. Chairman, traditional Liberian culture stigmatizes rape, so victims often choose to stay silent, hiding what they see as a shameful and incriminating experience from their family and townspeople. Until recently, Liberian government courts had no systems in place to assist rape survivors. Traditional culture around rape was one of shame for women and acceptance for men. But times are slowly changing. And it began with the historic election of President Sirleaf, Liberia's first female head  of state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Raised in Liberia and Harvard-educated, President Sirleaf began her long involvement with the Liberian government as its</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Assistant Minister of Finance during the 1970s. She went into exile after a military coup destabilized the country in 1980, but returned to Liberia to run for Senate 5 years later. When she was running for Senate, she was briefly imprisoned for speaking out against Liberia's leader at the time, Samuel Doe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You will remember how she described her capture and close encounter with rape when she addressed a joint session of the Congress on March 15, 2007: "In 1985, after challenging the military regime's failure to register my political party, I was put in jail with several university students who also challenged the military rule. This House came to our rescue with a resolution threatening to cut off aid to the country unless all political prisoners were released. Months later, I was put in jail  again, this time in a cell with 15 men. All of them were executed a few hours later. Only the intervention of a single soldier spared me from rape."</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Mr. Chairman, I would hope that my amendment would result in additional funding to secure women rights and prevent violence against women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Securing and protecting women's rights is something the Association of Female Liberian Lawyers fights for every day. AFELL, an organization of female lawyers based in Monrovia, is on a mission to educate and represent women nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded during the first civil war, 1989-1996, AFELL grew in prominence during the second conflict, which lasted from 1999 to 2003. In November 2000, with fighting still active, AFELL won a state patent to prosecute rape cases. Before this, Liberian law only allowed state lawyers to prosecute criminal cases. The patent represented a major success for AFELL.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was the first in a series of victories. AFELL later collaborated with the government to increase penalties for rape. Resulting legislation led to more punitive rape laws that call for 10 years to life imprisonment for rape.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Mr. Chairman, the Republic of Liberia has made great progress in recent years but still much work remains to be done. Listen again to the words of President Sirleaf: "In the campaign months, I traveled to every corner of our country. I trudged through mud in high boots, where roads did not exist or had deteriorated past repair. I surveyed ruined hospitals and collapsed clinics. I held meetings by candlelight, because there is no electricity anywhere--including the capital--except from private  generators. I was forced to drink water from creeks and un-sanitized wells all of which made me vulnerable to the diseases from which so many of our people die daily."</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Mr. Chairman, the women and children of Liberia want what we all want for those we love. They want to learn. They want to be safe from violence. They want to be healthy. They want the same chances that men have. They want to be literate. They want their work recognized. They want the right to inherit property. They want protection against rape. They want clean water that won't sicken and kill their children. They want a hopeful future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe my amendment will help hasten the day when these dreams are realized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, thank you this opportunity to discuss my amendment to <bill type="h" number="2764">H.R. 2764</bill>. I ask all members to support it. Again, I thank Chairwoman LOWEY for her fine work in bringing this exceptional legislation to the House.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE">
    <paragraph>Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and again, Mrs. Lowey, thank you for a well-drafted bill, but this is an area in which I have some concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my amendment would designate $50 million in Economic Support Funds for the Community Action Programs, also known as CAP in Iraq. The CAP program directly engages Iraqis in reconstructing their own communities while building a nationwide grassroots constituency for democracy. Typical CAP projects use both U.S. and Iraqi funds and resources to rebuild schools, repair water and sewage lines, build health clinics, as well as a host of other infrastructure and development projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The CAP agencies are Mercy Corps; IRD, International Relief and Development; CHF International; ACDI/VOCA Counterpart; and in the past, Save the Children. Since 2003, six of USAID's NGO partners have implemented this program in all 18 governorates of Iraq. In order to maintain the security of staff and win the trust of Iraqi communities, the implementers and USAID have largely run the program under the radar. As a result, not enough people are aware of the remarkable success story that CAP represents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here are just a few highlights: CAP has successfully managed more than 6,000 reconstruction and development projects and created more than 2.7 million days of employment and 34,000 long-term jobs with 43 percent of those jobs going to women, Iraqi women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A January 2005 audit report from the USAID regional inspector general, Baghdad, stated: "Based on tests performed on 89 statistically selected sample projects, the CAP achieved 98 percent of its intended outputs."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to read that again: "Based on tests performed on 89 statistically selected sample projects, the CAP achieved 98 percent of its intended outputs."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Communities are contributing between 15 and 25 percent of the value of each project. That is Iraqis contributing. This contribution is often in the form of labor, in-kind materials, or other provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my travels to Iraq, I have seen firsthand how the CAP program improves the lives of Iraqis and most importantly how it helps us accomplish our mission of creating a secure environment for the Iraqi people so democracy can prosper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be a terrible waste to turn our backs on such a great investment. In fact, this is exactly the time to nurture and build on the relationships CAP partners have forged with communities. Furthermore, CAP provides the foundation and the constituency at the community level that will help ensure the success of other State Department civil society programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CAP program has enjoyed strong support from the Appropriations Committee, Republicans and Democrats alike, in the past. An amendment we offered during last year's supplemental appropriations act to increase CAP funding by $10 million was accepted by the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee noted in its report last year that "CAP provides a vehicle for empowering communities, building community cohesion and providing evidence that the U.S. is committed to improving the lives of Iraqis."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are asking for $50 million to be designated within Economic Support Funds to ensure the agencies can expand and improve the valuable projects they've been implementing for the last several years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly rise in opposition to this amendment because, as I have explained to Mr. Shays, I believe this is a really critical program. I would love to work with you on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would provide $50 million in funding for Community Action Programs. There is no funding in this particular bill for Iraqi operations and reconstruction. As I explained to the gentleman, the reason there is no funding in this bill is because of the $2.8 billion in the supplemental and the $2.8 billion requested in September for the supplemental.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make it very clear that I agree with the gentleman that the Community Action Program and NGO partnership with USAID does really good work. In fact, CAP is the only program of its kind to operate outside the Green Zone in Iraq. I have been a strong supporter of their efforts. I have met with them repeatedly. I know of their good work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By working from the community level up and assisting Iraqi moderates who have eschewed sectarian and insurgent violence, the CAP partners directly engage Iraqis in reconstructing their own communities. They create employment. They build nationwide grass-roots constituency for democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress identified CAP as a priority when it appropriated $100 million specifically for CAP in the fiscal year 2006 supplemental. Additionally, we just provided $95 million for CAP in the 2000 supplemental. I want to make it clear to my good friend from Connecticut that we put the money in after I met personally with representatives of CAP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the important work that they are doing. I have spoken to the CAP partners. They agreed that they do not need any additional funding in the regular fiscal year 2008 bill. They tell me they have enough to continue operations. As difficult as it is there, they are continuing operations through fiscal year 2008 at the current pace of operation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They also noted that they worked very hard to stay under the radar in Iraq, which is what makes their great achievements possible. I want to make it clear that they have no interest, from my conversations with them, they don't want to be the foil in an Iraq funding debate. We have made it clear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to make it clear once again that the reason we are not providing additional funding and we cannot provide additional funding to the CAP in this bill is because of the $2.8 billion in the supplemental, the $2.8 billion that is being requested. The CAPs have made it clear they don't need the money now. They are operating under the radar. If we are providing zero funding for Iraq in this bill, they don't want to be part of this debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a partisan issue. They are doing very important work. It has nothing to do with any of the other debate on Iraq. It is what is needed now. There are tremendous needs around the world that we are trying to fill in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, again, with great respect for my good friend, Mr. Shays, we have worked together on many issues. I appreciate your concerns. I agree with your concerns, but not in this bill; and I look forward to continuing to work with you as we move ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I just want to say to you, there is no money in the 2008 budget, fiscal year 2008 budget. The challenge we have is that this is the one program, more than any others, that works. It shouldn't be tied to any benchmarks because implementing this program, expanding it actually, will make it easier for all those benchmarks to be realized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not trying to bring more attention to this program. I just think it needs to be funded and expanded and this is the vehicle to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400435" topic="DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, Mr. Shays has made a good case, and the Chair has made a good case for this. Without mentioning the groups, so we don't call any attention to them, we know the good work that they are doing. Mr. Shays lived with one of the groups for a period of time. You saw the schools they were building. So I am just concerned we are getting wrapped up into process that since nothing is in, we are not going to put things in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is something that would actually work and have success in Iraq from the civilian side. It would be a  great boost to have this in. So I strongly support the amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, in closing, just to address my good friend, Mr. Shays, I agree with everything you said. I agree with all the good work that the CAPs are doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why we appropriated $100 million and then another $95 million. But I want to make it clear, at least from my interaction from the CAPs, and I have had many discussions with the CAPs, they don't need the money now. They are operating under the radar. They are doing good work. And with the supplemental in 2008 that is coming up in September, they don't need the money now. They certainly welcome, if it is necessary, some additional funding to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from Connecticut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>

  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, just so the debate is a little more accurate, and we will see how the vote turns out whether I ask for a roll call vote or not, would it not be fair to say that they can live with the money they have, but they would like to have more and they could use more and do more with it? This is not a trick question, but I want to make sure for the record we don't make it seem like they have all that they need and can use well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the answer to that first question is yes, my second question would be, would it be the intent of the gentlewoman from New York to consider funding this program at an amount that will enable them to do at least what they are doing now in fiscal year 2008, and possibly more?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, and again with great respect to the gentleman from Connecticut, in my discussions with the CAP, they made it clear that they don't need money now. This is now June. We just passed a supplemental. In September there will be another supplemental. They are doing great work, and we both admire their work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the tremendous needs around the world, which I know you support, be it clean water or HIV-AIDS or peacekeeping, and we can go on and on, the CAP made it clear to me that they do not need the money now. Therefore, I must reluctantly oppose this amendment, because I do not want to take the money from any other urgent needs that exist in the world today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>If the gentlewoman will yield further, you are making me more concerned rather than less by your honesty. Could I ask the gentlewoman to respond to her intent on how she will be looking to fund this issue? This is the one program that is in fact working in Iraq. No one disputes it. We can dispute everything else, but not this. My interest is what your intentions are in the future as it relates not to Iraq in general or military forces, but the CAP agency program?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I would like to make it very clear to my good friend from Connecticut, just as they had $100 million and then an additional $95 million in the last supplemental, I certainly would intend to fund this outstanding program in the next supplemental that will be before us in September to continue their important work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays).</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400407" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, today I rise to ask support for a rather straightforward budget-neutral amendment that will meaningfully contribute to our campaign against international terrorism and serve the long-term national securities interests of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would provide an additional $75 million for basic education programs directly reaching Pakistani children through the U.S. Agency for International Development or provided through local and international nongovernmental organizations offering reliable and effective basic education services. In doing so, the amendment serves long-term United States national security interests by helping to give Pakistani children an educational alternative to extremist, jihadi-teaching madrassas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that the Chair of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee has agreed to accept this amendment. In their bill and committee report, the gentlewoman from New York and the rest of the members of the committee have recognized the importance of basic education assistance to our country's long-term national security interests. This amendment would complement and build off of those important efforts, and I thank the gentlewoman from New York for her willingness to work with me and accept my  amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commission described a "generational struggle" against international terrorism, stressing the importance that any offensive efforts "be accompanied by a preventative strategy." They also noted, "It is hard to overstate the importance of Pakistan in the struggle against Islamic terrorism" and urged the United States Government to support in Pakistan "a comprehensive effort that extends from military aid to support for better education." Unfortunately, we have not yet gone far  enough in that regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In December of 2005, the 9/11 Commission's Public Discourse Project gave the United States Government a D grade for not doing enough to support secular education. It noted, "United States assistance to Pakistan has not moved sufficiently beyond security assistance to include significant funding for education efforts." And just a few months ago, our own State Department concluded, "Pakistan remains a major source of Islamic extremism."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is precisely the time that we should be spending substantially more on education, where we should be broadening and deepening our relationship with the Pakistani people with aid that reaches directly into the Pakistani homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is an important first step in this endeavor by providing an extra $785 million infusion for basic education directly to Pakistani children, an extra $75 million that would come on top of Pakistani education funding already in the bill and what we have provided for before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment provides this additional $75 million for basic education by reprogramming existing funds within the Economic Support fund account; $50 million of the total $75 million will be drawn from that part of the Economic Support fund that provides direct budgetary support for the Pakistani Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last several years, the Pakistani Government has been receiving hundreds of millions of dollars per year in a cash transfer. This amendment would ensure that $50 million of those funds be reprogrammed to ensure they reach Pakistani children and not simply be handed over to the Pakistani Government without direction. The other $25 million of the $75 million total would come from the nonbudgetary support component of the Economic Support fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us hope to support the Pakistani people in their efforts to achieve a stable, prosperous and free nation. But our national security interests here are much more acute. Will we be safe over the next 5, 10 or 20 years as thousands of more young people learn jihad at extremist madrassas instead of learning real-world skills to become productive citizens in their communities and in our shared world?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When asked about this amendment, former 9/11 Commission Vice Chairman  Lee Hamilton responded, "Increased U.S. funding for basic education provided by the Tierney Pakistan Education Assistance Amendment will send a powerful message that we are committed to a better future for young Pakistanis and to supporting alternatives to radical Islamic education. Sending this kind of a message is hugely important to the future of America's relationship with the  people of Pakistan and our efforts to combat radical Islam."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is past time to heed the 9/11 Commission's warning by fighting terrorism at its source, by stopping the process of extremism before it can begin, by helping the children of Pakistan to have an alternative to extreme madrassas. That should be at the core of our long-term national security strategy, that is what this amendment is all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again I thank the gentlewoman from New York for accepting this amendment. I look forward to working with her to see that this additional funding for basic education programs directly reaching Pakistani children is retained in conference.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to accept this amendment. I thank the gentleman for his interest in basic education in Pakistan. As the gentleman knows, I have been a firm believer in basic education for a long time. The bill includes a total of $750 million for basic education programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman recently went to Pakistan. I had the privilege of going to Pakistan and visited the earthquake zones, and in fact I had the privilege of opening a school in the earthquake zone. These beautiful young girls looked at me and said, can you send us science teachers? Can you send us computers? We know this experience can be replicated thousands of times around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I really do appreciate the gentleman's commitment to basic education, and I look forward to working with the gentleman and accept his amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Cardoza) for the purpose of a colloquy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlelady from New York for her work with me on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, by way of brief background, there is a strong and vibrant minority community of Christians in Iraq. Some the oldest Christians in the world are these various sects: The Assyrian Church of the East, the Assyrian Church of the East Ancient, the Assyrian Evangelical, the Syriac Orthodox, the Syriac Catholic, the Coptic Church, the Armenian Catholic, the Armenian Evangelical, the Armenian Orthodox, and the Chaldean have their origins in Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries such as  Iran, Turkey and Syria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like other ethnic minorities residing in the Middle East, throughout their history these various sects have been used as pawns by major powers in the region. Unfortunately, their Christian faith has made them targets and they frequently have been subjected to harassment and violence throughout the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, the regime of Saddam Hussein was particularly brutal in their treatment of Christians. Because of their religion and because the majority of Christians opposed Saddam's regime, many of their leaders were assassinated and subjected to arbitrary detention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The war in Iraq exacerbated this situation and further endangers the faith of this group. It is estimated that as many as 40,000 Iraqi Christians, 5 percent of the faithful, have left the country since the war has begun. While Iraqi Christians make up just 3 percent of the overall population, reports are that Christians make up more than 20 percent of the refugee exodus to Syria, and there are mounting fears that if Iraq becomes an Islamic theocracy, the exodus will accelerate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My congressional district, the 18th District of California, happens to be home to a large Assyrian population. I have heard the horror stories from some in my district, and I am committed to ensuring that the interests of the Assyrians and the broader Christian community are well protected in the new Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have taken numerous steps to protect the rights of the minority. In particular I have written a letter on the subject to Secretary Rice and have implored her to use all means available to ensure that the rights of this group are respected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To further enhance our ability to protect these people, it is my understanding that there is report language in this bill which urges that $10 million in the recently enacted supplemental be targeted towards helping the Christian community in Iraq. I want to work with the chairwoman and the rest of the members of the committee to ensure that this money goes for its intended purpose of protecting this community and does not get diverted to other issues.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from California (Mr. Cardoza) for bringing this important matter to the attention of the committee. This type of government-sponsored terrorism was a hallmark of Saddam Hussein's rule and cannot continue. It was endemic. Unfortunately, it seems that the practice continues, and I continue to worry that our assistance may not be benefiting the intended recipients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I too am concerned about the plight of the Christian minority, and I am dedicated to using whatever tools we have available to ensure their rights are given due consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, I want to note for my colleagues that the recent supplemental included a requirement for a report on the ethnic and geographic distribution of the United States assistance programs reaching the Nineveh Plain region, which should give us a clearer picture of the situation facing Iraqi Christians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to assure my friend that I, and I know my ranking member, who cares passionately about these issues, will work closely with the Congressman to ensure that this $10 million does go for its intended purpose of protecting the Christian minority in Iraq.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her help on this issue and for her agreement to work towards ensuring that the money goes to alleviate the suffering of the Christian community in Iraq. This community has lived in this part of the world for over 1,000 years, and we must do our part to ensure that they live there for 1,000 more.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400435" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. Congresswoman ANNA ESHOO is interested in this and a lot of others, and I thank the Chair for accepting the Kirk amendment in the full committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I looked for you yesterday. What I wanted to ask you to do was to offer an amendment on the floor, and I know the gentlewoman would have accepted it, of another $100,000, or $1 million, for the Chaldean Christians, and get a roll call vote on it; because colloquies are colloquies, but a roll call vote is a roll call vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AID has failed to address this issue. We have asked them a number of times. They tell us that we can't be targeting with regard to certain ethnic groups, and it has never been a satisfactory answer. So it is too late now, but it would have been a good thing to do. In fact, this Congress and this government, we have abandoned the Christians in the Middle East. We have pretty much walked away and the Christian community in the Middle East is declining.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So you are on to something, and hopefully you can find a way in another bill or in the supplemental perhaps to offer to work with the gentlewoman to have an amendment, and then you offer an added $100,000 or $1 million or whatever you think is appropriate, and then ask for a roll call vote so the entire Congress is on record, because you are right on target.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank you, and we will work with you and help you in any way possible. But a roll call vote of 435-0 would send a message to the AID people that they would have to face and focus on.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to assure my good friend from California, and, of course, my ranking member, that we together will make it clear that this is an urgent issue, and the amendment in the committee validated the urgency of the issue. I know we will continue to work together to address this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for bringing this up, and, of course, I respect the interest and passion of my ranking member. We will be following up, and there will be attention given to this issue.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400435" topic="">

  <speaking speaker="400065" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman would yield briefly, I would say I did look for the gentleman on the floor yesterday as well, but we must have missed each other in our search. I thank the gentleman for his comments in the Rules Committee where I raised this issue initially. I look forward to working with the gentleman in the future. I will look for opportunities, together we will look for opportunities, to send a continuing message that this population is important, not just to the Middle East,  but to this country as well, and it is important for us to assist and invest in this community.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield to my good friend, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks) for an important statement.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400271" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I don't have any amendment at the desk, but I do wish to rise in support of the 2008 State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Act and to commend the committee, particularly the chairwoman from New York, for the fine work that has been done to get the bill to this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to bring attention to a very important aspect of the bill: funding for trade capacity building. This bill raises the Federal appropriation level to $214 million. That is $87 million more than the administration requested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obviously there are many different points of view on trade in this body, but I think all of us can agree that we must do everything possible to enable developing countries to facilitate trade with the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most people think of trade infrastructure projects when they think of trade capacity. But facilitating trade goes well beyond that. These funds will help developing countries with labor and environmental law enforcement and provide technical assistance for better trade access in remote areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trade capacity assistance is a relatively new tool in the trade arena, but it has recently played an important role in the implementation of trade and will continue to play a critical role as we consider several free trade agreements with developing countries that are eligible to receive capacity building from our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the chairwoman for maintaining the commitment to trade capacity funds in recent agreements, and I hope to work closely with the committee on follow-up and oversight of trade capacity funds, past and in the present.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hopefully, in the near future, we will have the opportunity to consider this on the floor with countries such as Peru, Panama and Colombia. All of these nations need trade capacity assistance, but Colombia is arguably the country with the most intense and persistent challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working closely with the committee and USAID to see that we dedicate some of the increased funds in this bill to help Colombia meet critical needs, like assistance for its Fiscalia, the Office of the Attorney General. The Fiscalia bears the overwhelming responsibility of continuing the progress towards security and peace in Colombia, with investigations of murders and kidnappings, particularly those of labor leaders, and managing the legal process of the demobilization of paramilitaries  and the FARC. The Fiscalia needs as much support as we can offer it if it is going to expeditiously carry out the hundreds of investigations and legislative demands that it must meet as an independent agency of justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues who share my concern over violence in Colombia, particularly in remote areas populated by African Colombians and attacks against labor leaders, will support the 2008 Foreign Operations bill and join me in calling for trade capacity funds specifically dedicated to those countries who are cooperating with us to make strides toward a more secure hemisphere.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend from New York for bringing attention to these important issues. As you know, the former Chair of this committee, Mr. Kolbe, has been a leader on trade, and continues to share with us the importance of trade as we move forward in this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank you very much for focusing on his very important legacy. He was a great partner for me working together on this committee, and I also appreciate your mentioning Colombia and the fact that we changed the balance of funding in this bill, putting more resources in the Fiscalia. When I was there, it was clear to me that they didn't have enough people to enforce the law to go after the narcotraffickers, so this was an important area, in addition to increasing funding for interdiction. Justice,  rule of law, interdiction, and funding for the Afro-Colombians, and we know there has been a tremendous need. Thank you for your work. I look forward to working together. I know that my colleagues realize how important these issues are as well.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400396" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished chairwoman of the Foreign Ops appropriations bill about the need for increased funding for the United States contribution to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization called CTBTO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had planned to offer an amendment to fund the CTBTO at least to the administration's request of $18 million for fiscal year 2008; but I would just like to make a few points for the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, the administration's fiscal year 2008 budget request calls for $18 million for the U.S. contribution to the CTBTO. Unfortunately, the Foreign Operations appropriations bill would shift $8 million of the administration's already inadequate request to another account, leaving only $10 million for U.S. funding for CTBTO test ban monitoring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration's request already falls well short of what is necessary to make up for past funding shortfalls that threaten to slow or stop the construction and operation of the test ban treaty organization's international monitoring system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2002, the Bush administration unilaterally decided not to support the U.S. portion, approximately $800,000 per year, of the on-site inspection component of the CTBTO verification activities. The administration, which does not support ratification and entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, argues that because the on-site inspection will only be available upon the entry into force of the treaty, the United States should not contribute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For fiscal year 2006, the Bush administration requested and Congress approved only $14.4 million for the CTBTO, which was $7 million short of the $22 million assessed by the organization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The continuing resolution covering most fiscal year 2007 spending set U.S. funding for the CTBTO at the fiscal year 2006 level, which was $9 million short of the United States $23.4 million assessment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Compounding the problem last month, the Bush administration unilaterally decided to obligate only $10  million of the $14.4 million appropriated by Congress. As a result, the U.S. is now in arrears to a total of $28.3 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are the single largest contributor to CTBTO, and our shortfalls will have a significant impact. The United States failure to pay its share will directly affect the CTBTO's ability to complete construction and certify for use the remaining stations in the international monitoring system, including those in more remote and strategic regions such as Turkmenistan, which lies just north of Iran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure that the gentlewoman from New York (Chairman Lowey) shares my deep concern that the United States is underfunding the CTBTO as the danger of Iran's nuclear program grows as these fundings continue to deplete and we are not able to keep up with our obligations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unless Congress increases funding for the U.S. contribution, these shortfalls that have accumulated over the last 7 years will continue to undermine the effort to complete a global monitoring network and conduct data analysis designed to detect and deter nuclear weapons test explosions.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased that my good friend from California brought this issue to our attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I really want to thank you for your work on CTBTO, and I agree with you that the United States should show leadership and pay our full share of obligations that it owes to the CTBTO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill tries to draw balance between the various programs funded within the nonproliferation antiterrorism account, but I understand the concerns my friend has raised and these are concerns of the committee. There are many members of the committee who are working very hard on this issue, and it is my intention to continue to work with you as the bill moves through the process.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="GLOBAL HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, United Nations program on HIV/AIDS report estimates that there are 40 million people infected with HIV/AIDS worldwide, and like everyone else, I am deeply saddened by this reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I am also filled with hope because recent evidence indicates that the current prevention strategy is helping to produce behavioral change that has significantly decreased people's risk of contracting this deadly disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current HIV/AIDS prevention strategy was carefully crafted in the PEPFAR authorization bill to reflect a balanced approach, and the good news is that this balanced approach is working.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The PEPFAR authorization bill, which became law in 2003, included a provision that required one-third of the 20 percent for prevention funding, that is approximately 7 percent of the total PEPFAR funds, to be spent on abstinence and fidelity programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to the implementation of this spending directive, the U.S. promoted an unbalanced condoms-only approach. The U.S. remains the largest distributor of condoms in the world. But for the first time the behavior factor is getting real attention under the current program rules. And the result: falling HIV/AIDS prevalence rates in 7 of the 15 focus countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current prevention strategy is based on the comprehensive ABC model, first established in Uganda, developed by Uganda. The ABC model stands for A, abstinence; B, be faithful; C, condoms. A comprehensive, balanced approach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After implementation of this model in Uganda, the number of young males age 15 to 24 reporting premarital sex decreased from 60 percent in 1989 to 23 percent in 1995. For females, the decline was 53 percent to 16 percent. The program actually helped change the behavior in women and men, a fact I hope my colleagues take seriously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opponents of this approach claim that behavioral change is unrealistic. Dr. Edward Green, a researcher at Harvard University, was an opponent of the ABC model and in particular of abstinence until he saw what happened in Uganda. He testified before the Energy and Commerce Committee saying: "Many of us in the AIDS and public health communities did not believe that abstinence or delay and faithfulness were realistic goals. It now seems we were wrong."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only has Uganda seen a society transformed by behavioral change, we can now add Kenya, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Namibia, Tanzania, and Zambia to the list of countries that are experiencing a decrease in HIV/AIDS prevalence rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Experts continue to testify to the fact that behavioral change continues to be the key indicator of HIV/AIDS prevention. Yet for some reason, some of my colleagues have decided to make a crucial provision of this successful strategy optional. This crucial provision ensures that the "abstinence" and "be faithful" components are incorporated into the approach. Never mind the fact that PEPFAR is expected to be reauthorized later this year, and never mind the fact that the reauthorization might  be the more appropriate forum to debate this critical component that was agreed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of my colleagues argue that we need a comprehensive approach, but I remind them that abstinence and fidelity education are fundamental to the comprehensive ABC approach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of my colleagues argue that we need an approach that saves lives. I remind them that the ABC model, with the A and the B spending requirement intact, is continuing to save more and more lives. In countries that have relied predominantly on condom distribution, HIV/AIDS prevalence rates have not improved. Meanwhile, countries that promote behavioral change have seen significant improvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, a balanced, evidence-based approach is essential if we are going to effectively fight HIV/AIDS in Africa. The current policy is the balanced approach. It is the evidence-based approach. It is the approach that is working. Why change what works?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote for my amendment and keep abstinence and fidelity in the AIDS program, and in doing so, to vote for an approach that is saving lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, despite the best efforts of our prevention programs, the HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to grow. In 2006, 4.3 million people were infected with the virus; and for every new treatment patient in 2006, six additional people became infected with HIV. If we do not slow the pandemic, treatment costs alone in 2010 could be as high as $11 billion. Unless this trend is reversed, global efforts to expand treatment will falter and our global effort to address the pandemic will fail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why it is so critical to maximize the effectiveness of the $5.062 billion for HIV/AIDS programs provided in this bill and make sure that our prevention programs work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recently released Institute of Medicine report entitled, "PEPFAR Implementation," stated: "The earmark has greatly limited the ability of country teams to develop and implement comprehensive prevention programs that are well integrated with each other and with testing, care, and treatment programs." These congressionally mandated funding restrictions are hampering our overall prevention efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Therefore, and I want to make it very clear to my colleague, the bill allows the President to provide funding for HIV/AIDS prevention at his discretion. It does not change the underlying PEPFAR law, nor does it require that the President change the amount of funding for any particular prevention programs. In fact, it doesn't require the President to change the programs at all. The language simply provides flexibility to design the most effective prevention programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Effective HIV/AIDS prevention initiatives must be designed to respond to the local social and cultural conditions. These efforts should include all available options, including abstinence programs, comprehensive prevention programs, condom distribution, and medical interventions such as male circumcision and mother-to-child prevention programs to ensure that we use every tool at our disposal to stop this deadly disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that the only solution to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS is expanded and effective prevention programs. Our bill language again provides the administration with the flexibility to respond to the ever-changing pandemic in the most effective ways without the restrictions of arbitrary numerical targets.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412213" topic="GLOBAL HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts), and in support of this evidence-based approach to reducing the spread of HIV and AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The AIDS epidemic in Africa is a serious problem that demands serious results. However, I also had the privilege of seeing firsthand the success of Uganda's ABC program when I traveled to Uganda a couple of years ago to visit my daughter who's a missionary there and also a health educator dealing specifically with HIV/AIDS. Also meeting with who has now become adopted into our family, Mama Nabali, who is a young woman with three children who has HIV as a result of behavior issues related specifically  to a husband who was unfaithful in many, many ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been interesting to note that in Uganda as well as other countries that are now using the ABC program authorized and pushed by the First Lady and the President, President Museveni of Uganda, in each of those cases there is a significant decline in reported numbers of sexual partners, that's the behavior portion of it, and a significant decline in the numbers of unmarried youth who are sexually active, which is the abstinence portion of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Authorizing legislation that requires 33 percent of prevention funds to be spent in abstinence-until-marriage programming is the best way to address this problem because it's a proven, successful method of reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS. There is growing evidence that partner reduction is the single most important factor in reducing HIV/AIDS prevalence rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the PEPFAR Third Report to Congress, "Of the countless developments taking place in the global fight against the AIDS pandemic, perhaps the single most important in recent years is the growing number of nations in which there is clear evidence of declining HIV prevalence as a result of changes in sexual behavior."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, no country with a generalized epidemic that has relied on condom prevention alone has reported a decline in HIV/AIDS prevalence rates. Because studies have shown that the abstinence-until-marriage method is producing the best results, I urge my colleagues to consider the merits of the Pitts amendment and support this important and, need I say, life-changing and lifesaving legislation.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="GLOBAL HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE">
    <paragraph>Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to urge my colleagues to oppose the Pitts amendment that would strike the underlying language that provides flexibility to the President on designing his HIV/AIDS programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, Congress and the President came together to establish the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative. Five years ago, the world was optimistic that we could, with additional funding, start to turn the pandemic around. As we have heard, success has not been as easy as we would have hoped, and over 4 million people were newly infected last year. That is why, in addition to increasing the amount of money we are spending to combat HIV/AIDS, we must take every effort to ensure that we are spending money  as wisely as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairwoman's bill contains language which gives the President maximum flexibility. There is no empirical data to my knowledge which supports the abstinence-only earmark in P.L. 108-25, the original PEPFAR authorizing legislation. The earmark calls for one-third of all prevention funds to be spent on abstinence-only until marriage. No one has ever explained the rationale for that figure. The provision of flexibility to the President to determine how much money to spend on abstinence-only is  way overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote against the Pitts amendment and to support the chairperson in this endeavor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400427" topic="GLOBAL HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Pitts amendment. I am concerned with the change in the abstinence policy in the PEPFAR budget to permissive authority for the administration to give grants to abstinence-based programs. I fear that this is a setback to the work we are doing overseas with AIDS relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The best way to stop AIDS is to encourage people to abstain from sexual behavior outside of marriage. Last July, southern African AIDS experts and officials listed, and I'm quoting here, reducing multiple concurrent partnerships as their number one priority for preventing the spread of HIV.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I used to treat AIDS patients. I used to practice infectious disease. The reason AIDS exploded through the gay community in this country in the late seventies and the early eighties was because of this phenomenon, having multiple concurrent sexual partners. And the reason Uganda, and you're going to hear Uganda quoted over and over again, was successful in lowering their AIDS incidence from 18 percent to 6 percent, and there was very little foreign aid going in the country at the time they did  this, is because they established an education program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People are rising on the floor today acting like there is no money for anything other than abstinence education. This is a very modest component of the bill. We have a lot of money for prevention. We have money for mother-to-child prevention. We are simply requiring that a third of the money go to what I think is the most cost-effective venue that we could be using.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would highly encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. I believe right now under the current  law, the President has the authority to waive this requirement if the country team asks for it and as I understand some countries have and they have waived the authority. I believe that this language that they changed in PEPFAR is authorizing and this should have been left to the authorizing debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the Pitts amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the language in the bill provides the President flexibility, not mandates. The gentleman's amendment seems to be more interested in bean-counting than saving and treating those with HIV/AIDS. Is it more important to make sure that 33 cents out of every dollar, according to the gentleman's amendment, go to abstinence or that we give the President some flexibility if, that is if, he needs it?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that HIV/AIDS prevention programs must be targeted to the group that we are seeking to influence and when abstinence programs may be appropriate for some groups, including the very young. I want to raise to my colleagues' attention that the underlying language in the bill that provides flexibility enjoys broad support from groups that are working on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a letter from the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatrics AIDS Foundation urging a "no" vote on the Pitts amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a letter from CARE, one of the world's leading NGOs providing AIDS care and prevention services, urging a "no" vote on the Pitts amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a letter from the General Board of Church and Society of the United Methodist Church urging a "no" vote on the Pitts amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues and their counsel and to vote "no" on the Pitts amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, Mr. Chairman, I would like to quote the distinguished ranking Republican member who said this on the floor last night:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I believe this bill has the potential to do a lot of good, and I want to say that this bill will help save a lot of lives not only here but around the world. This is the work of the Lord. And I know Members are going to come down here and they're going to be against this bill. And I hope that we can change some of the things to prevent a veto, but this bill eventually when it passes, and it will pass, assuming it will be vetoed, is really about feeding the poor, the hungry, the naked and the  sick. Almost a better title would be the Matthew 25 bill. So it has the potential to do a lot of good and I hope to work with the chairwoman to ensure the State Department has what it needs to do these things."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Matthew 25 is very clear, Mr. Chairman:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then the king will say to those on his right, "Come you who are blessed by my father, take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came after me."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then the righteous will answer him, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see a stranger and invite you in? Or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison or did we go visit you?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The king will reply, "I will tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these, my brethren, you did it unto me."</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400640" topic="GLOBAL HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in favor of the Pitts amendment. This amendment will save lives. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, commonly known as PEPFAR, is the largest bilateral foreign assistance program dedicated to mitigating the HIV/AIDS crisis worldwide. The plan places special emphasis on the 15 countries in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean which account for approximately 50 percent of the world's HIV infections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the U.S. is to remain the world's leader in saving lives from the devastation of AIDS, it's time to look at the track record and see what works well. Demographic and health surveys show that HIV/AIDS prevalence rates in at least 7 of the 15 PEPFAR focus countries is declining. Countries such as Uganda, Zambia and Senegal have success stories to showcase and something to teach us. In these nations and others experiencing declines in the prevalence of HIV/AIDS, it is through indigenous programming  that respects the local cultural milieu and social norms that figure prominently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Uganda, for example, prevalence rates among pregnant women fell from approximately 20 percent in 1991 to 6 percent in the year 2000. Between 1991 and 1998, HIV prevalence rates among 15- to 19-year-olds fell by 75 percent, from approximately 21 percent to 5 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While causal factors behind the prevalence declines are complex and should not be oversimplified, it is clear that the success stories in Uganda, Zambia, Senegal and elsewhere all incorporate the same common denominator, an emphasis on abstinence and fidelity, as critical elements in successful interventions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>As it stands, this appropriations bill would potentially reverse the most significant element of this success by diminishing the emphasis on abstinence and fidelity. This issue is much too serious to prevent the outright dismissal of compelling clinical evidence that in-country programming emphasizing abstinence and fidelity can effectively reduce the prevalence of HIV and AIDS.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400259" topic="GLOBAL HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge my colleagues to oppose the Pitts amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HIV/AIDS is devastating Africa and other parts of the developing world. We all share that. We share that knowledge. We can be proud that the United States is leading the way in addressing the global AIDS pandemic. We are providing support for millions of people through treatment, care and prevention programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we need to take a very practical approach, and the bill before us does that by including the language that gives the President flexibility to implement prevention programs that fit the country's current AIDS pandemic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought it was very compelling to hear the story that was just shared on the floor by my Republican colleague about how a wife had become infected, not because of her behavior, but because of her husband's behavior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly concerned about the 40 percent of new HIV/AIDS infections in youth between the ages of 15 and 24. Women and girls make up 60 percent of all the infections, and 76 percent of the infections among those are between the ages of 15 and 24. Now, abstinence could be an option, but we know that marriage is not a protective factor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Listen carefully to this: over the next 10 years, more than 100 million girls in the developing countries will be married before their 18th birthday, some as young as age 14, mostly to older men, often against their will. These are forced child brides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These girls will have a significantly higher rate of HIV infection than their peers who are sexually active and their unmarried peers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should give these young girls the opportunity to protect themselves, to save their own lives. I believe that we must make sure that our prevention programs address their needs and provide alternatives. For these young girls and women, abstinence is just not an option. They need programs that provide them with full information to protect themselves. We, in Congress, must do all that we can to stop child marriage; but, in the meantime, we need to protect these young women.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H6865]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400380" topic="GLOBAL HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Pitts amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an original cosponsor of the President's $15 billion, 5-year law to combat HIV/AIDS in Africa, I rise in strong opposition to the language in the bill that undermines and dismisses the successful HIV/AIDS prevention spending requirement in the PEPFAR legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where the epidemic has spread among the general population, the only successful evidence-based approach to HIV/AIDS prevention is that which emphasizes abstinence before marriage and faithfulness in relationships, and, lastly, where necessary, condoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The success of the ABC approach depends on the proper balance between these three elements. The spending requirement is necessary to attain that balance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The vast majority of PEPFAR's focus countries have generalized epidemics; and those that have emphasized A and B, abstinence and being faithful programming, have experienced significant increases in the number of youth and adults who are either abstaining or being mutually faithful, and, at the same time, they have seen significant drops in those countries, in the percentage of their population infected with HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Examples of countries that have aggressively promoted abstinence and fidelity at the national level, backed by real resources, and have experienced decreased HIV rates include Uganda, Senegal, Jamaica, Thailand, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Dominican Republic and Kenya.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the other hand, no country with a generalized epidemic that has relied primarily on condom promotion has reported a decline in HIV rates. Southern Africa is a tragic example of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Washington Post on March 2 pointed out that "researchers increasingly attribute the resilience of HIV in Botswana, and in Southern Africa generally, to the high incidence of multiple sexual relationships ..... [Western AIDS experts] brought not just ideas, but money, and soon billboards in Botswana touted condoms. Schoolchildren sang about them. Cadres of young women demonstrated how to roll them out. The anti-AIDS partnership between the ..... Gates Foundation and drugmaker Merck budgeted</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As indicated in The Washington Post report, those who are considered AIDS experts in the West, including some of those who directed U.S. prevention funding prior to PEPFAR, imposed their narrow-minded condom promotion mentality on Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The PEPFAR coordinator, on the other hand, Ambassador Mark Dybul, testified last fall that the 33 percent prevention spending requirement "has helped support PEPFAR's field personnel in appropriately broadening the range of prevention efforts ..... In addition, the directive has helped PEPFAR to align itself with the strategies of the host nations, of which ABC is a key element."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a letter to the editor of Lancet, June 2006, the Minister of Health of Namibia noted that PEPFAR support for AB, abstinence and faithful, is needed to ensure the balance of the ABC programs that Namibia seeks. That is because, he goes on to say, other international donors support only condoms but not abstinence or being faithful programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, let me say that even with the spending requirement, the United States remains by far the largest condom distributor in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If our goal here is to save lives by implementing the strongest evidence-based prevention programs possible, we should be at least maintaining, and I would suggest increasing, the percentage of funding directed to abstinence and to being faithful programs. It works, it has proven that it works, and I support the Pitts amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for yielding to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I oppose the Pitts amendment. I support strongly the attempt by the subcommittee to give the President flexibility to implement prevention programs that fit the countries' current AIDS epidemic. I salute the President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief. I have been to Africa, Uganda, and Tanzania to see how the program works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone I spoke with pleaded with us to make sure that there was more emphasis on not A, B, but on C, condoms. Young children were asking that this be a factor in their schools. They said sex is going to happen no matter what you say. No matter what you say about abstinence or be faithful, it's going to happen. It is particularly disconcerting to think that someone who has chosen one partner and loves that partner, not knowing that that partner has been unfaithful, and, in fact, has AIDS, transmitting  that disease to, in most cases, a young woman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This makes eminent sense. I would like to think that we could get our religious beliefs out of this issue, not talking practically, but talking realistically. If you want to prevent deaths, you need to allow more condoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you want to save lives, you need to allow more condoms. If you want to prevent pregnancies, you need to allow more condoms. If you don't want so much interest on other things like whether there should be abortion, you need to have condoms.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Pitts amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all there is the flexibility; there is ability to waive. I hope Mr. Pitts will cover that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me read you what Ambassador Mark Dybul said. He said recent data from Kenya, Zimbabwe and urban Haiti show decline in HIV prevalence. A new study has concluded that these reductions and prevalence do not simply represent the natural course of these nations' epidemics, but can only be explained by changes in sexual behavior. This demonstrates the power of behavior changes to save lives and the importance of support for effective behavior change intervention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If people from my old neighborhood back in southwest Philadelphia heard this debate that the Congress was debating "faithful" in this, is it a good idea or a bad idea, they would say, what is going on?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Mr. Pitts said, I would argue too that he is right. I think Biblical faithfulness is a Biblical principle. Faithfulness is a very good principle. Does anyone disagree? Now we are debating abstinence? We are saving lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So there is flexibility. So there is a fake argument here. There is the ability to waive; and what we are doing here, we could talk about different things, they are underlying agendas. We are talking about basically are we going to save lives. Are we going to save lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will stipulate that Mark Dybul has forgotten more about this than this Congress knows. Because of that, I will urge an "aye" vote for the Pitts amendment to save lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to my friend from Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="GLOBAL HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, there is flexibility in the existing program. Countries can apply for a waiver. Every country that has applied has received a waiver. Our friends say that all they want to do is provide flexibility and more condoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, for 20 years of fighting AIDS, the bureaucrats who run these programs tried the same approach over and over again. It never worked. When Uganda came up with a comprehensive approach that would, they still opposed it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the buck stops here in Congress, and we told them in 2003 to do what works, and it's working. Without this amendment, this bill will allow them to go back to the failed policies of the passed. So many on the other side are saying we need to listen to the other experts on the ground; we need to follow their advice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's true. They even raise this point with the Centers for Disease Control in a letter signed by several of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, including the distinguished subcommittee chairwoman, Mrs. Lowey. That letter highlighted the report that was written by the world's leading HIV/AIDS experts, was endorsed by more than 100 leaders from 36 countries, people like the President of Uganda, people like Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the HIV/AIDS director of the World Health  Organization, researchers from Johns Hopkins and other leading medical institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Allow me to quote from what these people, the experts, are saying about what's working to reduce AIDS prevalence: "When targeting young people for those who have not started sexual activity, the first priority should be to encourage abstinence or delay of sexual onset, hence emphasizing risk avoidance as the best way to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, as well as unwanted pregnancies." Abstinence, behavior change, that is what the experts are stressing. I agree, the experts  know best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are saying that a comprehensive approach that includes behavioral change is crucial to winning the fight against AIDS.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I submit for the Record the copies of the letters and the statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, January 7, 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR DR. GERBERDING: On November 27, 2004, the Lancet published a statement entitled "The Time Has Come for Common Ground on Preventing Sexual Transmission of HIV." Signed by more than 100 religious, political, health and scientific leaders from across the developed and developing world, this statement called for an end to "polarizing debate" and urged the international community "to unite around an inclusive evidence-based approach to slow the spread of sexually transmitted HIV."  We are writing to ask whether you support this statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The statement describes key elements of successful HIV prevention. These include:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1. Ensuring prevention activities are grounded in the science of epidemiology, supported at the local level, and respectful of human rights;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2. Promoting abstinence among those young people who are not yet sexually active, encouraging mutual monogamy among sexually active adults, and helping individuals who engage in high-risk activities to stop;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>3. Encouraging correct and consistent condom use among individuals who are engaging in high-risk activities and those who are sexually active with a partner whose HIV status is unknown;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>4. Expanding prevention programs for young people both in and out of school, supporting parents "in communicating their values and expectations about sexual behavior"; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>5. Employing community-based approaches that involve religious organizations, women's and men's organizations, care groups, youth organizations, health workers, local media, and traditional and governmental leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The statement also notes that expanding access to services for testing, counseling and treatment of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, preventing mother-to-child transmission, and enhancing access to family planning services are all essential in order to achieve the prevention, care and treatment objectives of the President's Emergency Plan for  AIDS and other global initiatives. It endorses continuing review of potential interventions such as microbicides, new antibiotic treatments, and vaccines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The statement was written by several of the world's leading HIV experts, and endorsed by more than 100 leaders in the fight against AIDS from 36 countries across a range of disciplines. Notable endorsers include: Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni, Archbishop Desmond Tutu of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa, UN Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa Stephen Lewis, and HIV/AIDS Director at the World Health Organization Jim Kim.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The statement has also been endorsed by representatives from the World Bank; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; and the heads of HIV/AIDS programs in several countries including Ethiopia, India, Jamaica, and Uganda. Leaders and representatives from major faith- and community-based nongovernmental organizations from the United States and around the world also back the statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the broad international and domestic support for the Lancet statement and the importance of collaboration in AIDS prevention efforts worldwide, we would like to know whether you, as a key leader in this administration in combating HIV/AIDS, support this statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We would appreciate a response by January 24, 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>June 18, 2007. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: We are writing on behalf of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) and Catholic Relief Services (CRS) to express deep concern regarding two provisions in the State/Foreign Operations appropriations bill, which the full House may soon debate. First, the bill would nullify the current 7 percent allocation (one-third of HIV and AIDS prevention funds) for abstinence-before-marriage programs in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). These  programs have proven to be very effective in Africa as part of a larger strategy that focuses on overall behavior change. We consider it unwise to abandon this strategy through the Appropriations process and urge you to support any effort to reverse this provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other fundamental defect is language in Section 622 rescinding the Mexico City Policy, which prevents U.S. family planning assistance from being channeled through groups that perform and promote abortion as family planning. On this issue we urge you to follow the counsel by our Bishops' Conference offered in a companion letter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Catholic Church is deeply committed to U.S. leadership on the issue of HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment. At home and around the world, and particularly through the experience of Catholic Relief Services in 12 of the 15 PEPFAR focus countries and many others, principally in Africa, the Church is deeply involved in offering life-saving help to people threatened by HIV and AIDS. This is not about ideology; it is about saving lives. In this common effort, we would urge the following steps  to advance the U.S. commitment to address the spread of HIV and AIDS: Do not abandon the consensus that underpins U.S. leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PEPFAR, at its heart, is about coming to the aid of some of our most vulnerable sisters and brothers. PEPFAR legislation was carefully negotiated and reflects a consensus on how best to proceed and on what works in HIV and AIDS prevention. By setting aside the requirement that 33 percent of prevention funding focus on "abstinence-before-marriage," Congress is summarily rejecting sound evidence and experience of what actually works in reducing HIV and AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Abandoning this approach through the Appropriations process, rather than through the process of reauthorizing PEPFAR, is also unwise, premature and counter-productive. This is an important issue that requires careful consideration of evidence and experience accumulated over a period of years. We and others on the front lines look forward to making our full case about the effectiveness of abstinence, behavior change, and partner reduction as ways to help save lives through the regular authorization  process of hearings and deliberation. This is where decisions should be made in the interest of sound policy and on behalf of the lives and dignity of those who are most affected by HIV and AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>USCCB and CRS were major supporters of the PEPFAR initiative when it was first announced in 2003. Since then, we have been actively engaged in education and advocacy to support major new investments in the U.S. commitment to fight the global pandemic. As we prepare for the reauthorization of  PEPFAR legislation, attempts to abandon the current approach will seriously threaten consensus needed to expand U. S. leadership on this issue. It would be tragic  if efforts to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We strongly urge the Committee to retain designated funding for prevention of sexually transmitted HIV through abstinence and fidelity education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PEPFAR included a 7 percent allocation (one-third of HIV and AIDS prevention funds) for abstinence-before-marriage programs. The State/Foreign Operations appropriations bill abandons this commitment, even though there is a global shortage of funding available for this critical and effective method for preventing sexually-transmitted HIV.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 2003, CRS has been one of the largest and most successful partners in PEPFAR. In its extensive experience and in the documented experience of others, only an approach to sexually transmitted HIV prevention that has sufficient funding for a behavior change strategy based on abstinence, partner reduction, and faithfulness education has yielded meaningful advances in stopping the spread of HIV. Educating youth on the risks they may face and providing them with good "life skills" so that  they can make good, sound decisions, actually saves lives. Evidence shows that the HIV and AIDS prevalence rates in at least 7 of the 15 PEPFAR Focus Countries are declining--and in every such case, there is a significant decline in the reported numbers of sexual partners and in the number of unmarried youth aged 15-24 who are sexually active.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no evidence that an increase in the use of condoms alone, without abstinence and behavior change interventions, has reduced the rate of AIDS cases. Our experience leads us to strongly reaffirm the need for designated funding for abstinence-until-marriage, funding that was virtually non-existent before PEPFAR. Without funding for such programs, human lives, particularly in Africa, may be further threatened. A recent Washington Post article presents concrete evidence in this regard, affirming  that in the case of Botswana, "soaring rates of condom use have not brought down high HIV rates. Instead, they rose together, until both were among the highest in Africa" ("Speeding HIV's Deadly Spread," Washington Post, March 2, 2007; p. A1).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has responded to the health needs of the poor around the world with generosity. We ask that you support any effort to restore the PEPFAR-mandated allocation for "abstinence-until-marriage" funding. In addition, we urge you to fully fund this important investment in preventing HIV infections and saving lives, and not let it be side-tracked into diversionary battles. Now is the time for new investment, not re-fighting old battles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With appreciation for your continued support for addressing the critical health needs of the poor around the world, we remain,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely yours,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;center&gt;THOMAS G. WENSKI,&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="GLOBAL HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE">
    <paragraph>I would just like to clarify and ask either the ranking member or the gentleman a question. Number one, I'm puzzled that you don't trust the President of the United States and give him the discretion. We're not changing the law. We're just giving the President the discretion. Now, that's Number one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number two, I believe both gentlemen said that waivers can be issued. Of course waivers can be issued. I believe the gentlemen know that when a waiver is granted the other countries may make up the difference. So, for example, if waivers are granted to 50 percent of the countries, I think of my trip to Arusha, Tanzania. And there was a hut right in the middle of this community, a Masai village, and there were 15 huts around it. And the chief of that village went from hut to hut to hut to hut,  spreading HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I'd be interested to know how this would work if the waivers are granted, and many of the other communities around the world have to make up for that waiver, how would this be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the gentleman, Number three, has also talked about a comprehensive program. Well, we may agree. I believe in abstinence. I think it's great. And if it can be implemented in Africa and Asia and all the other countries that are spreading HIV/AIDS like wildfire, I'm perfectly in support. But we're talking about comprehensive programs, including abstinence. And I'm glad the gentleman agrees that this should be comprehensive programs including abstinence. Would you like to respond?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I will yield to the gentleman first.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="GLOBAL HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE">
    <paragraph>The only thing your amendment would do is remove the A and the B from the ABC model.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="GLOBAL HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE">
    <paragraph>No, excuse me. There's confusion in the amendment. My amendment would give the President the authority, the President of these United States, with Ambassador Dybul, to make these decisions. We're not removing anything.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="GLOBAL HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE">
    <paragraph>And the President could remove the A and the B, and just have the C. And when Ambassador Dybul was asked if any of the countries wanted waivers, they all said no.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="GLOBAL HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE">
    <paragraph>May I inquire of the Chair how much time is remaining?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentlewoman has 30 seconds remaining on her time.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="GLOBAL HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE">
    <paragraph>I move to strike the last word. And I'm pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="LEE" of="">
    <paragraph>Let me thank our chairwoman for yielding and for her leadership, and just say, as one of the authors of the PEPFAR legislation, I actually helped write the majority of this legislation. I can tell you that while I did not agree nor support the 33 percent earmark, I know for a fact that this does not undo that earmark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just tell you a couple of things. You probably have heard, and you know that over the next 10 years, more than 100 million girls in developing countries will be married before their 18th birthday, and often against their will.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As currently written, the bill does not change the underlying abstinence-until-marriage earmark. For me that's unfortunate, but it doesn't change that. And it does not require the President to make any changes to current prevention funds. The current language merely provides the President with the flexibility to plan the most appropriate and sensitive and required program for countries per their request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, the administration has already waived, you're right, application of the abstinence earmark for certain countries receiving assistance under our global AIDS programs. But I want you to remember, ABC does mean abstinence, be faithful, use condoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many of these young girls, abstinence is not an option. And we must provide them with what they need to protect themselves. ABC is ABC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Lowey language provides a very practical, commonsense, 1-year fix, mind you, 1 year. And it gives the President the authority to program global AIDS funding according to local country needs. Ultimately, it will be up to the President to determine whether to exercise this flexibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment, Mr. Pitts, it really does render a death sentence to millions of girls and their children and their babies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I urge my colleagues to vote against restricting the ability of the President to save lives. And that's what this amendment would do. And so I hope that all of the posturing and all of the ideological debate today really comes down to the fact that we believe, all of us believe in ABC: Abstinence, be faithful, use condoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as I said, I helped write this bill. And I was much opposed to this earmark, but, believe me, I know that this does not remove it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I urge my colleagues to oppose the Pitts amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="GLOBAL HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I'm very pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="GLOBAL HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment, and I thank the chairwoman of the Foreign Operations Committee for her leadership in this area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My life has been devoted to public health, to bettering it. And this amendment is bad public policy wherever it will affect lives. It forces, actually, bad public health policy and removes the flexibility to opt for better allocation of public health services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PEPFAR is extremely important to our fight against the transmission of HIV/AIDS and our treatment of the 40 million people living worldwide with this disease. But as the Institutes of Medicine and GAO have both reported, country teams have been greatly limited in their ability to provide effective lifesaving services by the restriction  that has been placed for the past several years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud Chairwoman Lowey for lifting this restriction by allowing PEPFAR funds to be spent where they are actually needed in order to accomplish the program's goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We spent all last week listening to complaints about a lack of responsible spending. Quite frankly, making the amount of funds available for proven effective public health programs dependent upon spending for unproven, ineffective programs is the epitome of irresponsible spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, to support responsibility.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I just want to clarify for my distinguished ranking member and my colleague from Pennsylvania that what this does is give the President of the United States of America the authority, the flexibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe in ABC, abstinence, be faithful, use condoms. But I want to make it very clear to my colleagues, when the administration uses the waiver, then the other countries of the world still have to meet that one-third percent when it comes to prevention, abstinence. All we're saying, again, is abstinence, be faithful, use condoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to prevent unnecessary abortions. We have to save lives. We have to make sure that we do whatever we can to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400169" topic="GLOBAL HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to engage in a colloquy with Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member Wolf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady and Ranking Member Wolf for working with me throughout this process on an important issue that I have worked on for many years and that's Plan Colombia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, Colombia is a critical U.S. ally in the region, and it's in our interest to cultivate this partnership to ensure that Colombia remains strong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I sincerely appreciate the chairwoman's efforts to address my concerns about the overall cuts to the program, particularly given the constraints of the bill. However, I still have concerns about funding levels provided for the Colombian aviation programs, as well as some of the certification requirements contained in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alternative livelihood, which the chairwoman is very interested in, and I am too, and other developmental projects are certainly vital to our overall effort in Colombia, but they can only be successful in areas where the Colombian Government maintains territorial control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That being said, I would like to continue working with the chairwoman and ranking member to address some of these issues as we move forward to conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, once again, I thank you and I look forward to working with you as the process continues.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="GLOBAL HIV/AIDS INITIATIVE">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, to my friend the former Speaker, I want to thank you for the collaborative way you have worked with me and our ranking member, Mr. Wolf. I would like to commend you for your many years of dedicated and unyielding work on Colombia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, as you, have long been deeply concerned about the situation facing us in the war on drugs. We agree that increasing drug interdiction efforts is necessary. We also agree that Colombia is a vital partner and ally of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say again that I fully recognize the strategic importance of Colombia. In no way does this bill reduce our steadfast support to our friends in Colombia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've tried, in this bill, working with my good friend, Mr. Wolf, to strike a more balanced strategy that shifts the aid from the military and strengthens civilian governments, humanitarian assistance and rural development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I continue to believe that we need to attack the underlying and pervasive poverty that is at the root of the problems in Colombia, as well as the region. I've attempted to increase the social component in our assistance to Colombia and begin Colombianization of the the military package and place a greater emphasis on interdiction rather than eradication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also increases funding for judges, prosecutors and rule of law and creates jobs in the legal economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I say to my good friend from Illinois, I greatly appreciate your advice, the give-and-take you have provided as we drafted this bill. I want to assure the gentleman that the committee will continue to pay close attention to his concerns as we work through the next stages of the process.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I want to join my colleagues in continuing to work on the important issue. U.S. assistance to Colombia has been directly responsible for bringing stability to the country. The people of Colombia couldn't travel freely, but now they can. The security is due to Plan Colombia. I appreciate the Speaker's hard work over the years on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Mrs. Lowey, Chairwoman Lowey for really being very open and taking all the time to kind of work this out.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400249" topic="ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairwoman, and I rise for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy with the gentlewoman from New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, Madam Chairman, I would like to thank you for your efforts to increase funding for nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, demining and related programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would have targeted a specific increase for the counterterrorism program within the nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, demining and related programs account. This vital program was only funded at the President's request of $6 million, which is actually a reduction from the $7.4 million in last year's budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the good work done by the chairwoman and by the committee in meeting the President's request. I understand that. But the President has not done a sufficient job in the area of counterterrorism, and there has been actually a reduction in this area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the cochair of the Task Force on Terrorism and Proliferation Financing,  I have joined many of my colleagues, including the Chair, in meetings and hearings facing the challenges that we confront in the United States Government in battling terrorist financing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the attacks on 9/11 Congress and this committee have taken significant steps towards utilizing investigation and data collection regarding terrorist financing as a viable intelligence tool for disrupting the financing of terrorist activities. Nevertheless, terrorists' proven ability to move money through innovative means necessitates continued progress in this critical counterterrorism area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al Qaeda's strength, for example, rests in its ability to continually adapt to U.S. tactics, and thus it requires greater innovation and greater resources in order to develop new strategies to counter those efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In April, I had an opportunity to organize a trip to the Middle East where we met with high-ranking banking officials to discuss the issue of anti-terrorism financing in Jordan, in Afghanistan, in Iraq and in Istanbul, Turkey. I believe that through international financial pressure, we can effect real change in the policies of other countries towards these terrorist groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the parts of the world where financial restrictions would have the greatest impact, unfortunately, U.S. influence is at its lowest. On the other hand, however, I know from our own experience that these countries do want to participate in the global economy. Thus, we have seen that these countries are more likely to adopt transparency in their finance laws for the purpose of gaining legitimacy in the eyes of global investors rather than simply responding to U.S. pressure. By allocating more  resources to induce anti-money-laundering compliance and transparency, we can make significant gains in tracking terrorists and cutting off their funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we made some progress, considerable work remains to be done in regulating, for instance, the hawala system, which is an informal transfer system used extensively in the Middle East, because anytime you have a lack of transparency and a lack of accountability regarding the movement of funds, there is a great likelihood that terrorists and criminals can harness the system for their own gain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By closing off legitimate financial markets for terrorists, we force them to change tactics that are less secure and oftentimes easier to track. A perfect example is the example of December 14 and the arrest of Palestinian Prime Minister Haniyeh at the border crossing into Gaza from Egypt carrying an estimated $30 million in cash in suitcases for the Palestinian Authority and for Hamas. The reason that Hamas has to operate that way is because financial markets were not available to them. Instances  like these highlight the importance and indeed the benefit of focusing on counterterrorism financing efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In essence, I am greatly concerned that the President is not doing enough and that by meeting the President's request, we here are not doing enough to stop the financing of terrorist operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would yield back to the gentlewoman from New York for a response.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the gentleman. I agree that the counterterrorism financing program is a vital tool in assisting foreign countries' efforts to identify, freeze and prevent the use of financial institutions, businesses and charitable organizations as conduits for money to terrorist organizations, including giving countries an investigative ability to follow the money trail and arrest terrorists preemptively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the work of the Department of State, the Department of Justice and the Department of Treasury in assisting countries who are at risk to terrorist financing. However, overall budgetary constraints did not provide sufficient opportunity for us to increase the requested funding level at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I want to assure you, this is a priority of this committee. This is a priority of this Congress. In fact, I have been a member for years of this same task force, the same committee of which you are cochair, I believe, and I look forward to working with you as the bill moves through this Congress to conference to see if we can bolster those funds.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Olver) for the purpose of a colloquy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="INTERNATIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION AND TRAINING">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank first of all Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member Wolf for their good work in bringing this good bill to the floor. But I rise today particularly to commend Chairwoman Lowey, Ranking Member Wolf, and the subcommittee for their efforts to relieve the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. By providing over $200 million for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid to Darfur, this bill will provide desperately needed support for the 2.5 million people  driven from Darfur or displaced within Darfur by the Sudanese's deliberate actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet even as I acknowledge the significant resources that have been included in this bill, I cannot contain my outrage and frustration that the genocide in Darfur continues. Hundreds of villages and small towns have been razed, burned to the ground, and obliterated, the men killed, the women systematically raped, children slaughtered as if they were vermin, survivors fleeing for their lives into the squalor of refugee camps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A common tactic of this horror has been to stuff the villages' water wells with the bodies of the dead so there will be no water for people who try to return to their ancestral homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last week, Sudanese President Omar Bashir agreed, yet again, to the deployment of a joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur. This proposal calls for 20,000 African Union peacekeepers to be led and paid for by the United Nations. President Bashir has apparently offered his unconditional acceptance to the plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But do we have any reason to believe that this latest agreement is anything but one more delaying tactic? After all, President Bashir already agreed to a joint U.N.-A.U. peacekeeping force in November only to renege a couple of months later. Each time the international community moves even timidly towards imposing punitive measures against Sudan, President Bashir briefly acquiesces and then promptly resumes his unconscionable obstruction of peacekeeping efforts. How are  we  to know if this latest concession is any different?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last week, activists representing 36 organizations addressed a letter to the U.N. Security General, Ban Ki-moon, decrying the escalating attacks in Darfur and documenting the flight of aid organizations from the region. The conference on Darfur to occur next week in Paris will provide one more opportunity for the United States, France and other nations to join together in outlining tough consequences for Sudanese failure to accept prompt deployment of the twice-agreed-upon U.N.-A.U. peacekeeping  force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that the Sudanese Government responds to international pressure, but it must be fierce and sustained if it is to finally end the vicious and senseless slaughter of the people of Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to ask simply five questions, Mr. Chairman. How many times in this Congress have we and will we congratulate ourselves for passing virtually unanimously powerless resolutions condemning the Bashir regime's actions in Darfur?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, Will President Bush build on the study provision in the House-passed Armed Services authorization for fiscal year 2008 to develop a robust base in Chad for the deployment of peacekeeping forces and for the delivery of food and services to the millions of refugees?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Or three, Is this administration so committed to other dealings with Sudan that all of President Bush's statements about the genocide in Darfur are just words?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four, Why should America participate in the 2008 Olympic Games in China when China repeatedly obstructs U.N. action on Darfur?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, When will America's 4-year demonstrated impotence be perceived as complicity in the horror of Darfur?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to stop the shilly-shallying, stop the attacks on civilians, and bring peace to Darfur. Today as we again provide funding for humanitarian assistance, let us remember that our lack of more effective action will be judged harshly by future generations who will wonder why we didn't act decisively to stop the genocide in Darfur.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to begin by thanking Chairman Lowey, Mr. Wolf, Mr. Obey, and Mr. Lewis for their great cooperation and working with me to find an acceptable compromise on the important issues in this amendment. I am grateful for their agreement to support the amendment text before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment serves two basic purposes. First, it seeks to restore funding for two initiatives: it restores funding for the U.N. Democracy Fund at the administration's requested $14 million level, which had been zeroed out in the committee report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democracy Fund, an initiative proposed by President Bush in 2004, increases cooperation between democratic countries and supports new and transitional democracies. It has been successful in making grants to programs in more than 100 countries around the world to support civil education, voter registration, access to information, and democratic dialogue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent weeks, I have been working with the chairman of Foreign Affairs, Chairman Lantos, and his staff to ensure that a $14 million authorization for the Democracy Fund stays intact in preconference meetings with the Senate on <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> and <bill type="h" number="982">H.R. 982</bill>, the Advanced Democracy Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am glad that this amendment provides us with another opportunity to continue our bipartisan support for this critical work. The amendment also would restore $6 million out of the $10 million requested by the administration for the U.N. Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This initiative, modeled on the Democracy Fund, is designed as a voluntarily funded, freestanding trust that will make technical assistance grants to promote positive environments for business and innovation around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, in addition to restoring those deleted funds, this amendment will strike $20 million from the proposed U.S. contributions to the U.N. Development Program. The past 6 months have brought a series of very serious revelations and questions about the UNDP activities in North Korea, Mr. Chairman, a rogue regime under sanctions by the U.N. Security Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we appreciate the fact that the program has been terminated in North Korea, there has not been sufficient investigation and cooperation from UNDP in answering questions that bear on the fundamental issues that are of national security interest to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The $20 million cut proposed in my amendment will send a clear signal about our demands and expectations for greater transparency and accountability from the United Nations Development Program while also continuing to make a substantial contribution to UNDP's core programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again I thank my colleagues for their bipartisan support for this important amendment.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>I understand the intent of this amendment, and we have worked to craft an amendment we both can accept.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, I believe that the United Nations Development Program is a key partner in our efforts to address global poverty. Their programs work to spread democracy, to address global HIV/AIDS, to improve the environment, and to respond to natural disasters and crises. All of these programs are critically important and they are working.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of their broad mandate, they often work under very difficult circumstances, and it is their work in North Korea that has led to the recent allegations of inadequate controls on funds to North Korea. These are serious concerns and need to be addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I want to point out to my colleagues that UNDP has reacted swiftly to these concerns by suspending its program and closing the office in North Korea. In addition, UNDP is working with its executive board to put new accountability and transparency measures in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In light of congressional concerns that have been raised on both sides of the aisle, I worked with the gentlelady to negotiate this agreement which reduces UNDP resources in order to provide support to the U.N. Democracy Fund and the U.N. Entrepreneurship Fund. I appreciate the gentlewoman's interest in this issue and accept her amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would repeal a section of U.S. law that requires a report to Congress 15 days before any U.S. assistance can be obligated for Liberia. The obligating agency, whether State or USAID, would be required to submit this paperwork in addition to information they may have already provided in their annual budget documents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I should note that the only other countries that are currently subjected to this requirement are Sudan, Zimbabwe, Serbia, Pakistan and Cambodia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as you and many of my colleagues know, for over 20 years, the people of Liberia have been subjected to the ravages of poverty, conflict, coups, and corruption. As one observer put it, "seldom has a country sunk as far as Liberia did under the leadership of Charles Taylor and his predecessors." I do think I need to recount the number of casualties from wars, including the last civil war which only a few years ago with the assistance of U.S. leadership, which killed a quarter of  a million of the country's 3 million people and displaced most of the rest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, the people of the Republic of Liberia had the opportunity to go to the polls, some lining up for many hours, and open a new chapter in that country's tortuous history. When it was all said and done, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf was elected President, becoming the first female president of any African country. In recognition of this historic election and the tremendous opportunity presented by these elections, last March, the House welcomed President Johnson-Sirleaf on her visit to the U.S.  during which she addressed Congress, the U.N. Security Council, and met with President Bush.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the year and a half since then, President Johnson-Sirleaf has been busy trying to rebuild the nation's education and health system, devastated by years of war, oversee the deactivation and reintegration of the old security forces and ex-combatants, and accommodate the return of thousands who fled the country during the wars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I am offering a very small and simple amendment which I believe would help make a difference in helping President Johnson-Sirleaf succeed in the monumental task--and it is monumental--that lays before her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would repeal a section of U.S. law that requires a report to Congress 15 days before any U.S. assistance can be obligated for Liberia for any purpose. The obligating agency (whether State or USAID) must submit paperwork for all obligated funds in addition to any information they may have already provided to Congress about these projects in the annual budget documents. I should note the only other countries that are currently subjected to this requirement are Sudan, Zimbabwe, Serbia,  Pakistan, and Cambodia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to State Department and USAID officials, such requirements impose reporting, program review, and other requirements that, in some cases, substantially slow the disbursement of reconstruction assistance to Liberia. This requirement was placed on Liberia funds beginning in the early 1990's and were put in place to give Congress the ability to exercise additional oversight when the ruthless and corrupt Charles Taylor and his predecessors ran Liberia and when U.S. assistance was relatively  small. From 1996-2003, U.S. assistance ranged from $3 to $6 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, in light of the recent elections and optimism about the future of Liberia, Congress in the last few years has significantly increased U.S. assistance to Liberia. However, some have expressed concerns, including President Johnson Sirleaf, that the current laws notification requirements are delaying the receipt of these funds for important projects to help rebuild Liberia as it emerges from conflict. According to the State Department, these delays can be as long as 4 to 6 weeks and  dependent on the Appropriations Committee being available to receive them--such as in the middle of the August recess. Given Liberia's 6-month rainy season (May to October) when much work cannot be done on many projects, these delays could push projects on the ground much farther behind schedule in reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would prevent U.S. assistance from Liberia from being subjected to these additional reporting requirements in FY 2008. The State Department supports removing Liberia, noting that it will speed up the obligation of U.S. funds to this important country. The State Department notes, as do I, that these reporting requirements have outlived their usefulness with respect to Liberia. In the past, when we were dealing with the regime of Charles Taylor, they were absolutely useful and necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, as Congress continues to express its support to President Johnson-Sirleaf and the people of Liberia, including $100 million more in aid in the bill before the House, let us support efforts to speed up--and likewise remove obstacles that would hinder--the establishment in Liberia of social and economic conditions that foster reintegration, economic growth, and rebuilding of infrastructure--including access to basic education and health services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In these crucial but surprisingly fast moving first few months of President Sirleaf Johnson's administration, it is critical that we not only support her with words of encouragement, but remove bureaucratic obstacles that help prevent needed aid from being timely delivered to implement reforms and show that a democratically elected government can meet the people's needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Removal of Liberia would not set a new precedent. Over the years. the following countries have been under and then removed from this reporting requirement: Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Colombia, Panama, Peru, Nicaragua, Jordan, and Uganda, just to name a few. It can hardly be argued that Congress exercises less oversight  over assistance to those countries now than it did when they were subject to the obligation reporting requirement.  Additionally, the FY 2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill that was passed by the House removed Liberia from this provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why would we want to delay development assistance such as education funds to a country where more than half of the people today cannot read or write? Where male life expectancy at birth is slightly under 38 years and for females, slightly under 42 years. Infant mortality: 157 infants per 1,000 live births die before there first birthday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I certainly appreciate the need for Congress to retain and exercise oversight over these funds to ensure that they are being properly used, just as we do with the other nations receiving under this bill. Indeed, most of the countries receiving funding in this bill are not subjected to this reporting requirement. Once removed from these requires, the same regular Congressional Notification process would apply to Liberia that applies to all other countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear. Removing this requirement does not mean that Liberia is somehow a perfect country without problems or challenges. In fact, removing this requirement would recognize those challenges and serve to remove one more obstacle to ensure that this country and its new leaders have every opportunity to succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As President Sirleaf-Johnson said in her address before Congress last March: "They (the Liberian people) are counting on me and my administration to create the conditions that will guarantee the realization of their dreams. We must not betray their trust. All the children I meet, when I ask what they want most, say, "I want to learn." "I want to go to school." "I want an education." We must not betray their trust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that the gentlewoman from New York, the chairperson of the subcommittee, Ms. LOWEY has been keenly aware of this issue. I certainly appreciate the efforts made by her, her staff, and Members of the Committee as they put together this very important bill and note the Committee's appropriate role in oversight and ensuring that funds are properly spent.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400326" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Representative Moore's amendment striking the requirement of congressional notification for foreign assistance to Liberia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I joined Ms. Moore on a recent delegation to Liberia under the auspices of the House Democracy Assistance Commission, which has an ongoing partnership with the Liberian Congress. We are working to support the new democratic government in Liberia, under the leadership of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a government that is attempting to lift Liberia from the wreckage of its recent history of civil war and dictatorship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We met with President Sirleaf, and she told us that the window of opportunity for this democratic government to demonstrate progress is brief. Liberia is facing enormous challenges: intractable poverty, an unemployment rate of 85 percent, crumbling infrastructure, and a public health crisis. The Liberian government simply must find a way to deliver significant advances if it is to convince its citizens that democracy is a viable option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our foreign assistance is critical to helping President Sirleaf show rapid progress. It is supporting the development of the economy, the strengthening of the government, the provision of basic services like electricity, and the reintegration of civil war combatants into productive roles in society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the biggest hindrance to our assistance efforts in Liberia is an outdated notification requirement that sets up a series of bureaucratic hurdles, delaying the delivery of our aid, often by several months. With time so critical in accomplishing progress, we cannot afford these delays. I urge my colleagues to support Representative Moore's well-designed and well-considered amendment to eliminate this outdated requirement and to give Liberia the chance it deserves to succeed.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400661" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you so much, sir.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to acknowledge that this administration has done a great deal for Liberia. Certainly Chairwoman Lowey has been exceptional. Liberia is a huge priority for her. I noted that my colleague, Ms. SHEILA JACKSON-LEE, earlier, Mr. Chairman, added money to this bill, and as my colleague, Mr. Price, has said, this will make or break, I think, this administration that we are all so hopeful of the beautiful democracy that is budding in Liberia. This would be a precedent-setting  form of assistance that will cost us no extra money.</paragraph>

As you know, the subcommittee agrees with you that Liberia should be a priority. We support the efforts currently under way by President Johnson Sirleaf to move her country out of poverty. We provided a total of $40 million in the fiscal year 2007 supplemental and in this bill we provide a total of $106.5 million for Liberia.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <chair> The Clerk will designate the amendment.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="DEFINITION OF PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND ACTIVITY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, under current law, the global gag rule, also known as the Mexico City policy, prohibits foreign nongovernmental organizations, NGOs, from receiving any U.S. assistance unless they agree not to use their own funds to perform or refer patients for abortion or to even advocate the legalization of abortion. This policy applies even when abortion is illegal in a country or when NGOs promote the legalization of abortion for cases of rape and incest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us keeps the global gag rule intact with one important exception. It would allow for the provision of contraceptives, not direct funding, the provision of contraceptives to foreign NGOs to help reduce abortion, unintended pregnancy and the spread of HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me repeat that. The intent of the bill is to provide international NGOs U.S.-donated contraceptives, not funds for millions of men and women who desperately need them. The provision provides absolutely no assistance for abortion. It is strictly prohibited in 10 other sections of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I have made clear my intent to allow only for the provision of donated contraceptives, some of my colleagues have brought to my attention concerns that the language as currently written could be interpreted more broadly than intended. Therefore, to make it absolutely clear to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who may have concerns about the language, I am offering this amendment to my own bill to clarify the existing language by narrowing the provision in question by replacing it  with the following language beginning on page 97, line 10 of the bill:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"That, in order to prevent unintended pregnancies, abortions, and the transmission of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, no contract or grant award exclusively for the purpose of providing donated contraceptives in developing countries shall be denied to any nongovernmental organization solely on the basis of the policy contained in the President's March 28, 2001 Memorandum to the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development with respect to providing  contraceptives in developing countries, or any comparable administration policy regarding the provision of contraceptives."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment, which replaces the current provision in the bill with the one I just read, can leave no doubt in any reasonable individual's mind that the provision will provide contraceptives. It will not provide funding to foreign NGOs. In fact, this amendment would advance the Bush administration's stated goal of the Mexico City policy "to make abortion more rare" and protect women and children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Filling the unmet need for contraceptives could prevent 52 million unwanted pregnancies, an estimated 29 million abortions, 142,000 pregnancy-related deaths, and 505,000 children from losing their mothers in just 1 year. These are statistics. How much more evidence do my colleagues need to be convinced that contraception reduces abortion, saves lives? It is simply not enough to say that you support family planning as long as the current restrictions remain in law, denying millions of the poorest  men and women around the world access to contraceptives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my judgment, support for my amendment represents a good-faith effort to find common ground on this issue. I really do hope that we can all agree that voting against family planning and the provision of contraceptives, which my colleague from New Jersey will ask you to do in a later amendment, and against the opportunity to provide more than 200 million men and women in developing countries with access to contraceptives is the most extreme vote any of us can take.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="DEFINITION OF PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND ACTIVITY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the Lowey amendment because it does not address the underlying problem. Whether we support pro-abortion organizations through cash donations or items of cash value, the result is the same. The amendment before us today attempts to undermine the Mexico City policy. The Mexico City policy exists to draw a bright line between U.S. family planning policy and abortion. However, it appears that there are some out there who wish to blur this line. Mr. Chairman,  a blurred line is what leads to coercive abortions and forced sterilizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mexico City policy is critical for several reasons. First, money is fungible. Every U.S. tax dollar or commodity that goes to an abortion provider frees up funds to pay for more abortions and more pro-abortion lobbying. Secondly, our population grantees are seen as representatives of the United States in the countries in which we operate. When organizations prominently associated with United States family planning programs perform and promote abortions, people in these countries logically  associate these activities with the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that this policy does not in any way reduce funds for family planning. As this chart shows, before Smith-Stupak, there are $441 million for international family planning, including contraceptive commodities. After Smith-Stupak, there will still be $441 million for international family planning, including contraceptive commodities. It simply requires that any foreign nongovernmental organizations that receive taxpayer dollars agree not to perform or actively promote abortions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to oppose the Lowey amendment, support the Smith-Stupak amendment to restore the Mexico City policy and to protect the taxpayers' rights to neither directly nor indirectly fund abortion.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="DEFINITION OF PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND ACTIVITY">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to make a comment. The money will not change; there is not going be an increase or a decrease with regard to the amendment. This is about where the money is going to go, and there are 20 countries at least where we are not able to get contraceptives to women and men in these countries who need it. This is not about increase or decrease. This is about getting the money to where it needs to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman before me stated, how can we support coercive abortions. There are many prolife Republicans and prolife Democrats who voted for trade with China, to increase investment in China. We all don't have to rehash what China does with their pro- abortion policy. So the coercive argument needs to at least be consistent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to share with my friends, I am a prolife Democrat, but I believe that this will reduce the number of  abortions around the world. This is the only way to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The example I want to share with my colleagues is Ghana, where abortion is illegal. The oldest and the largest family planning organization in Ghana previously provided a third of the contraceptives in the nation with no abortion services. It has received no U.S. assistance for family planning, which has decreased access to contraceptives by 56 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has led to an increase of almost 500 abortions in Ghana because we were not providing prevention. The abortion debate in the 21st century needs to be about prevention. That is exactly what this bill does, this amendment does, and what Ms. LOWEY is trying to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to share with our colleagues, because we seem to get mixed information, prevention and family planning does reduce the number of abortions. We have many countries where we have implemented this, and it has worked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last two decades, in the last two decades, there have been significant declines in abortion rates in a number of countries like Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Chile, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Romania, Russia and Turkey. In Russia the abortion rate declined by 61 percent between 1988 and 2001 because of an increase of 74 percent of preventive and contraceptive use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know prevention works. If you want to reduce abortion, we need to provide the prevention. Mrs. Lowey just went to great lengths to say we are just shipping the product. This is not money; this is not funds. We are going to ship the product, and then those organizations will be able to take the money they save and buy more contraceptives, not provide abortion, especially in these countries where abortion is already illegal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to support the amendment from the Chair.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank my good friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the Lowey amendment reiterates the unambiguous intention of the underlying language in the bill that Mr. Stupak and I will seek to strike later on, that, if enacted, provides in-kind U.S. taxpayer assistance to pro-abortion organizations around the world. That's what's happening here, nothing more and nothing less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prolife Members, especially some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, know and fully understand that in-kind contributions are of no less value than money. In-kind or cash, it is a distinction without a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The intended recipients of the Lowey amendment are precisely those pro- abortion organizations that have refused to divest themselves of abortion and agree to the Mexico City provisions. The Mexico City policy, separates family planning from abortion. The Mexico City policy helps to ensure that foreign nongovernment organizations that want U.S. grants, be they in the form of cash or in-kind commodities contraceptives, only engage themselves in family planning, as advertised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It stands to reason, if we support pro-abortion organizations, unborn children and their mothers, and the laws that today protect them, will be put into jeopardy; and the violence of abortion will increase and not be diminished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just note that neither the Mexico City policy, nor the amendment that Mr. Stupak and I will offer today, reduces family planning by so much as a penny. It simply strikes the language in the bill that carves out an exception to the Mexico City policy for who? The pro-abortion organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a matter of fact, since the restoration of the Mexico City policy, several countries, including Ethiopia, DR Congo, Nigeria, Uganda, Haiti, Pakistan, have gotten huge increases in contraceptives and family planning assistance. Ethiopia, for example, went from $4.9 million to $19.5 million in 2007 under the Mexico City policy, almost a 300 percent increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congo went from $1 million to $9 million. Pakistan for 1.4 to 16.5. U.S. funding to Nigeria and Uganda doubled while Haiti tripled. USAID has made it clear that it targets what its analysts say is unmet need. Even Ghana has seen its average annual contraception shipment rise, from $1.5 million in calendar years 1998-2001 to $2.3 million for calendar years 2002-2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Mexico City policy, the U.S. has remained the largest donor nation by far to international family planning. We just insist and direct that those funds are used in a way and go to the groups that are about family planning and are not double hatted, trying to enable abortionists and abortion lobbyists overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would point out, as Mrs. Lowey stated earlier when she talked about lobbying, the Mexico City policy, I have a copy for anybody to read, makes it very clear that when it comes to lobbying, we are only talking about lobbying for abortion as a method for birth control. Exempted explicitly, unlike what she said earlier, are rape, incest and life-of-the-mother provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope she will correct the record. It is clearly false.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I do thank my two friends and colleagues for their work on this important issue and for this opportunity to clarify the intent of the provision. I want to be very clear. The intent of this provision is only to allow for the donation of the contraceptives and not to provide funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I disagree with broader interpretations of this language, I wanted to offer an amendment to clarify this provision. My amendment is crystal clear. It would only allow NGOs to receive U.S.-donated contraceptives, not funds, for distribution to millions of men and women across the globe in desperate need of these products.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the question here is who really gets the money. That's the question. I think that it hasn't been addressed adequately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say at the outset, I support, I, Frank Wolf, support family planning, period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A May 22 Washington Post article described a recent crackdown on Chinese families that have violated China's one-child policy. The article stated that Chinese birth control bureaucrats showed up in a half-dozen towns in Guangxi Province carrying sledgehammers and electric cattle prods to destroy the homes and businesses of those who had failed to pay their fines under China's coercive one-child policy. The article described family-planning officials as ransacking businesses owned by parents of  more than one child. Those who protested were bloodied in the struggle, and villages reported people being killed in the violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I heard that on NPR too. It was brutal. So that's really what we are talking about, because the United States-Mexico City policy prevents funding from going to international organizations that promote abortion as a means of family planning, including in China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two prime examples of these organizations are the International Planned Parenthood Federation and Marie Stopes International, both of which are closely tied to the Chinese one-child policy. They are, in essence, the ones that will get this. They never, ever speak out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, China was the second country to become "officially recognized as a qualified member of the International Planned Parenthood Federation." On its Web site, International Planned Parenthood Foundation recently touted, saluted, just said it was a great thing, China's effort to exploit, its exploitation policy, family-planning policy regime worldwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't want to get off too far on this, but this is a country getting aid for these groups that are poisoning your toothpaste, poisoning your pets, and, if you read the article the other day, painting Thomas the Tank Engine trains with lead paint that most people here, their children and grandchildren have. This country is the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We restrict UNFPA funds to China expressly because China is coercive and this is a coercive government. This is a government that single-handedly could be stopping the genocide in Darfur today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Organizations that will receive funds under the new family planning language in this bill will be able to help China continue these unconscionable, and, I would say, immoral activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support family planning, but I can't support, will not support giving family planning taxpayer funds to these kind of organizations that not only never speak out, but actually participate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I just would like to respond quickly, before I recognize Mr. Kirk, to my good friend, Mr. Wolf. As Mr. Wolf knows, no money is going to China. China has no participation in this debate at all. It's very clear. In fact, not only did we not address UNFPA in this bill, we strengthened the prohibition so that not a dime would be spent in China. So I just wanted to clarify that China has nothing to do with this debate on contraceptives.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400222" topic="DEFINITION OF PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND ACTIVITY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to rise and maybe remove some of the partisan tension as a Republican Member in support of this amendment that otherwise, without action, the global gag rule would cut off critical providers of family planning assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this Congress the issue of illegal immigration is at the top of our agenda. And women in developing countries consistently report that they would like to have two to three children rather than five to seven.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As population pressures rise, so does the move to enter the United States, legally or illegally. To reduce the illegal immigration pressure on our borders, we need short-term solutions like border enforcement, and long-term solutions like backing voluntary family planning to help women in developing counties have the smaller family that they want.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The global gag rule has been used to cut off the International Planned Parenthood Federation because it used less than 1 percent of its own privately raised funds for abortion-related services. And when we cut off IPPF, we might have another provider of family planning assistance to the women of Mexico for example, like the UNFPA, but we cut them off too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would argue that the American people would strongly agree with the principle that if Mexican women wanted to have fewer children, then we should help them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Voluntary family planning would boost child survival rates. It would also lower the rate of growth of Mexico's population. A slower rate of growth of Mexico's population would improve the economy of Mexico. It would also reduce the environmental pressure on Mexico's ecosystem. But a slower rate of growth would also reduce the long-term illegal immigration pressure on America's borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should adopt this bipartisan amendment. We should help women in developing countries have the smaller families that they want. We should also adopt policies which reduce the population pressure on our own borders with a policy that supports the rights of women and lowers the pressure on our environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the Chair for offering this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I want to say that I, Doctor, Representative Phil Gingrey as a pro-life OB-GYN, in the interest of full disclosure, I want to say that I'm very supportive of family planning, but not family planning that includes definition of abortion as part of family planning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Lowey amendment, which I'm opposed to, I'm not questioning her integrity or intent in what she says in explanation, but I think it's a very confusing amendment. And when we just heard the two Democratic Members engaging in a colloquy with the chairwoman, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar) and the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), as they said that they were very much in favor of the Mexico City policy and wanted to make sure that no money would be spent,  and I think the chairlady tried to explain that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But then just a second ago, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Jackson), stood up to ask our ranking member if there was anything in the Lowey amendment that spoke to the issue of funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I would say to the gentleman, Mr. Chairman, and my colleagues, funding versus commodity. If you tell me that you're going to give me $75, that's funding, I guess. If you're going to say, no, I'm not going to give you $75, I'm going to give you a tank of gas, it's the same value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I think as the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) was explaining earlier with his poster, that you ultimately take money away from the countries that need it. And we don't want to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you really want to make sure that we don't export abortion to another country, then we're going to have an amendment coming up momentarily, the Stupak-Chris Smith amendment, that strikes the language and restores the Mexico City policy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, I will quote USAID on this, Mr. Ryan.

    <paragraph>It's all about prioritization. I showed you earlier one country after another that has had a doubling and a tripling of their money and commodities and contraceptives since the Mexico City policy was reinstated in 2001. It's all about prioritization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also say, because Ghana was mentioned earlier today, just because Planned Parenthood of Ghana is so obsessed with abortion promotion that it won't sign the policy, other NGOs and other providers have stepped into the breach and provide family planning and abortions to the people of Ghana.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my good friend from New York, Ms. Lowey, the chair of the Subcommittee on the State Foreign Operations Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I think we have to make something really clear, perfectly clear; that in this bill, in this bill there are 10 provisions, 10 provisions that specifically outlaw or prohibit the use of U.S. funds in foreign assistance for abortion or the promotion of abortion. We have it right here on these charts. Ten provisions, in total, that prohibit the spending of any U.S. funds on the promotion of abortion or abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment and this legislation is not about abortion. It is about prevention. And there's an opportunity here for our colleagues to support prevention. Here we have the gentlelady from New York, what she's trying to do is prevent 52 million unplanned pregnancies each year, 29 million abortions each year, 1.4 million infant deaths each year, 142,000 pregnancy-related deaths each year, and over a half a million children from losing their mothers each year. That's what this amendment is about.  That's what the gentlelady is trying to accomplish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other side of the aisle is saying that they're for family planning. Well, here is your opportunity to demonstrate that. Here is your opportunity to show, not only the Congress, but the United States and the world, and especially the developing world, that you are for family planning and helping to extend not only life, but the quality of life in many of these countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we ought to be applauding what the gentlelady from New York is trying to do today, as opposed to trying to derail that. If you are for family planning, here is your opportunity. If you're for prevention of transmittable sexual diseases here is your opportunity to stand up. Stand up for family planning and support the gentlelady from New York in her motion, in her amendment and the underlying bill as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This is not a repeal of the Mexico City policy. Whatever one thinks of it, it is not.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This isn't about abortion, and it really isn't about fungibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Wolf, if you take your position far enough, we should give no military assistance to any country that has a policy on family planning that you don't like because in that sense it is fungible. But that carries it beyond a rule of reason. And what this proposal does is to apply a rule of reason, as has been said, to contraceptives provided in kind to people who need these contraceptives. That is the long and the short of this. And, essentially, you are the ones who are blurring the  issue, not us. And if you take your logic to the extreme, you will tie this appropriation process for numerous countries into knots. This is trying to untie a knot, if you want to put it that way, only in the sense of providing products in kind to people who need them.

  <speaking speaker="412010" topic="DEFINITION OF PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND ACTIVITY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the Lowey amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the Mexico City policy was first promulgated in 1984 and renewed by the current administration in 2001. This policy simply requires that, as a condition for receipt of U.S. family-planning aid, whether commodities or cash, foreign nongovernmental and international organizations certify that they neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning. This is a sound policy, and we should not undermine it in any way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Lowey amendment is an attempt to blur this line by diverting contraceptive commodities from organizations that do not promote or provide abortion to those that do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Abortion is a tragic loss of life not only to the child but to the mother. We know from the affidavits that were produced from the Gonzales v. Carhart case, 180 post-abortive women, what they had to say. Let me give you an example of one:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"How has abortion affected you?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"My life is worthless to me. There is nothing in it. Shame, guilt, and regret is hard to live with. I am 50 years old now."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, what we should be doing here is eliminating the gag rule. But that is not what we are doing. All that this amendment does is to allow family-planning organizations to receive free donations of contraceptives and condoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, instead, the opposition wants to prohibit even this, even though you suggest that you are for family planning. You would never do this to the women of America because they have control over their lives. But the women of the Third World don't have control over their lives, and you know that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is going to happen without access to contraceptives is that 52 million unwanted pregnancies will occur, and there will be almost 30 million abortions as a result. Where is the sense in that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have got to find a way for women to control their lives in the Third World. The fact is a vast majority of women in the Third World don't have any control over when the sex act is performed. That is not their choice. Most of them are married and most of them are in faithful relationships irregardless of their husband's conduct. They are overwhelmed by the number of children they have to provide for. But you want to deny them the ability to control the number of children in their family?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412230" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am listening to this debate today, and it seems to me that the question is not if there is money going to family planning. I understand there is $441 million already allocated, U.S. money, that goes to foreign countries for family planning. But the question is whom is the money going to and do the organizations that receive the money for family planning promote abortion as a method of family planning. And that is what this whole debate is on our side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the way I see it, if we supplement the budgets of other organizations in foreign countries who use abortion as family planning by giving them contraceptives, which we already do, by the way, $441 million worth of family-planning help, then we are supplementing their budgets so that they can have freed-up money to continue down the route of doing abortions for family planning. So it is just kind of logical that that is what we are doing here by changing this policy. And that is why I support  the Smith-Stupak amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the gentlewoman has been kind to say that she wants to work in good faith and find common ground, and she has said it is her goal to get contraceptives to other countries. So if that is our goal and our goal is not to help other countries with abortions for family planning, then let's accept this amendment, the Smith-Stupak amendment, and let's pass it and let's show that the United States will not be in the business of exporting abortions to foreign countries.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as we are debating this, I think that one thing we have to be mindful of is every Member of Congress knows what an in-kind contribution is. And I would just like to say that we know that we have to account for in-kind contributions and we have to consider this in the Lowey amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I oppose this because I really feel that we need to protect the international family planning integrity. We know what the Mexico City policy was put in effect to do. We know that people in this country do not want their taxpayer dollars used to provide for abortion as a means of family planning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another thing that has not been brought into this debate is this amendment really is a poison pill. I think that it undermines the Mexico City  policy, and I think that it could possibly subject this bill to a veto. And I think we need to be very mindful of that as we engage in this debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we need to be mindful that this amendment doesn't increase USAID funding for contraceptives. It simply diverts contraceptive commodities from organizations that do not promote or provide abortions as a method of family planning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I rise in opposition to the Lowey amendment. I understand the intention. But, again, we all know what an in-kind contribution does, and we know what it does to the budgets of those organizations that promote abortion as a method of family planning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Smith-Stupak amendment is the only amendment that removes the poison pill, restores the Mexico City policy, and allows the USAID to continue to direct the U.S. family-planning resources to organizations that are not engaged in pro-abortion activities.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Sires).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Lowey amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would clarify existing language in the Foreign Operations bill that would only, and I repeat, only allow for NGOs to receive U.S.-donated contraceptives. This amendment makes it clear that only contraceptives will be donated and made available to millions of men and women around the world. Not funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By increasing global contraceptive supplies, this will help many women and men overseas plan their families, protect against sexually transmitted diseases, and minimize at-risk pregnancies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, since the administration reinstated this policy in 2001, 20 nations have stopped receiving U.S. shipments of contraceptives. Women and children in these countries often suffer from high maternal and child mortality rates because of a lack of adequate health care and access to family planning. I believe we must give hope to these women and families by providing them with the contraceptives they need to make their own decisions regarding their families. And I also think it is essential  to provide individuals with the tools they need to protect themselves against the spread of HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support, and I urge all the Members to support this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in opposition to the Lowey amendment, although I do want to express my appreciation to Chairman Lowey for preserving, as she indicated, the 15 different restrictions that are in this bill on the use of American taxpayer dollars overseas to directly fund abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I want to say respectfully to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, come on. Legislation that disallows contributions to fund abortions in family-planning organizations around the globe ought to also disallow in-kind contributions to those same organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Money is fungible. We know that. Organizations that receive commodities can take the resources that they would have used to purchase those commodities and use it to promote abortion. We all know. We are adults in this room. We all know that we are seeing here a concerted, sincere, and I would like to say respectfully creative legislative effort to undermine a policy known as the Mexico City policy that I think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know is broadly supported by the American  people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whatever the view is on abortion in this country, the American people don't want to see their taxpayer dollars used to fund abortions at home or abroad. They don't want to see their taxpayer dollars used through the foreign aid program to fund organizations that promote abortion as a means of family planning. And the possibility of making tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of dollars available to organizations that promote abortion around the globe, making it available in the form  of commodities is still making resources available to organizations that promote abortion.</paragraph>
