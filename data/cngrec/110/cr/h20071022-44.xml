    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer words of condolence to the family and friends and colleagues of former Missouri Congressman, Robert A. Young, III.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well-known for his stalwart defense of working men and women, Congressman Young left St. Louis a better place today as a result of his work in this House. Here he founded the Blue Collar Caucus and served on the Public Works Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After serving in the Missouri legislature, he was elected to Congress in 1976 with his Missouri classmates, Ike Skelton and Dick Gephardt. His devotion to public service never wavered, from the time of his early military service in World War II, where he took part in the landing on Utah Beach on D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge, earning the Bronze Star.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob Young inspired generations of St. Louisans to seek out the American Dream, personifying the importance of his family, his union, and his community. Congressman Young will be long remembered for his efforts to turn ideas into reality. He committed himself to making sure our Nation's roadways, railways, and airways were safe for all of us, insisting that our transportation system be state-of-the-art.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like the proud pipefitter he was, everyone privileged enough to know him would agree the work we do here on behalf of our Nation today must be completed, leaving no job left undone. Rightfully we pause to thank him for his service to Missouri, this House and our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Missouri from the Second Congressional District.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, coming from the Second Congressional District, my memory is just long enough to recall some actual personal encounters with Bob Young. Bob was almost a caricature of politics in North County, St. Louis. Bob was a guy who was a pipefitter, he was a war hero, he was in the Third Army under Patton, came back, got into politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He served 20 years in the Missouri legislature, house and senate, and then came down here for about 10 years or so and was very plain spoken. He wasn't noted for sugar-coating things, but he had a wonderful sense of humor, fiercely loyal to labor unions, but reasonably conservative in a lot of other regards, left a family that was involved in politics as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But somebody who had a real cheerful twinkle in his eye, a good sense of humor and somebody I know that the St. Louis area will long remember as a good leader and a good man. So we are sorry for his passing. On the other hand, we are thankful for the richness of his life.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I want to thank the gentleman and would ask the House to pause for a moment of silence.</paragraph>
