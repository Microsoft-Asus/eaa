  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="Introducing S. 2209. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue code of 1986 to provide incentives to improve America's research competitiveness, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2209">S. 2209</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to join with my friend and colleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, to introduce the Research Credit Improvement Act of 2007. We are joined by a bipartisan group of our Finance Committee colleagues: Senators CANTWELL, CRAPO, KERRY, SMITH, LINCOLN, and SNOWE. As its title suggests, the purpose of this legislation is to extend permanently and to improve the research credit, which is set to expire in just a  short time, at the end of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation has benefited greatly in recent years from strong economic growth. I believe it is vital for all Americans to realize that this economic growth did not just happen by accident. Rather, it is based on several factors, and one of the more important of these is innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Innovation certainly does not just happen either. It is the result of several specific ingredients. Chief among those ingredients is the amount of research and development occurring in the economy. Where does R&amp;D come from? It comes from individuals, companies, and governments who are willing to invest time and money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Research and development is very expensive for companies to undertake. By its very nature, research activities seldom result in success immediately. There are many dead ends and much frustration on the way to the discovery of a product that can lead to profits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, many times a firm's efforts to find innovative solutions to life's problems result in good discoveries for mankind, but little or no immediate or even intermediate rewards for the company undertaking the research. For this reason, most economists agree that even private research and development activities can create a common good, and one that should be partially subsidized by the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The original research credit was enacted over 25 years ago to encourage an increase in R&amp;D activity and to help subsidize the common good that often is derived from research and innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as today's economic health is a byproduct of the innovation that came from yesterday's investment in R&amp;D, our future economic health will depend on the amount of innovation we harvest from our investment in research activities today, tomorrow, and into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Years ago, our country had the clear edge on the rest of the industrialized world when it came to having the most nurturing environment to foster research and development. We had more than our share of the scientists, researchers, and other skilled workers to engage in R&amp;D. We had plenty of capital. We had world-class facilities. And we had the biggest market for products right here in the U.S. All the ingredients for innovation were right here, and few other countries could match our research  environment. Thus, there was little thought of going anywhere else to perform research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, this is no longer the case. Many of our trading partners now possess equal, and sometimes, superior environments to promote research to those we have here in the U.S. More importantly, many of these trading partners now offer strong tax and other incentives designed to lure research to those nations and away from our shores.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without a strong and effective research incentive of our own, I fear that the United States is at risk of losing its leadership position in innovation. The consequences of this could be very serious for our future economic growth and job creation, as well as for long-term prosperity and national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, our research credit is set to expire in just a few weeks, at the end of December. Once again, American businesses are finding themselves in the all-too familiar position of wondering if the Congress is going to extend the research credit, and if so, when and for how long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This perennial guessing game that we force our research-intensive firms to play every year or two is getting old. Moreover, it makes the research credit far less effective than it would otherwise be if it were a constant. While it is true that there is some level of confidence among the users of the research credit that this incentive will be extended, everyone knows that the chances of the credit's renewal are not certain, especially in today's volatile legislative climate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, the legislation we are introducing today once again provides for the credit to be made permanent. A permanent credit can help our economy develop the new technologies that will enhance existing capital inputs and make workers more productive. The result will be a stronger economy at home, and a more competitive Nation abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In assessing the health of our economy, we find an important correlation  between economic growth and inflationary pressures. One sure way to have strong economic growth without the pain of inflation is to increase productivity. Most productivity gains are derived from technological advances, which reduce the cost of producing goods and services, and thereby help maintain low consumer prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An additional benefit of productivity growth is a corresponding increase in corporate profits. Such increases lead to higher returns on savings and investment, and higher wages for workers. I believe the greatest benefit of increased R&amp;D is productivity growth, which in turn forms the foundation of higher living standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Productivity growth also largely determines our society's long-term economic welfare. Our ability to deal with budgetary challenges, such as Social Security, Medicare, and other entitlements, depends critically on the future direction of our productivity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home State of Utah is a good example of how important research and innovation is to state economies, and to our future prosperity. Utah is home to various firms that invest a high percentage of their revenue in R&amp;D. There are thousands of employees working in Utah's technology based companies, with thousands more working in other sectors that engage in R&amp;D.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a recent article in one of Utah's major newspapers, the Deseret Morning News, the number of Utah high tech and life sciences companies grew at the astonishing rate of more than 10 percent--from 3,900 to 4,300--over the period of September 2005 to September 2006. These industries in Utah employ more than 62,000 workers, with average pay that is 66 percent higher than the statewide average nonagricultural wage. About 3,000 of these jobs are new ones added in the past year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the kinds of jobs and the kind of job growth that Utah, and all of the United States, needs for this new century. The jobs and companies in the high tech and life sciences sectors in Utah and around America are diverse. But they have several things in common. They are clean, they are high-paying, and they require an educated workforce. The vast majority of these companies export products, helping to offset our trade imbalance. Most importantly, however, is the fact that all of these  jobs depend on innovation as their lifeblood. R&amp;D is in the very DNA of these companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One more thing all these highly desirable high tech jobs have in common is that America is at risk of losing them if we are not careful to maintain an environment that nurtures innovation and the other vital ingredients that gave rise to these jobs in the first place. To my way of thinking, keeping a strong and viable research credit is a key part of this environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1981, when the research credit was first enacted, the Federal Government has joined in partnership with large and small businesses to ensure that research expenditures are made in the United States. This enhances domestic job creation, and helps the United States to internalize more of the economic benefits from the research credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems clear that to continue to grow our economy we must maintain and enhance our position as the world leader in technological advances. The worst thing we could do is to let it slip. Consequently, robust R&amp;D spending should permeate our economy. We simply must continue to invest in research and development, and the Federal Government needs to reaffirm its role as a partner with the private sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the research credit has proven to be a powerful incentive for companies to increase research and development activities, it unfortunately does not work perfectly. There are several reasons for this, but a major one is that the original, or traditional, credit is calculated using a base period from the mid-1980s. This reference period is becoming more distant and thus less relevant to the business operations of more companies each year. For example, many companies have had major changes  in their business models over the past two decades. Yet, the traditional credit still requires a calculation that references revenue from this set of years from two decades ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has been a growing problem for a number of years. To address it, Congress last year included an alternative to the traditional credit that instead of referencing the old base period, is based on the taxpayer's most recent three years of research activity. This credit, known as the simplified alternative credit, has provided a meaningful tax incentive for firms with significant and growing amounts of research expenditures that were not getting much, if any, benefit from the traditional credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Based on many discussions with companies that use the research credit, it appears that the alternative simplified credit is now being used by more companies than is the traditional credit. This is true even though the alternative simplified credit is set at 12 percent, while the traditional credit is set at 20 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, Senator Baucus and I have decided to introduce a change in the research credit that would phase out the traditional credit, even as we increase the benefits of the alternative simplified credit. Specifically, our bill would continue the traditional credit for two more years, and then would eliminate this method of computing the research credit, beginning in 2010. At the same time, however, the bill would increase the alternative simplified credit from the 12 percent current  rate to 16 percent in 2008, 18 percent in 2009, and 20 percent for 2010 and thereafter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe this gradual transformation from the increasingly obsolete traditional credit to a single more relevant and strong alternative simplified credit should create a smooth and generous transition, both for traditional credit companies and for firms that find the new alternative simplified credit to be more beneficial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in this effort. We have had widespread bipartisan support for extending the research credit here in the Senate. In fact, the Senate in 2001 passed a permanent research credit, but its permanence unfortunately was downgraded to another extension in conference with the House bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that if we allow the research credit to expire, we will see the negative effects manifest in lower economic growth, fewer jobs created, fewer innovative products created, and lost opportunities as research activities move to other countries with more attractive incentives. Again, we should never forget that our Nation's future economic health is dependent on the innovations of today and tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States needs to continue to be the world's leader in innovation. We cannot afford to allow other countries to lure away the research that has always been done here. We cannot afford to have the lapses in the research pipeline that would result if we fail to extend this credit before it expires on December 31. We need to make the credit permanent so we can increase the growth rate of our economy. And, we need to improve and simplify the credit so that it is more effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Enacting this legislation would mean more and better jobs for American workers. Innovation and new technology resulting from American research and development will continue to improve the standard of living for every person in the U.S. and around the world.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="Introducing S. 2209. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue code of 1986 to provide incentives to improve America's research competitiveness, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, back in 1962, Marshall McLuhan wrote, "The new electronic interdependence recreates the world in the image of a global village." Certainly, 40 years later, that concept is truer than ever. As we prepare for the future in this global village, we need to affirm America's leadership role in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States accounts for one-third of the world's spending on scientific research and development, ranking first among all countries. While this is impressive, relative to  GDP, though, America falls to sixth place. And the trends show that maintaining American leadership in the future depends on increased commitment to research and science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Asia has recognized this. Asia is plowing more funding into science and education. China, in particular, understands that technological advancement means security, independence, and economic growth. Spending on research and development has increased by 140 percent in China, Korea, and Taiwan. In America, it has increased by only 34 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Asia's commitment is already paying off. More than a hundred Fortune 500 companies have opened research centers in India and China. I have visited some of them. I was impressed with the level of skill of the workers whom I met there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China's commitment to research, at $60 billion in expenditures, is dramatic by any measure. Over the last few years, China has doubled the share of its economy that it invests in research. China intends to double the amount committed to basic research in the next decade. Currently, only America beats out China in numbers of researchers in the workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I am pleased to join with my colleague on the Finance Committee, Senator Hatch, to introduce the Research Competitiveness Act of 2007. This bill would improve our research competitiveness in four major areas. All four address incentives in our tax code. Government also supports research through Federal spending. But I am not addressing those areas today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, our bill improves and simplifies the credit for applied research in section 41 of the tax code. This credit has grown to be overly complex, both for taxpayers and the IRS. Beginning in 2008, our bill would create a simpler credit for qualifying research expenses that exceed 50 percent of the average expenses for the prior 3 years. This simplified credit would phase in over 3 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as important, the bill makes the credit permanent. Because the credit has been temporary, it has simply not been as effective as it could be. Since its creation in 1981, it has been extended 11 times. Congress even allowed it to lapse during one period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The credit last expired in December of 2005. After much consternation and delay, Congress passed a 2-year extension just last month, extending the credit for 2006 and 2007. These temporary extensions have taken their toll on taxpayers. In 2005, the experts at the Joint Committee on Taxation wrote: "Perhaps the greatest criticism of the R&amp;E credit among taxpayers regards its temporary nature." Joint Tax went on to say, "A credit of longer duration may more successfully induce additional research  than would a temporary credit, even if the temporary credit is periodically renewed."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, there are three different ways to claim a tax credit for qualifying research expenses. First, the "traditional" credit relies on incremental increases in expenses compared to a mid-1980s base period. Second, the "alternative incremental" credit measures the increase in research over the average of the prior 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both of these credits have base periods involving gross receipts. Under the new tax bill enacted last month, a third formula was created, which does not rely on gross receipts and is available only for 2007. Our bill simplifies these credits and will move all taxpayers to the "Alternative Simplified Credit," which is based on research spending without reference to gross receipts. The current formulas hurt companies that have fluctuating sales. It hurts companies that take on a new line of business  not dependent on research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new simpler formula in our bill would not start until 2008. That start date would give companies plenty of time to adjust their accounting. The current formula would be available to companies for 2 years, and then it would phase out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The main complaint about the existing credits is that they are very complex, particularly the reference to the 20-year-old base period. This base period creates problems for the taxpayer in trying to calculate the credit. It creates problems for the IRS in trying to administer and audit those claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new credit focuses only on expenses, not gross receipts. It is still an incremental credit, so that companies must continue to increase research spending over time. Further, this bill adds a mandate for a Treasury study to look at substantiation issues and ensure that current recordkeeping requirements assist the IRS without unduly burdening the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A tax credit is a cost-effective way to promote R&amp;E. A report by the Congressional Research Service finds that without government support, investment in R&amp;E would fall short of the socially optimal amount. Thus CRS endorses Government policies to boost private sector R&amp;E.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, American workers who are engaged in R&amp;E activities benefit from some of the most intellectually stimulating, high-paying, high-skilled jobs in the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My own State of Montana has excellent examples of this economic activity. During the 1990s, about 400 establishments in Montana provided high-technology services, at an average wage of about $35,000 per year. These jobs paid nearly 80 percent more than the average private sector wage, which was less than $20,000 a year during the same period. Many of these jobs would never have been created without the assistance of the R&amp;E credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our research bill would also establish a uniform reimbursement rate for all contract and consortia R&amp;E. It would provide that 80 percent of expenses for research performed for the taxpayer by other parties count as qualifying research expenses under the regular credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, when a taxpayer pays someone else to perform research for the taxpayer, the taxpayer can claim one of three rates in order to determine how much the taxpayer can include for the research credit. The lower amount is meant to assure overhead expenses that normally do not qualify for the R&amp;E credit are not counted. Different rates, however, create unnecessary complexity. Therefore, our bill creates a uniform rate of 80 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second major research area that this bill addresses is the need to enhance and simplify the credit for basic research. This credit benefits universities and other entities committed to basic research. It benefits the companies or individuals who donate to them. Our bill provides that payments under the university basic research credit would count as contractor expenses at the rate of 100 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current formula for calculating the university basic research credit--defined as research "for the advancement of science with no specific commercial objective"--is even more complex that the regular traditional R&amp;E credit. Because of this complexity, this credit costs less than  1/2  of 1 percent of the cost of the regular R&amp;E credit. It is completely under-utilized. It needs to be simplified to encourage businesses to give more for basic research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American universities have been powerful engines of scientific discovery. To maintain our premier global position in basic research, America relies on sustained high levels of basic research funding and the ability to recruit the most talented students in the world. The gestation of scientific discovery is long. At least at first, we cannot know the commercial applications of a discovery. But America leads the world in biotechnology today because of support for basic research in chemistry and  physics in the 1960s. Maintaining a commitment to scientific inquiry, therefore, must be part of our vision for sustained competitiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Translating university discoveries into commercial products also takes innovation, capital, and risk. The Center for Strategic and International Studies asked what kind of government intervention can maintain technological leadership. One source of technological innovation that provides America with comparative advantage is the combination of university research programs, entrepreneurs, and risk capital from venture capitalists, corporations, or governments. Research clusters around Silicon Valley  and North Carolina's Research Triangle exemplify this sort of combination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Academies reached a similar conclusion in a 2002 review of the National Nanotechnology Initiatives. In a report, they wrote: "To enhance the transition from basic to applied research, the committee recommends that industrial partnerships  be stimulated and nurtured to help accelerate the commercialization of national nanotechnology developments."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In sum, our bill would boost both applied and basic research. It would boost research by businesses big and small. And it would foster research by for-profit and nonprofits alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>McLuhan's quote about the global village was taken by many at the time as a wake-up call to a changing world. Since then, many more leaders in this village have emerged. Let us work to see that the next big technological advance is discovered here in America. Only through continued commitment to research can we ensure that it is.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300067" topic="Introducing S. 2212. A biff to support the establishment and operations of Teachers Professional Development Institutes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2212">S. 2212</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, along with my colleague from Connecticut, Mr. DODD, that will strengthen the content and pedagogy knowledge of our present K-12 teacher workforce and thus ultimately raise student achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our proposal would establish eight new Teacher Professional Development Institutes throughout the Nation each year over the next five years based on the model which has been operating at Yale University for over 25 years. Every Teacher Institute would consist of a partnership between an institution of higher education and the local public school system in which a significant proportion of the students come from low-income households. These Institutes will strengthen the present teacher workforce  by giving each participant an opportunity to gain more sophisticated content knowledge and a chance to develop curriculum units with other colleagues that can be directly applied in their classrooms. We know that teachers gain confidence and enthusiasm when they have a deeper understanding of the subject matter that they teach and this translates into higher expectations for their students and an increase in student achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Teacher Professional Development Institutes are based on the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute model that has been in existence since 1978. For over 25 years, the Institute has offered, six or seven 13-session seminars each year, led by Yale faculty, on topics that teachers have selected to enhance their mastery of the specific subject area that they teach. The subject selection process begins with representatives from the Institutes soliciting ideas from teachers throughout the school district  for topics on which teachers feel they need to have additional preparation, topics that will assist them in preparing materials they need for their students, or topics that will assist them in addressing the standards that the school district requires. As a consensus emerges about desired seminar subjects, the Institute director identifies university faculty members with the appropriate expertise, interest and desire to lead the seminar. University</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cooperative nature of the Institute seminar planning process ensures its success: Institutes offer seminars and relevant materials on topics teachers have identified and feel are needed for their own preparation as well as what they know will motivate and engage their students. Teachers enthusiastically take part in rigorous seminars they have requested, and as part of the program, practice using the materials they have obtained and developed. This helps ensure that the experience not only  increases their preparation in the subjects they are assigned to teach, but also their participation in an Institute seminar gives them immediate hands-on active learning materials that can be used in the classroom. In short, by allowing teachers to determine the seminar subjects and providing them the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1999-2002, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute promoted a National Demonstration Project to create comparable Institutes at four diverse sites with large concentrations of disadvantaged students. These demonstration projects are located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Houston, Texas, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Santa Ana, CA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Follow-up evaluations have earned very positive results from the teacher participants in the Yale-New Haven Institute, as well as the four demonstration sites. The data strongly support the conclusion that virtually all teachers felt substantially strengthened in their mastery of content knowledge and they also developed increased expectations for what their students could achieve. In addition, because of their involvement in the course selection and curriculum development process, teacher participants  have found these seminars to be especially relevant and useful in their classroom practices. Mr. President, 95 percent of all participating teachers reported that the seminars were useful. These Institutes have also served to foster teacher leadership, to develop supportive teacher networks, to heighten university faculty commitments to improving K-12 public education, and to foster more positive partnerships between school districts and institutions of higher education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many agree that teacher quality is the single most important school-related factor in determining student achievement. Effective teacher professional development programs that focus on subject and pedagogy knowledge are a proven method for enhancing the success of a teacher in the classroom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though a K-12 teacher shortage is forecast in the near-term and many new teachers will be entering our schools, those teachers who are presently on the job will do the majority of teaching in the classrooms in the very near future. For this reason, it is imperative to invest in methods to strengthen our present teaching workforce. Like many professions, the quality of our teachers could diminish if their professional development is neglected. Positive educational achievements occur when coursework  in a teacher's specific content area is combined with pedagogy techniques. This is what the Teacher Professional Development Institutes Act strives to accomplish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute has already proven to be a successful model for teacher professional development as demonstrated by the high caliber curriculum unit plans that teacher participants have developed and placed on the web, and by the evaluations that support the conclusion that virtually all the teacher participants felt substantially strengthened in their mastery of content knowledge and their teaching skills. Our proposal would open this opportunity to many more urban teachers  throughout the nation.</paragraph>
