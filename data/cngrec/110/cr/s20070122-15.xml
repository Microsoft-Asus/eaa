    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want for a moment this afternoon to talk about another issue that is of great importance to me and I think to a number of our colleagues here in the Senate as well. I am going to chair the Indian Affairs Committee in this session of Congress. I will be working with my colleague Senator Craig Thomas from the State of Wyoming. I am pleased to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to mention that this week my colleagues here in the Senate are likely to see members of Indian tribes who are coming to town from all over the country. They will likely see them here  on Capitol Hill, perhaps in the halls of the Senate and the House. They are here to attend the "State of Indian Nations" address by the President of the National Congress of American Indians. They will come from across the country to hear this "State of the Indian  Nations" address and they will probably also drop in some offices and meet with some Senators and Congressmen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me talk about one of the things I am sure they will talk about in virtually every office, and that is the issue of Indian health care. I have seen hearings where, talking about Indian health care, very powerful tribal leaders have been brought to tears when they talk about family members who have taken their own lives because of depression or drug abuse, or family members who needed medical attention desperately and did not get it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me talk a minute about the first Americans, those who were here first. American Indians and Alaska Natives die at a higher rate than other Americans from tuberculosis. There is a 600-percent higher incidence of tuberculosis than the American population as a whole; alcoholism, 510 percent higher than the population at a whole; diabetes, 189 percent higher than the American population as a whole. Let me say, in many areas it is quadruple, 8 times or 10 times higher than the population as a  whole, in terms of the incidence of diabetes. Indian youth and teenage suicide on reservations in the northern Great Plains is 10 times higher than the national average. There are fewer than 90 doctors for every 100,000 Indians compared to 230 doctors for every 100,000 people nationwide. It is almost unbelievable to see what the Indian community faces with respect to the health care issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Indian Health Service expenditure for each American Indian in 2005 was $2,130, compared to $3,900 that we spend for health care for Federal prisoners. We have a responsibility for the health care of Federal prisoners because we incarcerate them. If they get sick, it is our responsibility to provide for their health care. We have a trust responsibility for American Indians, and if they get sick--or in order to keep them well--it is our responsibility. Yet we spend almost twice as much money  for health care for Federal prisoners as we do to meet our trust responsibility for American Indians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues will have a chance to talk to some of the Indian leaders who come to the Capitol this particular week and visit about these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to show a picture of Ardel Hale Baker, to talk a little about what some people face. It is easy to talk about the statistics. Let me talk about the humanity of this issue. This is Ardel Hale Baker. She is a member of the Three Affiliated Tribes in my State. Ms. Baker had sudden and severe chest pains. Her blood pressure was off the charts and she felt she was having a heart attack. So she went to the Indian Health Service clinic of the Three Affiliated Tribes in New Town, ND, and she was  diagnosed as having a heart attack. At the insistence of the Indian Health Service staff on that reservation, she was sent by ambulance to the nearest hospital, 80 miles away in Minot, ND. When she got to the hospital, Ardel was being lifted off of a gurney from the ambulance to be taken into the hospital, and the nurse noticed a piece of paper taped to her leg. Curious about this woman, with chest pains, likely having a heart attack--curious</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me recreate that again. This is a Native American, living on a reservation. She was having severe chest pains, clearly a heart attack, put in an ambulance and driven 80 miles, and when they pulled her out of the gurney to run her in to the hospital, they noticed a letter taped to her leg in which the Indian Health Service says: "Understand, we don't have the money. Both Ms. Baker and the hospital should understand they may have to assume the cost because we don't have the money to pay for  this. It is not life or limb." So this woman gets a bill for $10,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her life was saved, but it was saved notwithstanding a letter taped to her leg saying: "Admit this woman at your own cost."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is called rationing. It is called health care rationing. If health care rationing existed in this country, there would be an outrage, and it does exist and nobody says much. There is a quiet yawn; somewhere between daydreaming and thumbsucking. People sit around and hardly even think of the fact that when they are sick, it is OK because they can get health care. But when this woman is sick, she might get a letter taped to her leg saying: "Yes, she is having a heart attack, but understand  if you admit her, it is at your own expense."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An Indian tribal chief told us once that on his reservation everyone understood the admonition: "Don't get sick after June." Do not get sick after June, because June is the time of the fiscal year when they run out of money for contract health care  on the reservations. The Indian Health Service runs out of money after June. If you get sick after June, I am sorry, they might tape a letter to your leg. It is "life or limb." If your illness is not threatening your life or your limb, you are out of luck. That is rationing. That is health care rationing, and it is an outrage in this country. It is happening in a quiet way, inflicting misery all across this country on the first Americans, those who expect we would meet our trust responsibility  to provide health care for Native Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to try very hard to see if we can rectify that. I understand the Indian Health Service is staffed with some committed and wonderful doctors, nurses, and administrators. They are understaffed in a dramatic way, underfunded and understaffed. They tell us their budget allows them to treat about 60 percent of the health care needs of the Indian community. That means 40 percent is not dealt with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things I would have us consider is a new model for delivery of health care, particularly on Indian reservations, that tracks what is happening in some other parts of the country where there are the kinds of low-cost, walk-in clinics open at all hours, where you can get the routine health care, routine diagnosis. I hope the Indian Health Service could do that at no charge. But what is happening now is not working at all. Often health care is not available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On one reservation of which I am aware, the clinic there is open 5 days a week. After 4:30 or 5 o'clock on Friday: So long, tough luck. You are 80 miles from the nearest major city hospital, and if you get sick, that is where you are going to have to look for some health care. We need to do better than that. I hope we can succeed in talking to the Indian Health Service about a new model, a new approach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is only one issue of many. We have a full-scale crisis, I believe, in Indian health care, Indian education, and Indian housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have spoken previously about a woman who died lying in bed in her house, who froze to death in this country. A woman named Swift Hawk froze to death when she lay down and went to bed, living in a climate with 35 degrees below zero weather with, instead of windows in their dwelling, plain plastic sheeting. This grandmother went to bed and didn't wake up because she froze to death. If you saw that in the paper, you would think it was a Third World country, but no, it is not. It is this country  and it relates to a health care crisis we need to address. It is not about statistics. It is about the humanity of understanding what is happening and a responsibility to do something about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleague on the Indian Affairs Committee, Republicans and Democrats, who I think are of a like mind, that we have a responsibility here and we need to meet it, and we will.</paragraph>
