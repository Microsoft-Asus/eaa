    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, some years ago the story was told about the mean-spirited old Grinch who tried to steal the joy of Christmas. Well, it is not Christmas, but you might as well almost think it was a Christmas present when you take a look at the American economy that has been strengthened by the tax cuts of a number of years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This boom that the Republicans set in place has added 46 months of straight growth in job creation. The unemployment rate is at a very low 4.5 percent. The Dow has just made all kinds of records at crossing the 14,000 mark, and the deficit has been cut in half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the face of this good news, the Democrats have passed a $392 billion tax increase, the biggest tax increase in the history of our country. And just like the Grinch, the Democrats seem to be wanting to steal our economic joy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must not allow the Democrats to steal the joy of the American families.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
