  <narrative>HONORING JEFFREY LANE MILLER -- (Senate - February 28, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1382">S1382</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300035" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great pride that I recognize Jeffrey Lane Miller of Hendersonville, NC. Mr. Miller is the founder of HonorAir, an all-volunteer community group, which was organized to honor local World War II veterans by providing them with the opportunity to visit their National World War II Memorial in Washington, DC, at no expense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National World War II Memorial, dedicated in 2004, honors the 16 million men and women who served in the Armed Forces of the United States, the more than 400,000 who died, and all who supported the war effort from home. Thousands of WWII veterans pass away every year without having a chance or ability to visit the monument recognizing their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jeff's passion and commitment to America's "greatest generation" has galvanized the Henderson County community. Mr. Miller accomplished what was believed to be the impossible. He organized and obtained funding for chartering commercial aircraft to fly veterans from North Carolina to Washington, DC. His unwavering dedication, with the help of many in the community, has resulted in more than 630 World War II veterans participating in the Hendersonville HonorAir trips. Most of these heroes otherwise  would not have been able to visit their monument due to physical or financial limitations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In partnership with veterans advocates, Jeff created the Honor Flight Network. This network is in the process of honoring the service of World War II veterans from across the United States. As the result of Jeff's inspiration, leadership, and tireless efforts, Honor Flight has been established throughout communities in more than 25 States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I ask that the Senate join with me in recognizing the remarkable public service of Jeff Miller. Jeff has worked so hard to make his dream, of recognizing World War II veterans, into reality. His selfless service has not only had a tremendous impact in his community but throughout our great Nation.</paragraph>
