  <speaking speaker="412227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the President's proposed budget is another step down the long road of fiscal irresponsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this administration's budget claims to reach balance in 2012, in reality, it actually will remain in the red all along those years. After all, over the last 6 years, the Bush administration's fiscal policies have posted the highest deficits in our Nation's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration has squandered the budget surplus it inherited, transforming $5.6 trillion projected surplus into a $2.8 trillion deficit over the same period, completely losing focus of what we need to do in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even with this continued deficit, the budget still hurts American families. It proposes substantial cuts to Medicare and Medicaid both. What does this out-of-whack budget really fund? The President's tax cuts for the wealthy, of course.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the President has put forth another budget that raises our national debt while cutting vital programs to Americans. His priorities haven't changed. Fortunately, the leadership in this Congress has changed.</paragraph>
