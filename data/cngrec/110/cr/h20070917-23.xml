  <narrative>The text of the resolution is as follows</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="583">H. Res. 583</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas during the Holocaust, in which some 6,000,000 Jews were brutally put to death by the Government of Nazi Germany, a small number of individuals risked their lives and spent fortunes to save the lives of others because they were decent and courageous men and women of principle;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, in October 1938, the Nazi Government occupied the Sudetenland area of Czechoslovakia, which resulted in tens of thousands of Jewish refugees fleeing the occupied areas and seeking safety in the areas of as-yet unoccupied Czechoslovakia;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, in late 1938, a 29-year-old British businessman, Nicholas Winton, was encouraged by a friend at the British Embassy in Prague to forgo a ski vacation in the Alps to visit Prague and see first-hand the freezing refugee camps filled with Jewish families who had fled the Sudetenland;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, in the face of this enormous suffering, Winton, moved by feelings of deep compassion, undertook a massive effort to help the children of many of these Jewish families escape these horrible circumstances, though at that time neither he nor they knew the full extent of the horrors that awaited them;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Winton sought to find friendly governments which would grant asylum to these Jewish refugee children, and his efforts were rebuffed by the countries whose help he requested, until the Governments of Sweden and the United Kingdom agreed to accept children from the Czechoslovakian refugee camps;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Winton and other volunteers gathered names and other information on children whose parents recognized the importance of getting their children beyond the reach of the Nazi Government, and Winton was able to use this information to identify foster homes for these refugee children;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Winton took the lead in raising funds to pay for the transportation of the children from Prague to Britain and Sweden and to pay an enormous government-imposed fee to cover the costs of future repatriation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on March 14, 1939, the first 20 children left Prague under Winton's auspices, and the very next day the Nazi army overran the remainder of un-occupied Czechoslovakia;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the heroic effort of Winton and other volunteers to assist these young children flee occupied Czechoslovakia continued for over six months until the outbreak of World War II on September 1, 1939, during which time 669 children were able to leave in a total of eight separate groups;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the ninth group of some 250 children was scheduled to leave Prague on September 3, 1939, but was halted following the outbreak of hostilities, and none of these 250 children lived to see the end of World War II six years later; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas this group of 669 children, saved through the efforts of Winton and his collaborators, includes doctors, nurses, teachers, musicians, artists, writers, pilots, ministers, scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, and a Member of the British Parliament, and today they and their children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren number over 5,000 individuals, and these individuals live in the United States, Canada, Australia, the Czech Republic, Britain, Germany, and other countries;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Winton's achievement went unrecognized and unacknowledged for more than half a century until his wife, who knew nothing of this life-saving work, came across an old leather briefcase in an attic in which she found lists of the children, letters from their parents and other materials documenting his efforts;</narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas, of the 15,000 Czechoslovakian Jewish children who fled to refugee camps or who were forced into concentration camps during the Nazi occupation, only a handful survived World War II, and Vera Gissing, one of the children saved by Winton and the author of the script for the film "Nicholas Winton--the Power of Good", which won the Emmy Award in 2002, said that Winton "rescued the greater part of the Jewish children of my generation in Czechoslovakia. Very few of us met our parents again:  they perished in concentration camps. Had we not been spirited away, we would have been murdered alongside them."; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Winton has been honored with the title of Member of the British Empire (MBE), was awarded the Freedom of the City of Prague, received the Czech Order of T. G. Masaryk, and was given a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II for services to humanity: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) commends Sir Nicholas Winton and those British and Czechoslovakian citizens who worked with him, for their remarkable persistence and selfless courage in saving the lives of 669 Czechoslovakian Jewish children in the months before the outbreak of World War II; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (2) urges men and women everywhere to recognize in Winton's remarkable humanitarian effort the difference that one devoted principled individual can make in changing and improving the lives of others.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I thank the leadership of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Chairman Lantos and our senior ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for their support on this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also especially congratulate the chief sponsor and author of this important resolution, my good friend and member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman Klein, as well as the lead Republican cosponsor, Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, for recognizing the unsung hero of World War II, Sir Nicholas Winton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, whenever humanity is enshrouded in the darkness of atrocity and violence, there are a few scattered lights of moral decency and personal courage that give hope to all mankind that darkness will not prevail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Arguably, Mr. Speaker, there has not been a more terrible period of darkness than that of World War II when Nazi Germany systematically murdered more than 6 million Jewish people. Even during that terrible period there were lights in the moral darkness and who kept alive the values of decency, compassion and courage. One such person was a 29-year-old British businessman, Mr. Nicholas Winton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his frequent business trips to Germany, Mr. Winton observed firsthand the virulent anti-Semitism that prevailed in that country and manifested itself in arrests, harassment, and physical attacks on Jewish people. In 1935, Germany codified anti-Semitism by enacting the Nuremberg Race Laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, after the Munich Agreement of 1938 and the subsequent annexation of Germany of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, Mr. Winton became concerned that Nazi Germany could not be appeased. Indeed, on November 9 of that year, 1938, anti-Semitic violence exploded across Germany and Austria. Because of the broken glass in the streets, that date is remembered as Kristallnacht.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Soon afterwards, Mr. Winton was encouraged even by a friend at the British Embassy in Prague to forgo a ski vacation in the Alps and instead to visit what was left of Czechoslovakia in order to see the refugee camps filled with freezing Jewish families who had fled the Sudetenland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, he was deeply moved by the suffering he saw and was convinced immediate action had to be taken. Mr. Winton conceived of an idea. Upon his return to Great Britain, he organized volunteers to collect names of children whose parents were desperate to get them beyond the reach of the Nazi Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Winton then identified foster homes for those refugee children in Britain and in Sweden. He raised money to fund their transportation and to pay fees imposed by the government to cover the costs of future repatriation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on March 14, 1939, the first 20 children of this venture left Prague. The very next day the Nazi Army overran the remainder of unoccupied Czechoslovakia. Mr. Winton and his volunteers continued their dangerous work for another 6 months, until the full outbreak of World War II on September 1st.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this time, Mr. Winton and his volunteers saved 669 children. These were children who escaped the Holocaust and who later had their own lives and families, thanks to the efforts of this one man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tragically, a final group of 250 children scheduled to leave on September 3 was prevented from doing so. None of them lived to see the end of World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is by coincidence that we even learned about the heroic efforts of now 97-year-old Mr. Nicholas Winton, who never sought any recognition for his actions. Even his wife was unaware of what he had done until she found an old leather briefcase in an attic that contained documents pertaining to the rescue operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the world has now begun to pay tribute to the brave acts of this modest hero, a true man, in my opinion. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and made a member of the British Empire. He received the honor of the Freedom of the City of Prague and was made a member of the order named for the father of Czechoslovakia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is appropriate, Mr. Speaker, for this House to recognize the courageous efforts of this one man, Sir Nicholas Winton, during one of history's darkest moments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400380" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased, Mr. Speaker, to take this opportunity to rise in support of House Resolution 583 recognizing the remarkable example of Sir Nicholas Winton, who organized the rescue of 669 Jewish Czechoslovakian children from Nazi death camps prior to the outbreak of World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sir Nicholas Winton, like many of life's heroes, sought no publicity for his efforts, which ultimately saved those young lives. In fact, for more than 50 years Winton's heroism went unrecognized until his wife, Greta, stumbled across a leather briefcase in their attic in which she found documentation of the children smuggled out of Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia and letters written by their parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though less well known, Sir Nicholas' story has much in common with Oskar Schindler's, which has been celebrated in both print and film.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1938, Nicholas, a British subject, traveled to Prague, where he was haunted by the impression of refugee camps which were newly constructed there. This experience motivated him to tirelessly lobby the British Government in attempts to secure visas for Czechoslovakian Jewish refugee children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Winton's efforts enabled the safe escape to Britain of almost 700 kids who surely would have perished without his intervention. Sir Nicholas' mission was  even more challenging, as it required that he first find a foster family to accept each child before they would be accepted into the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is staggering to consider today that there are over 5,000 descendants of "Winton children" around the world, including the UK, Canada, Czech Republic and the United States, lives that would have perished without Sir Nicholas' selfless dedication to a remarkable humanitarian mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 100 years old today, Sir Nicholas Winton has been honored with the title Member of the British Empire and with knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support this and I thank Mr. Klein for his authorship of this legislation</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of our time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I yield all the time that he needs to the author of this important resolution, my good friend and also a senior member of our committee, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Klein).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412198" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlemen for the presentation and the support of the resolution, House Resolution 583. I would also like to thank Chairman Lantos, who has a deep and abiding understanding of the circumstances leading up to and what occurred during the Holocaust, and of course Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and my cosponsor, Congressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart from Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true hero, Mr. Nicholas Winton, who saved more than 600 children from their death during the Holocaust. Nine months before the outbreak of World War II, Nicholas Winton, then only 29 years old, a young man, used his business and personal connections, urgently working from the dining room of a hotel room, and found safety for these hundreds of children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nicholas Winton took the lead in raising the necessary funds to assure transportation for these children. As was said already, he found foster homes and arranged for the necessary permits and documents. But let's understand this is not just an administrative function that we would think of today to place children. This was under threat of death of himself, his family and anybody who assisted. He saved these children's lives, since most of their families and contemporaries remained in Czechoslovakia,  and they soon perished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These children grew up to be doctors, nurses, teachers, musicians, artists, writers, pilots, ministers, scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, and even a member of the British Parliament. Today they and their children and grandchildren and great grandchildren number over 5,000 human beings, living in the United States, Canada, Australia, the Czech Republic, Britain, Germany and elsewhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nicholas Winton, as was already indicated, was given a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II for his services to humanity. Sir Nicholas never sought credit for saving the lives of these children. In fact, his achievement went unrecognized for more than half a century, and until 1988 his family never knew about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 50 years they were called "Winton's children," as the survivors called themselves, and did not know who to even thank or to whom they owed their lives. The story only emerged when his wife came across a satchel in the attic and found lists of children and letters from their parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1939, as he scrambled to save hundreds of lives, Nicholas Winton wrote in a letter: "There is a difference between passive goodness and active goodness, which is, in my opinion, the giving of one's time and energy in the alleviation of pain and suffering. It entails going out, finding and helping those in suffering and danger and not merely in leading an exemplary life in a purely passive way of doing no wrong."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The life of Sir Nicholas is certainly an example of active goodness. Just as we will never forget the horrors and deaths of the Holocaust, we must also never forget the examples of bravery and heroism that still serve as our role models today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal note, as with many people in this country, much of my grandparents' family was killed in the Holocaust. I think many of us in this country understand and recognize the importance of a man who stood up as bravely as he did, and there were many others who did the same and risked their lives in doing this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the members of Congress today. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to honor the life and accomplishments of Sir Nicholas Winton, a hero to many and a model for all.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for his most eloquent statement. Maybe some day these 5,000 children of Mr. Winton might have a reunion somewhere in the United States to express a real sense of appreciation to this gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recall, Mr. Speaker, the statement by the late Martin Luther King, Jr., who said that in the end we will not remember the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends. Here is one gentleman that was not silent about human rights and what he did for some 669 children whose descendants now enjoy the benefits of what he did some 60 years ago.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="583">H. Res. 583</bill>, recognizing the remarkable example of Sir Nicholas Winton, who organized the rescue of 669 Jewish Czechoslovakian children from Nazi death camps prior to the outbreak of World War II. I would like to thank my colleague, Congressman RON KLEIN, for introducing this important legislation, as well as the lead Republican cosponsor, Congressman LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we recognize one of the great unsung heroes of World War II; a man who stood up against extraordinary evil to defend innocent children. Sir Nicholas Winton is an individual of profound moral decency and personal courage, who, in the midst of the immense darkness of World War II, offered hope that the perpetrators of horrendous atrocities would not prevail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1938, Nicholas Winton, a 29-year-old clerk at the London Stock Exchange, visited Prague and was immediately concerned by the refugee situation. His frequent business trips to Germany had given him first-hand knowledge of the virulent anti-Semitism codified by the 1935 Nuremberg Race laws, manifesting itself in ever-increasing attacks, harassment, and arrest of Jewish people in Germany. The 1938 Munich Agreement, which gave Hitler control over the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia and was  hailed by British Prime Minister as a "peace for our time," did not ease Winton's fears, and he came to recognize that Germany could not be appeased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Winton visited Prague, he found refugee camps, full of freezing Jewish families who had fled the Sudetenland. In particular, he was alarmed that nothing was being done to help the many innocent children, trapped in the gathering storm of war. Before returning to London, he set up a system of Kindertransport, where the names of children where collected and paired with foster homes in Britain and Sweden. When families could not pay to transport their children beyond the reaches of the Nazis,  Winton raised money to fund transportation and other fees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 14, 1939, only a day before the Nazi army occupied all of Czechoslovakia, the first 20 children left Prague. Over the next six months, a total of 669 children were sent via 8 trains to London, where families waited to shelter them. These children were spared the horror of the concentration camps by the courageous efforts of one man. Vera Gissing, one of the many children who, thanks to Winton's work, survived the war, later  wrote, "He rescued the greater part of the Jewish children of my generation in Czechoslovakia. Very few of us met our parents again: they perished in concentration camps. Had we not been spirited away, we would have been murdered alongside them."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A 9th train was scheduled to leave on September 3, 1939, with 250 children onboard. Tragically, Great Britain entered the war that very day, and the train was prevented from leaving Prague, and it later disappeared. None of the children on board was ever heard from again, and none survived the war. In all, 15,000 Czech children were killed in the Holocaust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nicholas Winton is a reluctant hero, who never bragged about his courageous work. He never sought recognition for his actions, and we only learned about his efforts by coincidence. His good deeds did not end with the war's conclusion, and he was awarded a Member of the Order of the British Empire title in 1983 for his charitable work with the elderly. He was further recognized by the City of Prague and the nation of Czechoslovakia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sir Nicholas Winton epitomizes the greatness of the human spirit. He stood against the forces of darkness and helped the powerless during one of history's blackest hours, and then never sought recognition for his extraordinary accomplishments. Six hundred and  sixty-nine children were saved from suffering the horrific fate that befell so many of their friends and family members due to his daring, creativity, and compassion. I am grateful for the opportunity  to pay tribute to this extraordinary man, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
