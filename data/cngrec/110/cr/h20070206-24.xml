  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Dr. Darrell Johnson, the superintendent of Greenwood School District 50 for South Carolina, was quoted saying: "I pledge to do the best I can and work together as a team."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to honor Dr. Johnson during February's Black History Month as a very notable and distinguished African American who has heavily impacted the Third Congressional District of South Carolina. Dr. Johnson's extensive background and his many leadership positions as a teacher, coach and administrator has laid the groundwork for him being named to the position of district superintendent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1991, Dr. Johnson worked for Rock Hill School District Three, beginning as assistant principal at the Rock Hill High School. After serving as assistant principal and principal for Sunset Park Elementary School, he moved to the district office in 1998 as director of student services. In 2001, he was named assistant superintendent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His dedication to making a difference in education propelled him to earn his superintendent position, and rightfully so. I congratulate Darrell Johnson for being able to excel in this capacity where he may apply his natural ability to lead those who are most important to our future, our students.</paragraph>
