    <paragraph>Mr. President, when Lady Bird Johnson passed away on the afternoon of July 11, 2007, the United States mourned the loss of a dignified and compassionate First Lady. Even though she is gone, she has left us with the legacy of her beautification of America. Through her diligent efforts, Mrs. Johnson was not only an advocate for the natural beauty of America but also of the beauty and strength of its people. Sharon and I extend our deepest sympathy to her daughters Lynda and Luci,  their families, her friends, and all of those whose lives have been touched by her life's work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As President Lyndon B. Johnson entered the White House in one of our Nation's most harrowing moments, Mrs. Johnson stood by her husband with poise and courage that helped comfort a wounded nation. Her service to our country would go even further as she became a leading voice for preserving and defending America's natural resources. Here in the Nation's Capital, people can't help but be reminded of Mrs. Johnson's vigorous work to adorn Washington, DC, with flowers, giving us an aesthetic that  all Americans could take pride in and enjoy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have always shared Mrs. Johnson's deeply held love for the beauty of the United States, from the mountains of West Virginia to the plains of Texas. It was because of her commitment to the environment and the splendor of our country that the Beautification Act of 1965 was passed. She strove to line our highways with wildflowers and still found time to enjoy walking through the national parks that she fought to protect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to her work with the environment, I truly admire her efforts to address poverty in the United States. Under President Johnson, the VISTA program was enacted, sending out volunteers to improve the conditions of impoverished communities. I can proudly say that as a VISTA volunteer in Emmons, WV, I saw firsthand the immense benefits of this program for participants and for the communities they serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will never forget her devotion to her husband, her family, and her country. I will never forget her passion fighting for civil rights and against poverty. Nor will I ever forget her determination to leave a beautiful America for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lady Bird Johnson, again, held my sincerest respect and appreciation. To her family and the people of Texas, I offer my deepest sympathies. Mrs. Johnson was a valuable public servant, an inspiration and a friend. More than anything else, she was an irreplaceable First Lady.</paragraph>
