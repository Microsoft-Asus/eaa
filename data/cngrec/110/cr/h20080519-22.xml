  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Soboba Band of Luise&#xF1;o Indians Settlement Act".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) The Soboba Band of Luise&#xF1;o Indians is a federally recognized Indian tribe whose Reservation of approximately 6,000 acres, extending east and north from the banks of the San Jacinto River in Riverside County, California, was created by an Executive Order dated June 19, 1883, and enlarged and modified by subsequent Executive Orders, purchases, and an Act of Congress.</narrative>
  <narrative> (2) The Tribe's water rights have not been quantified, and the Tribe has asserted claims for interferences with the water resources of its Reservation, which the Tribe maintains have rendered much of the Tribe's Reservation useless for habitation, livestock, or Agriculture. On April 20, 2000, the Tribe filed a lawsuit against The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California for interference with the Tribe's water resources and damages to its Reservation allegedly caused by Metropolitan's  construction and operation of the San Jacinto Tunnel, which is part of the Colorado River Aqueduct. The lawsuit, styled Soboba Band of Luise&#xF1;o Indians v. Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, No. 00-04208 GAF (MANx), is pending in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) The Tribe also has made claims against Eastern Municipal Water District and Lake Hemet Municipal Water District, located adjacent to the Reservation, seeking to secure its water rights and damages arising from alleged past interference with the Tribe's water resources.</narrative>
  <narrative> (4) After negotiations, which included participation by representatives of the Tribe, the United States on behalf of the Tribe, The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, Eastern Municipal Water District, and Lake Hemet Municipal Water District, a Settlement Agreement has been developed to determine the Tribe's water rights, resolve all of its claims for interference with the water resources of, and damages to, its Reservation, provide for the construction of water projects to facilitate  the exercise of the Tribe's rights, and resolve the lawsuit referenced in paragraph (2) of this section.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) The Settlement Agreement provides that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) Eastern Municipal Water District and Lake Hemet Municipal Water District acknowledge and assure the Tribe's prior and paramount right, superior to all others, to pump 9,000 acre-feet of water annually from the San Jacinto River basin in accordance with the limitations and other conditions set forth in the Settlement Agreement;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) Eastern Municipal Water District and The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California will contract to supply water to Eastern Municipal Water District and Eastern Municipal Water District will use this water to recharge water supplies into the basin; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) the three water districts will make substantial additional contributions to the settlement, including the conveyance of certain replacement lands and economic development funds to the Tribe, to carry out the Settlement Agreement's provisions.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) to approve, ratify, and confirm the Settlement Agreement entered into by the Tribe and non-Indians entities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) to achieve a fair, equitable, and final settlement of all claims of the Soboba Band of Luise&#xF1;o Indians, its members, and the United States on behalf of the Tribe and its members, to the water of the San Jacinto River basin;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) to authorize and direct the Secretary of the Interior to execute and perform all obligations of the Secretary under the Settlement Agreement; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) to authorize the actions and appropriations necessary to meet obligations of the United States under the Settlement Agreement and this Act. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Bono Mack), the author of this important bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mrs." name="MACK, BONO" of="">
    <paragraph>I thank my dear colleague in the neighboring district from California for yielding me time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="4841">H.R. 4841</bill>, the Soboba Band of Luiseno Indians Settlement Act. This legislation is the product of decades of litigation and negotiations relating to the water rights of the Soboba Tribe. The courts ruled on the legitimacy of their rights and were able to determine that serious damages were suffered by the Tribe from the diversion of their water resources. In the years following that decision, the Tribe, local water districts, cities and other stakeholders spent  years at the table working out a solution that was in the best interests of the entire region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bobby Salgado, the Chairman of the Tribe, tells the story well of how his tribal members saw their lives changed when their water resources drastically decreased. Chairman Salgado testified to the House Natural Resources Committee about how he and others would take gym class first thing in the morning during school just so that they could take showers that day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of the partners to this agreement recognize Southern California's water needs are serious and are best addressed through approaches that are mindful of supply needs and new water use practices. This legislation embodies the linchpin for a comprehensive basin-wide water management plan in the Jacinto River Valley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would like to thank Chairman Rahall, Ranking Member Young, Chairwoman Napolitano and Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers, along with their staffs, for helping quickly bring this legislation to the floor. I would like to also thank Chris Foster from my staff for his hard work on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan legislation, <bill type="h" number="4841">H.R. 4841</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is one of countless examples of Indian sovereignty that has in fact been put below the sovereignty of any other landowner, the sovereignty of any other city, municipality or county.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important bill, but I think in passage today and tomorrow it is very clear that it marks a trend back toward recognizing that Native American tribes have had things taken from them in the past, had to go to court, in Federal Court win, and then find that they have to continue year after year in order to get these rights. Had this been a normal county or private landowner, I strongly suspect this would have been restored years earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I commend the gentlewoman, my colleague in an adjacent district, for bringing this important legislation, ending once and for all an injustice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">

    <paragraph>I wish at this time to thank my colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa), who has managed these bills on the floor with me today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
