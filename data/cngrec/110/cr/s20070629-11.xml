    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to address a few things this morning, some in retrospect of what has been for all of us a pretty emotional couple of weeks of debate, and also looking forward to what is going to occur when we return after the July 4 work period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first thing I would like to point out is my admiration for our majority leader for how he handled the situation on the immigration bill. I think it was an extraordinarily difficult situation for our majority leader to have been in, and he did a great job with a very difficult assignment. I think we should back up and remember the bill that was put before us had not gone through debate. It was put together in a bipartisan way but removed from the committee process. In other words, people from  both sides of the aisle, including some pretty strong members of the leadership on both sides of the aisle, got together and put together this extraordinarily complex bill, which the President himself wanted to see passed, and then it fell to our majority leader to attempt to get the provisions of the bill through the Senate. So we</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would just like to express my admiration and support for the majority leader for the way he handled himself during this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also with respect to the immigration bill, I think there has been a lot of rhetoric that has flown back and forth over the last 24 hours or so about motivations of individuals and what caused people to vote one way or the other. I think some of this is unfortunate. I think some of the people who have made some of the more extreme comments are going to be looking back at them 4 or 5 years from now and perhaps be a little bit embarrassed. This was an enormously complex piece of legislation. There  were parts of the legislation which were very good, and hopefully we can find a way to bring them into law at another time. But there were parts in that legislation which needed to be fixed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, personally, as the Presiding Officer knows, attempted to get an amendment through the Senate that, in my view, would have brought fairness to the issue of legalization and practicality--fairness in the sense that the proposed bill was going to legalize every individual, virtually, who had come to the United States in violation of American laws by the end of last year--and I felt strongly for a good bit of time that those who came during a period of lax immigration laws and who were able to  put roots down into the community should be provided a path toward citizenship. I made this case during the campaign last year, and by saying that last year, I was viewed to be sort of on the forward edge of where this debate was going to go. But this bill, by reaching out and including virtually everyone who had been here by the end of last year, inflamed the passions of a lot of people in this country who otherwise would support fair immigration reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, the amendment I offered also proposed to eliminate what is called the touchback provision, which would have eliminated--for those people who had been here for 4 years and had put down roots--the necessity for them to go back to their home country in order to apply for a green card.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that approach was fair. I regret that the amendment didn't pass. At the same time, I and a number of other people found it impossible for us to vote for the bill as it was coming up with the provision that was so much broader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line on immigration now is there are laws on the books. We have seen a lot of talk over the past day or so that immigration reform is dead. These comprehensive immigration reform packages have a way of falling under their own weight because the issue itself is so complex. What we should be doing now, in the next year and a half or so, given that there is an election, is to do everything we can to enforce the laws that are on the books. One idea I like is the $4.4 billion recommendation  that was put into title I of this immigration bill that just failed that would go toward border security, and employer certification could well be added to any appropriations bill, where the measure would be relevant and could help existing law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So for those who are attempting to say that all immigration reform has now skidded to a halt because a flawed bill was not passed by this body, I say let's enforce the existing laws. There are a lot of laws on the books. One of the greatest problems we have had is particularly in the area of workers being hired by employers on a large scale who know they are here without papers. In those sorts of areas, there are laws on the books we need to enforce.</paragraph>
