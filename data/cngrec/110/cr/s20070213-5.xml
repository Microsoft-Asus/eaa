    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will be in morning business until 12:30, at which time we will recess for our conference work. All time during this period is equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of the Committee on Appropriations will be speaking this morning with respect to the continuing funding resolution. It is my understanding that the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, Senator Byrd, will be here to speak shortly. The Senate will be in recess from 12:30 to 2:15 today, and when we reconvene at 2:15, we have 15 minutes remaining for debate prior to the 2:30 cloture vote on the continuing funding resolution, <bill type="hj" number="20">H.J. Res. 20</bill>. As a reminder, Senators have until  12 noon to file second-degree amendments to the resolution.</paragraph>
