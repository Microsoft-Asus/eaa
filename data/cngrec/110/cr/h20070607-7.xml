  <speaking speaker="400356" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our country is facing a severe shortage of registered nurses. The situation is well-documented. The Journal of the American Medical Association has stated that, without changes, the United States will have a shortage of more than 400,000 nurses by the year 2020. To date, there has been limited government action to address this very national need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Effective health care delivery relies on an adequate supply of well-educated health care professionals, so this week I introduced <bill type="h" number="2572">H.R. 2572</bill>, the Nurse Loan Forgiveness Act of 2007, to expand the supply and to help provide for the education of registered nurses, because nurses play a principal role in the health care delivery system in various settings, in hospitals, in home health agencies, in long-term care facilities, managed care centers and community health clinics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Nurse Loan Forgiveness Act would forgive up to $17,000 in Federal loans over a 5-year period for people who have worked in a hospital at least 1 year. If they continue to work, they would be able to, over time, have that entire amount forgiven.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hope that the Congress has the ability to take action on this critical issue, and I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this very important legislation.</paragraph>
