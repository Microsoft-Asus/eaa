    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on January 29, 2007, I was returning from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland and, therefore, missed three recorded votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I take my voting responsibility very seriously and would like the Congressional Record to reflect that, had I been present, I would have voted "yea" on recorded vote number 58, "yea" on recorded vote 59 and "yea" on recorded vote 60.</paragraph>
