    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I'm delighted to rise today to salute "Homes for Hometown Heroes."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us, my colleagues and myself, Members from as far away as California and Arizona, had the privilege of being in Houston, Texas, last evening at the Hyatt Regency to celebrate a very unique and special program where our hometown heroes, injured soldiers, were able to receive their own home by the largess and generosity of many heroes in our community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it's a moving experience to see our soldiers coming in injured but yet strong and resilient. What a privilege to be able to present to them a key to their own home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with this caucus, the Democratic Caucus, the Republican Conference, and all of our Members to spread this message across America. One has said that all of what they've done, they deserve to be respected and responded to, a home for the injured soldiers, brain damaged, those who cannot walk in wheelchairs, to simply say "thank you." I look forward to announcing a posttraumatic stress disorder center in my own 18th Congressional District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last evening reinforced the fact that nothing is too great for those who have put their lives on the front line. I look forward to celebrating the hometown heroes.</paragraph>
