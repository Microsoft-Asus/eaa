    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="3446">H.R. 3446</bill>, which names a postal facility in Marshall, Michigan, after Michael W. Schragg.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3446">H.R. 3446</bill>, which was introduced by Representative Timothy Walberg on August 3, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on October 23, 2007, by voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire Michigan congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Michael W. Schragg served as postmaster of Marshall, Michigan, for 23 years. In June 1970 he began as a substitute clerk carrier, and in May 1979 he became the postmaster of Marshall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During Marshall's 1987 annual historic home tour, Mr. Schragg began displaying a number of old postal artifacts throughout the post office. Due to the many artifacts displayed, tourists thought the post office was a museum rather than an official working post office. He decided to develop an extensive collection of postal antiques in the basement of the post office and in an annex building. Currently, he is known for his noteworthy accomplishment in the creation of the Marshall Postal Museum.  Everyone in Marshall knows Mr. Mike Schragg as the man who knows everyone's zip code by heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Timothy Walberg, for introducing this legislation and urge the swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400116" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Michael Schragg grew up on his family's farm in Ceresco, Michigan. In 1967, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served in Germany for 3 years. After this period, he returned to Michigan and began his career in the postal service in 1970. Within 5 years he was promoted to postmaster for the Olivet office, and in 1979 became the postmaster for Marshall, Michigan. During his tenure, the Marshall office was named the All-American Post Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond the postal service, Mr. Schragg has always been active in his community. He is a past president of the Marshall Rotary Club and continues to serve on the Marshall Historical Society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, his most noteworthy accomplishment is the creation of the Marshall Postal Museum. The Marshall Postal Museum is the second largest in the U.S., behind the Smithsonian Postal Museum here in Washington, D.C. The museum is now one of the cornerstones of the immensely popular Marshall historical home tour. In fact, in 2003, the New York Times called the postal museum the town's piece de resistance. The article went on to say, "If you think you have no interest in postal history, a tour  conducted by the ebullient Mr. Schragg will change your mind."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond the New York Times, Mr. Schragg and his museum have also been featured in Michigan magazine. Mr. Schragg even drove a vintage 1931 Model A mail delivery truck in the 2001 inauguration parade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Considering his devotion to preserving the past and his work to develop the future of the Postal Service, it is fitting that we name the building where he toiled for so long in his honor. This is especially true since the Marshall Postal Museum is housed in  the basement of the same Marshall Post Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412213" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support of naming the Marshall, Michigan Post Office, a prominent post office in my district, the Seventh District of Michigan, the Michael W. Schragg Post Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael's life story has been recounted to some degree by my colleagues thus far, but he is one that is beloved in his community, family, and the American postal service. Michael served as Marshall's postmaster for 23 years and was the force behind the creation of the Marshall Postal Museum, the second largest postal museum in the United States, behind only the Smithsonian, as has been represented thus far.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael was born in Calhoun County and raised on the family farm in Ceresco, Michigan. He attended a one-room country school, the Francisco School in Ceresco, through the seventh grade, and he then went on to graduate from Marshall High School. Michael met his wife, Loretta, while working at the Robinson's department store as he attended Kellogg Community College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael enlisted in the U.S. Army Post Office in June 1967 and served in Germany for 3 years. Michael and Loretta went on to have three children, two of whom embarked on postal careers of their own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael started his postal career in Marshall, Michigan, as a substitute clerk carrier and quickly earned a promotion to supervisor. The following year he became the postmaster for Olivet, Michigan, only to return to Marshall, serving as the town's postmaster for 23 years. During his tenure in Marshall, the U.S. Postal Service named the Marshall Post Office an All-American Post Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael Schragg has been active in the Marshall community throughout his lifetime. He is a past president of the Marshall Rotary Club and continues to serve on the Marshall Historical Society. Michael's most noteworthy accomplishment is the creation of the Marshall Postal Museum. It is second only to the Smithsonian Postal Museum in size and is housed in the basement of the historic Marshall Post Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Marshall Post Office building, a Greek revival architectural style with copper roof, was constructed in 1932 out of Marshall sandstone. The idea for the downstairs museum occurred during Marshall's 1987 Historic Home Tour. At that time Postmaster Schragg displayed a number of old postal artifacts throughout the building, which was on the historic tour that year. Many people thought the entire post office was a museum rather than an official working U.S. Post Office. After the tour Michael  began organizing the collection of postal antiques in seven rooms in the basement and in an annex building behind the post office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Marshall Postal Museum has since become one of the cornerstones of the annual Marshall Historic Home Tour. It was part of a New York Times article about places in America worth visiting, and Michael and the museum have also been featured in Michigan Magazine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael has taken some of the museum's displays on the road and, as has been mentioned, toured numerous States. Michael drove a vintage 1931 Model A mail delivery truck in President George W. Bush's first inaugural parade in Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of Michael's countless hours of work on the Marshall Postal Museum, his years of service to the United States Postal Service in Michigan, and his dedication to the Marshall community, naming the Marshall Post Office in his honor is a fitting tribute, and I urge the House to join me in support of <bill type="h" number="3446">H.R. 3446</bill>.</paragraph>
