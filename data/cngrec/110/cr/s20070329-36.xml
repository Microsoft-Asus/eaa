    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the passing of William O. "Doc" Farber of Vermillion, SD. Doc Farber passed away this week at the age of 96. He was a selfless educator who dedicated his time and energy to encouraging those around him to strive for success. He will be dearly missed by family, friends, and students, but his legacy will live on for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>William O. Farber was born in 1910 in Geneseo, IL, and graduated from Geneseo Public High School as valedictorian in 1928. He went on to receive his B.A. and M.A. from Northwestern University in Chicago, where he graduated with honors, was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and was a Harris Scholar. After earning his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin, Farber came to the University of South Dakota, USD, as an assistant professor in 1935. He left USD for a department  chairmanship  at North Dakota State in 1937, but returned a year later to serve as chair of the Department of Government, a position he held for 38 years. Along with teaching, Farber was heavily involved in state government and national service. He helped create USD's Government Research Bureau, served as the first director of the South Dakota Legislative Research Council, and was a member of South Dakota's Constitutional Revision and Local Government Study Commissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his 70 years at the University of South Dakota, Farber influenced numerous well-known graduates, including many state and national leaders. Six of his former students were Rhodes Scholars and two of his students, Larry Pressler and Tim Johnson, became U.S. Senators. NBC anchor Tom Brokaw, USA Today founder Al Neuharth, and media personality Pat O'Brien also took classes from the famed professor. Farber was not just an educator, but served as a friend and mentor to many of  his students. According to Brokaw, the advice he received from Farber while in college helped him turn his life around. Always looking out for his students, Doc even drove Brokaw to a job interview in Omaha because the future newsman's car had broken down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Doc Farber was an amazing teacher, a committed public servant, and an all-around remarkable person. South Dakota has lost a truly outstanding man who inspired countless students to broaden their horizons and to make a difference in the world. While Doc Farber will be greatly missed by all who knew him, he will forever be remembered for the life he led.</paragraph>
