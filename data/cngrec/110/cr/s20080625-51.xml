  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are going to come in tomorrow and see what we can get accomplished. I believe we can get a few things done. I have already outlined what we need to do before we leave. With some cooperation we can get that done. If not--as I said here about a half hour ago, 45 minutes ago--if people want to play out this clock, people will have to be here Friday and Saturday. I hope that would be it, but we will have to wait and see. In that the Fourth of July doesn't occur until a  week after we leave here anyway, people should keep in mind that there may be a need for us to work the next few days. I hope that is not necessary. We will have to see what happens. It is a shame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know we talked about the fact that we need to complete the housing bill, but we will complete that the first week we get back. By then Senators DODD and SHELBY maybe will have more things worked out with the House.</paragraph>
