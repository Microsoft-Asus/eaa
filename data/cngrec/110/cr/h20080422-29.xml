    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very pleased to be here today to speak in support of <bill type="hr" number="1112">H. Res. 1112</bill>, a resolution I have introduced with my friend from Illinois, MARK KIRK. The resolution expresses the support of the House of Representatives for the International Coral Reef Initiative designation of the year 2008 as the International Year of the Reef, and for strong environmental and marine research efforts that will allow us to better understand the threats facing the planet's coral reef systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the Great Barrier Reef that spans over 1,600 miles just off Australia's northeast coast, to the coral reefs found within the Red Sea, to the coral reef system that began forming off the Florida coast nearly 7,000 years ago, coral reefs are among the most vibrant and diverse ecosystems on the planet. Known as the Rain Forest of the Sea, these important treasures are not only the source of food and shelter to millions of sea creatures, they also provide environmental, cultural, and economic  value for people around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, coral reefs across the planet are in peril and face an uncertain future. Global estimates suggest that 10 percent of the earth's coral reefs have already been seriously degraded, and an even greater share of reefs face serious decline. Rising sea temperatures, damage by divers and marine vessels, pollution, and other manmade threats have raised the specter that over the next century, a vast number of the world's coral reef systems will cease to exist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most troubling threats facing coral reefs is ocean acidification, a phenomenon that occurs when the ocean becomes so acidic that corals and other shell-making organisms are unable to produce the calcium carbonate or to use the calcium carbonate that they need to form their shells. Another disturbing trend is the onset of coral bleaching, which results from rising sea temperatures causing corals to expel the algae that live within their tissues and provide the corals' different colors.  Once the algae has been expelled, corals lose their color and, lacking the nourishment provided by photosynthesis that algae provides, the coral dies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1994, recognizing the increasing degradation of the world reefs, the U.S. partnered with other countries to establish the International Coral Reef Initiative. Through its efforts, the International Coral Reef Initiative has mobilized regional and national governments to pursue science-based management of coral reef systems, spurred the establishment of coordinated coral reef protection efforts, and assembled organizations and stakeholders throughout the world to address pollution and other  manmade threats that imperil the coral reefs of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The International Coral Reef Initiative has declared 2008 the International Year of the Reef. The Initiative is leading an international effort to continue to bring the preservation of coral reefs into the global spotlight so that we can do what needs to be done to protect these vital national resources for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to commend the International Coral Reef Initiative for its efforts and express my enthusiasm for the level of interest, participation, and action that has been generated as a result of its work. I would also like to thank Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall, as well as their staff, for bringing this resolution to the floor. I look forward to working with them further to ensure that the world's coral reefs are protected and preserved, and I urge passage of the  resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1112, recognizing 2008 as the International Year of the Reef. For almost 15 years, the United States has been an active participant  in the protection of coral reefs around the world. In 1994, the U.S. was one of the founding governments of the International Coral Reef Initiative, ICRI. ICRI is a partnership among governments, international organizations, and nongovernmental organizations that strive  to preserve coral reefs and related ecosystems. This year, the U.S. and Mexico share responsibilities for the joint secretariat of the ICRI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first International Year of the Reef was designated by ICRI in 1997, and this campaign proved to be very successful. Over 225 organizations in more than 50 countries participated and helped raise awareness of the importance of coral reef conservation and catalyzed international conversations and national level policy initiatives. This was certainly true in the U.S.A. when in 1998 an executive order established the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force that led to coordination and the strengthening of  U.S. Government actions to preserve and protect coral reef ecosystems. In 2000, this task force developed the National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs, a comprehensive strategy to conserve those coral reefs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An example of the commitment of the U.S. Government to such coral reef conservation efforts included the establishment in 2006 of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument. President Bush set aside almost 140,000 square miles to receive the most extensive maritime environmental protection permitted under U.S. law. This national monument, which is, by the way, the largest in the U.S., includes a substantial number of coral reefs and related ecosystems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The goals of the 2008 International Year of the Reef campaign include strengthening awareness about the ecology, economic and cultural value of coral reefs; improving understanding of critical threat to reefs and generating both innovative and practical solutions to reduce such threats; and action to develop and implement effective management strategies for conservation and sustainable use of coral reefs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These worthwhile objectives will ensure the continued awareness of the American people in the environments that are not only beautiful, but provide substantial economic benefits. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will lead the U.S. effort on this campaign, and I applaud NOAA's hard work in preserving coral reefs for the enjoyment of future generations. Their dedication does not go unnoticed in this Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 1112.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with that, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma. He and I have had the privilege firsthand of visiting some of the endangered reefs and hearing from some of the world's leading experts, and his eloquent comments about the leadership of our Nation in this regard are well put.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have no speakers at this time, and would reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400247" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Washington, it has indeed been a pleasure to work with, and we have accomplished many things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I would like to yield such time as he might consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kirk).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400222" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague from Oklahoma, and appreciate the leadership, and especially my friend from Washington for bringing forward this legislation. It is a strong resolution that follows up on a congressional recognition of 2008 as the International Year of the Reef in support of research and development to preserve coral reefs around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that coral reef systems are vital to the ecology of our planet. They provide food and jobs and recreation to millions of people around the world. Most importantly, they provide key environmental benefits, including resistance to climate change and protection of shorelines from harmful erosion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coral reefs and their surrounding ecosystems are now under siege. They face damage from marine vessels, destructive fishing methods, development, and especially increased ocean pollution. Climate change has contributed to increasing sea temperatures, which also threaten these critical habitats. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 60 percent of the world's coral reefs may be destroyed by the year 2050 if the present rate of destruction continues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The International Coral Reef Initiative deemed 2008 as the International Year of the Reef. It established a global campaign to raise awareness about the value and importance of coral reefs and their threats to sustainability. The effort also aims to mobilize action to develop and implement innovative solutions and strategies to protect and preserve this important natural resource.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's very important for the United States to lend its support and resources to this effort. I would also say it's very important for the Congress to complete its work on another piece of legislation that my friend and I backed, the Tropical Forest and Coral Reef Conservation Act, <bill type="h" number="2185">H.R. 2185</bill>. My colleague, Mr. Baird, and I supported this resolution, which is based on legislation coauthored by myself and Mr. Hastings of Florida. It would offer a key "debt for nature swaps" in  developing countries to protect key coral reefs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This legislation was based on work by my previous colleague, the former Member from Ohio, Rob Portman. We worked together since the late 1980s to pioneer a new strategy to support international ecology; that is, offering reductions for the debt of developing nations in return for investments in protecting key ecosystems. Using this technique, we created the largest park in the Western Hemisphere, the Beni Biosphere Reserve in Bolivia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All combined, debt-for-nature swaps have now saved an area 50 times larger than Yellowstone National Park. The key addition of the Tropical Forest and Coral Conservation Act is to extend this debt-for-nature authority to the Department of the Treasury to protect coral reefs. This legislation passed the House overwhelmingly on October 9, 2007, but still remains pending in the Senate. Like so many other things, we would like to see the Senate complete the good work of the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hope is that by passing this legislation we continue to call attention on the attack of coral reefs across the world, on their critical role in preserving the biological diversity of the world, and especially the United States and its Caribbean coastline, and, most importantly, to pass the Tropical Forest and Coral Reef Conservation Act, so that we can offer more than just help on a resolution, that we can have visible support to developing nations so that they can protect their coral reefs,  much as the United States should do on our own shores. I thank the gentleman from Washington.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Mr. Kirk for his leadership on this and thank him for mentioning Representative Portman, who is really a champion of efforts to preserve the global environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is entirely appropriate that we do this today, on Earth Day. I wore a tie which my wife gave me for Christmas which has a picture of my twin 3-year-old boys on it. When we talk preserving rain forests or preserving coral reefs, I think all of us have this commitment, that our children and our grandchildren should one day be able to enjoy these. But if we do not act promptly, quite frankly, I fear that they will not be able to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have witnessed firsthand the degradation of some of what were the most the magnificent reefs on Earth. If you did not know what they are supposed to look like, you might not recognize the difference. But when you go underwater and things that are supposed to be there are not, species of fish, certain types of corals, gone; when you see corals that have been knocked over; when you see bleaching of almost every coral you see; when you see areas where marine anchors have been dragged across them;  when you see areas where excessive human pressure in the form of divers and other things have damaged the reefs; when you see invasive species that are devouring some of the creatures that should be there; when you see runoff from nearby rivers; that is what is happening already. As populations grow, as temperatures increase,  as ocean acidification</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By recognizing the International Year of the Reef, I hope we can follow what Mr. Kirk said and urge Congress to take more actions to protect these valuable resources. I am proud that we can cosponsor this in a bipartisan fashion, and I will urge passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400247" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400011" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma, I thank Mr. Kirk and all the cosponsors of this resolution. Again, this resolution is somewhat of a symbolic act. What we really need to do in addition to this is support the various efforts, both nationally and internationally, to preserve these magnificent resources for generations yet to come and for the entire world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time and would yield back the balance of my time and urge a "yes" vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, <bill type="hr" number="1112">H. Res. 1112</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
