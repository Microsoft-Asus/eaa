  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 12, 2007 in New York, NY, Omar Willock attacked Roberto Duncanson, a gay man, on the street in Crown Heights. Willock allegedly yelled anti-gay slurs at Duncanson when they passed each other on the street. Later, Willock encountered Duncanson again and started a fist fight, eventually stabbing Duncanson. Willock is being held without bail and is charged with a hate crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew Shepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
