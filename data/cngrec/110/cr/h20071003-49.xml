    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Foundation for a Fit Nation Act, legislation to establish the National Physical Fitness and Sports Foundation which would fund the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the undisputed benefits of physical activity, most Americans continue to lead alarmingly inactive lifestyles. Studies by the Center for Disease Control show that more than 50 percent of American adults do not get enough physical activity to provide health benefits, and 24 percent are not active at all in their leisure time. According to the CDC, 61.5 percent of children between the ages of 9 and 13 do not participate in any organized physical activity outside of school; however, the American  Heart Association found that schools are cutting back on physical education, the best method to combat childhood obesity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the United States, obesity among both children and adults has become a problem of epidemic proportions. The number of Americans who are overweight and obese is staggering. The American Obesity Association reported 127 million overweight adults in the United States. The most disturbing statistics, however, revolve around the growing rates of obesity of American children. The Department of Health and Human Services predicts that 20 percent of American youth will be obese by the year 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford to ignore these statistics any longer. We owe it to ourselves and our Nation to support a healthy lifestyle for our constituents. We should be especially cognizant of the importance of instilling in our young people an appreciation of the value of maximizing physical fitness. The creation of the National Foundation on Physical Fitness serves as an important first step towards reaching these goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, a part of the Department of Health and Human Services, is an advisory committee created in 1982 to promote physical activity and fitness in the United States. Currently, the President's Council on Physical Fitness operates on a shoestring budget, a mere $2.1 million, a figure which is vastly incommensurate with the importance of the PCPF mission. The Council is among several departments within the Center for Disease Control which are eligible  to receive private contributions, however it is currently not authorized to solicit contributions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Foundation for a Fit Nation Act is passed, it would direct the President's Council on Physical Fitness to establish a nonprofit foundation designed to promote and encourage the solicitation of private contributions as an independent source of funding for the Council. This budget increase would allow the President's Council on Physical Fitness to expand its scope and activities with no cost to taxpayers. This bill would help further an important national goal, encouraging and fostering  physical fitness and well-being through three specific measures:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, establishing the nonprofit National Physical Fitness and Sports Foundation to promote and improve physical fitness and sports programs in conjunction with the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports;  second, allowing the Foundation to solicit, receive and administer private contributions for the President's Council;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>and third, establishing a bipartisan nine-member board of directors to oversee the Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Physical activity is not only vitally important for our health, but serves as an enjoyable means for the development of commitment, perseverance and teamwork, all of which foster strong societies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation which would provide a private source of funding for an organization critical to the well-being of our constituents.</paragraph>
