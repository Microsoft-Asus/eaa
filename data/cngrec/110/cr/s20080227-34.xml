    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize a small business from my home State of Maine that has revolutionized the health snack food market. Living Nutz, a company that sells all-natural, organic nuts and seeds in a variety of delicious flavors, provides its customers with delicious treats that are exceedingly nutritious without sacrificing an ounce of taste.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seth Leaf Pruzansky and Davy Pruzansky, brothers who founded Living Nutz in 2002 in the basement of their house in Bowdoinham, ME, represent the hard work and passionate drive that go into small businesses in Maine and across the Nation. It takes Living Nutz's core group of seven employees about a week to clean, season, and prepare nuts for distribution to retail stores throughout the United States and Canada, as well as for sales through Living Nutz's website. From almonds to walnuts and raisins  to pumpkin seeds, Living Nutz offers 19 varieties, including sweet ones like Banana Bread and Cina-Pecan-Bun, and spicy ones like Lemon Tahini Twist and Spicy Onion Garlic. The company is also certified by the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association, ensuring both the quality and authenticity of its snacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Living Nutz employs a time-intensive process to produce several thousand pounds of nuts each week. First, the nuts are soaked overnight in water. Then, the next morning, employees place the nuts in large bowls and add all-natural flavoring. The nuts are finally placed into dehydrators for 5 days before being packaged and shipped. The Pruzansky brothers believe that the soaking method delivers a more desirous product, and one that is easier to digest. They say that these "living nuts" are significantly  richer in enzymes and nutrients than nuts that are cooked. In the end, this lengthy procedure yields healthy and taste-filled nuts, as well as repeat customers and devoted fans of the company.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Living Nutz recently played a cameo role in the 2008 Screen Actors Guild awards, as the Guild selected the company to contribute 1,500 bags of its mixed nuts for the actors' and attendees' gift bags. What makes this occasion so unique is that the Screen Actors Guild actually approached the Pruzansky brothers with the opportunity, instead of vice versa. As a result of this exposure, the brothers hope to take on new customers and even celebrity clientele, and are seeking to expand by adding new  facilities, equipment, and employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Pruzansky brothers and Living Nutz are symbols of Maine's great small business achievements. They have proven beyond a doubt that healthy food can taste great. The brothers' unique spin on healthy food, combined with their great sense of business skills, has made Living Nutz such a successful company. Therefore, I congratulate the company on its success from Maine to Hollywood, and wish everyone at Living Nutz the best for years to come.</paragraph>
