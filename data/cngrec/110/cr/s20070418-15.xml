  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak in favor of <bill type="s" number="378">S. 378</bill>, the Court Security Improvement Act. But before I do, I wish to address remarks made this morning by the majority whip, the distinguished Senator from Illinois, for whom I have a lot of respect, but I have to tell you, I disagree with those comments, and I wish to take a few moments to explain why.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his comments, the Senator repeated the theme that Republicans were stopping debate on the floor and not allowing bills to be debated. I disagree with him, and I believe nothing could be farther from the truth. The truth is, as I see it, the majority has tried to force things through the Senate, and they have done so in a way that has denied the minority an opportunity to offer amendments and to allow this body, the so-called world's greatest deliberative body, to  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="4656">S4656</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This morning, the Democratic whip talked about our Founders' intent that "minority rights would always be respected." In this body, minority rights are not being respected. That is the problem. So we have no choice but to assert the last protection against majority tyranny; that is, to object or vote against invoking cloture or closing off debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past, the majority has used cloture when necessary to move a bill forward, after debate has been exhausted, but the minority refuses to allow movement on the legislation. I think that is a perfectly legitimate use of the cloture motion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By this date in the 109th Congress--the Congress just preceding the current Congress--Republicans, when they were in the majority, had filed cloture four times. In the 108th Congress--the immediately preceding Congress--at this point in time, when Republicans were in the majority, Republicans had filed cloture five times. In the 107th Congress, Republicans only filed cloture one time at this point in time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By comparison, since the Democrats have now become the new majority in the Senate, Democrats have filed cloture 22 times. The question naturally arises: Why are Democrats using this divisive tactic so frequently to close off debate?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I think my colleague from Illinois disclosed the reason this morning when he stated:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ultimately, they will be held accountable for their strategy. That is what elections are all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the view from this Senator, from my perspective, the Democrats are using this tactic to paint Republicans as obstructionists, when the exact opposite is true. The new Democratic majority in the Senate is refusing to allow full and fair debate on issue after issue and, more importantly, denying us an opportunity to offer amendments on important legislation and to simply have an up-or-down vote on those amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can tell you, from my perspective, Republicans do not enjoy the procedural clash any more than Democrats do. But it is necessary to protect this institution and, even more importantly, necessary to protect the rights afforded in the Senate to the minority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been eager to engage in full debate, and we understand the rules that majorities will prevail when majorities have an opportunity to vote. But the rules do not permit the new majority, the Democrats, to unilaterally set the terms for the debate. Until the Democratic majority recognizes all Members of this body have the right to debate legislation, to offer amendments, and to have votes on those amendments, we will continue in this standoff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is true, I believe, that only the majority--the new Democratic majority--can fix this problem by simply allowing full debate to go forward and by allowing up-or-down votes on amendments on the Senate floor, which requires discussions, which requires negotiations, and, yes, it requires compromise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Filing cloture--closing off debate--is an intensely aggressive move. It says: We do not want to hear your opinions. We do not want to hear your views. We do not want to consider your ideas on how to improve the legislation on the floor of the Senate. We want to shut down the debate, and we want to shove this legislation through the Senate. It is a "my way or the highway" approach to legislation. And do you know what. It does not work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would point out--and I guess it is fair to say if you have been in the Senate long enough--and I have not--but I have been told, if you have been in the Senate long enough, you will find yourself, at some points in your career, on the side of the majority, and at other times you will find yourself on the side of the minority. It is the way it works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Congress, when Democrats were in the minority, they insisted that the filing of cloture turned the Senate into the House of Representatives--a refusal to allow open and broad debate, with hard majority rule. Here they are now, though, attempting to cut off debate at, it seems, almost every possible turn. It is the reason--and this is the consequence of it; it is not just complaining about it; this is the consequence that has a very real impact on the American people because the new majority,  the Democratic majority, has refused an opportunity for full and fair debate and votes on amendments--that is the reason why Democrats have not sent any real legislation to the President for his signature after 3 months in power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have chosen the hard edge of party politics instead of bipartisanship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Democratic friends have chosen to pursue this agenda driven by campaign rhetoric instead of seeking the broad middle ground and trying to negotiate and to pass legislation on behalf of the American people. It is true that Democrats won the last election--and my congratulations to them--on a message of bipartisanship, on a message of, let's get things done. But their choices to date have not reflected any effort to seriously reach across the aisle to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One example that comes to mind is on Iraq. My colleague from Illinois claimed:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were stopped, stopped by the Republican minority. They would not allow us to go to the substance of that debate. They didn't want the Senate to spend its time on the floor considering a resolution, going on record as to whether we approve or disapprove of the President's action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, completely the opposite occurred. Republicans on this incredibly important debate asked only that we be allowed to discuss the issue fully, and the Democratic majority repeatedly attempted to ram through their resolution without offering any alternatives or any opportunity for alternative resolutions to be considered and voted on. We explained this on the Senate floor over and over during that discussion, but our colleagues in the majority simply turned a deaf ear to our concerns.  When they finally allowed several options to be considered, we were able to have a full debate we had been asking for all along, and then the process moved forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would point out that was on the 20th iteration of the resolutions on Iraq before we had an opportunity to have that debate, a vote, and to move the process forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague from Illinois repeated several times this morning his hope that we could "find some ways to establish bipartisan cooperation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my colleague, there is a way to do that. The majority must stop trying to ram legislation through and allow us to debate openly and to file relevant amendments and allow an up-or-down vote on those amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague from Illinois talked about the "do-nothing Congress" of last year--that was his phraseology--and placed sole blame for the current majority's lack of accomplishments on the minority's refusal to invoke cloture or close off debate. The Washington Post just this morning reported that only 26 percent of the public thinks the current Democratic majority in Congress has accomplished "a great deal" or "a good amount."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, this approach to legislating has not produced a single piece of significant legislation so far in this Congress due to the lack of bipartisanship and due to the lack of opportunity the minority has had to fully participate in the debate and shaping of legislation. Of the 17 laws enacted this Congress, 10 of those are naming of Federal properties. Let me say that again. Of the 17 pieces of legislation enacted in this Congress so far, 10 of them involve naming of Federal properties,  Federal buildings, post offices and the like. Not one of the "six for '06" campaign promises has been passed by Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority, to be sure, is blaming the minority for the lack of progress here based on the result of cloture votes, but let's look at the facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the 9/11 bill, the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, the House and the Senate passed different bills. Democratic leadership in neither body has brought up the other's bill so that those might be resolved in a conference committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the minimum wage bill, the House and the Senate passed different versions, but no conferees have been appointed by either body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the emergency war supplemental, perhaps the most urgent piece of legislation we could possibly pass and send to the President to support the troops who are in harm's way as I speak, the House and the Senate passed different versions of the bill. The House, fresh off of a 2-week recess, has yet to appoint conferees to start working out  the differences between the bills to get funding to our troops. This is especially damaging and reckless, considering  the majority is insisting we send a bill to the President that has a timeline for withdrawal, a provision that has caused the President to promise to veto that legislation. That means before the troops can get the money they need--in other words, to get them the equipment they need during this war--before we can get them the money, we have to come up with a bill the President will sign. Yet the Democratic majority has continued to play politics and stall the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On stem cell research, no conferees have been appointed. The same for the budget. The same for lobbying reform. The list goes on and on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The distinguished Senator from Illinois, the Democratic whip, explained that due to the numbers in this body:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On any given day, if we're going to pass or  consider important legislation, it has to be bipartisan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we're going to be constructive in the United States Senate, we need much more bipartisan cooperation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He continued, saying:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should come together, Democrats and Republicans, and compromise and cooperate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And asking,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Isn't it time we really start out on a new day in the Congress trying to find bipartisan ways to cooperate and solve the real problems that face our country?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To that I say amen. It is past time for the new majority in this body to stop acting like they are Members of the House of Representatives who are going to be able to force their will by a simple majority through the Senate because this is not the House. This is the Senate. The only way we are going to be able to get any legislation passed is through bipartisan cooperation. The only way we are going to get that cooperation is to meet in the middle somehow, to debate as our constituents would  expect us to debate, to take positions--yes, firmly held positions--based on our convictions. But then ultimately we need to have votes on amendments and votes on legislation and let the majority prevail. Let's send the bills to the President for his signature. That is the way it is supposed to work. That is the way it has not been working, but we know the way forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to tell my colleagues that I and my Republican colleagues would welcome the opportunity to sit down on a bipartisan basis and to reach a consensus on important issues such as how to preserve our entitlement programs, including Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare by protecting their long-term solvency. How do we avoid passing the bills incurred by the baby boomer generation on down to our children and grandchildren? How can we expand health care access to more Americans? How can we  solve our broken immigration system, along with the broken borders that pose a national security risk to each and every American citizen? After all, I have to believe that is the reason we ran for public office. That is the reason we wanted to be elected to serve in the Senate--whether we are a Republican or a Democrat--to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the first 100 days, the Congress is, again, at a fork in the road. So far the new majority has taken the path of partisanship, but we know that will not get us down the road to progress. I hope during the second 100 days of this new Congress, the new majority will pause and decide to take the road less traveled--the road of cooperation and accomplishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to speak briefly on the Court Security Improvement Act, a bill of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. As we have already heard, this bill is designed to address the critical issue of the security of our judges and courthouse personnel. I have to add as a personal note, this is not a matter of just some academic interest to me. I believe I am correct in that I am the only current Member of the Senate who has served as a member of the judiciary, in my case for 13 years in  our State court system in Texas, both at the trial bench and at the Texas Supreme Court level. So this is more than a matter of academic interest to me. Protecting our men and women who personify the rule of law and all that it means is very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The dedicated men and women who work in America's courthouses, from the judges to the court reporters to the bailiffs, preside each day over difficult, contentious, and sometimes very emotional disputes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These public servants, just like our police, are placed in harm's way by the very nature of their jobs. They fulfill essential roles that keep our democracy running smoothly, and I have the greatest respect for the people who try to do this job and try to do it well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, violence directed at public servants is on the rise, from escalating violence against police officers to courthouse attacks--including in my State of Texas--these despicable actions threaten the administration of justice and threaten our ability to invoke the rule of law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress has the power, and now we must exercise it, to ensure that certain and swift punishment awaits those who engage in these unconscionable acts of violence. The administration of justice--indeed, the health of our very democracy--depends on our ability to attract dedicated public servants to work at our courthouses. So we must do everything in our power to provide adequate security to these men and women who are too often targeted for violence or harassment simply because of the position  they hold and the decisions they are called upon to make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former attorney general in my State, I had the responsibility of defending sentences on appeal of certain defendants who had been found guilty of violent acts. So I am acutely aware of the devastating effects criminal acts of violence have on not only the victims themselves but also on their families. Because I also used to be a judge, I am fortunate to have a number of close personal friends who continue to serve on our benches and work at our courthouses. I personally know judges and their  families who have been victims of violence, and I have grieved with those victims and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our judges are impartial umpires of the law. We know they cannot help but disappoint some people because that is what they do--they make decisions. They determine winners and losers. Judges, witnesses, and courthouse personnel must not face threats and violence for simply doing their job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The protection of the men and women who compose our judicial system and serve the public and law enforcement is essential to the proper administration of justice in our country. This important bill takes big steps toward providing additional protections on these dedicated public servants. I urge my colleagues to give it their full support.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="SUPREME COURT RULING ON ABORTION BAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning, I heard my friend and colleague, Senator Brownback, on the floor speaking about the decision of the Supreme Court. He and I both chair the Senate's Cancer Coalition, so it has been a great pleasure for me to work with him. But we have very different views when it comes to a woman's right to choose, and I would like to rise today to express my concern and deep dismay regarding the Supreme Court's decision in the case of Gonzales v. Carhart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This judgment today is a major strike against a woman's right to choose. The Court, in this case, by a narrow 5-to-4 margin, has essentially enacted the first Federal abortion ban in this country and has struck down a primary requirement of Roe v. Wade--protection of the health of a mother.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In her dissent, Justice Ginsburg wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's decision is alarming. It refuses to take Casey and Stenberg seriously. It tolerates, indeed applauds, Federal intervention to ban nationwide a procedure found necessary and proper in certain cases by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists. It blurs the line firmly drawn in Casey between pre-viability and post- viability abortions. And for the first time since Roe, the court blesses a prohibition with no exception safeguarding a woman's health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is simply shocking. It is shocking because this can affect any second-trimester abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just 7 years ago, the Supreme Court struck down this very ban in Stenberg v. Carhart in the year 2000. It struck it down out of concern that it did not provide adequate protections for a woman's health and that the law enacted was too vague. The Federal courts, the Fifth and the Ninth Circuits, have all examined this and opposed it. No Federal Court has upheld this abortion ban until today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, what has changed in the 7 years? The answer is nothing, except the composition of the Court. The additions of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito have accomplished what the Bush administration has sought from its earliest days--a court willing to further restrict a woman's right to choose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When they appeared before the Judiciary Committee during their confirmation hearings, both Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito affirmed their respect for stare decisis as preeminent and a controlling factor. In these hearings, Chief Justice Roberts said, and I quote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People expect that the law is going to be what the court has told them the law is going to be. And that's an important consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Justice Alito said, and I quote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've agreed, I think numerous times during these hearings, that when a decision is reaffirmed, that strengthens its value as stare decisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With Justice O'Connor no longer on the Court, the majority of Justices ignored what Senator Specter referred to as "super precedent" in these hearings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Justice Ginsburg points out:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Court admits that "moral concerns" are at work, concerns that could yield prohibitions on any abortions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She continues:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, the Court deprives women of the right to make an autonomous choice, even at the expense of their safety. This way of thinking reflects ancient notions about women's place in the family and under the Constitution--ideas that have long since been discredited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Court, now filled with Bush appointees, is replacing the judicial precedent that they promised to respect for their definition of morality. That is where I see us as being today. With this ruling, the Supreme Court has substituted the medical decisions of politicians for that of doctors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Congressional findings of the legislation creating this ban, as well as the majority opinion of the Court, politicians and Justices decided what procedures are medically necessary and which are not. Justice Kennedy wrote, in today's majority decision, that the Court assumed the abortion ban would "be unconstitutional if it subjected women to significant health risks." He goes on to declare "safe medical options are available."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, doctors who perform these procedures disagree. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the group that represents more than 90 percent of all OB/GYN specialists in the country, assembled an expert panel that identified several specific instances in which this procedure, intact dilation and extraction, has meaningful safety advantages over other medical options.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The procedure is safer for women with serious underlying medical conditions, including liver disease, bleeding and clotting disorders, and compromised immune systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Experts also testified that this procedure is significantly safer for women carrying fetuses with certain abnormalities, including severe hydrocephalus. That is when the head fills with water and is very often larger than the body. In these rare and heartbreaking cases in which a woman learns that something has gone tragically wrong in a pregnancy she very much wanted, no woman should be forced to bear the added burden of undergoing a medical procedure that is not the safest option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The decision today unquestionably breaks new ground. I am extremely concerned that this has opened the door to a further judicial interference in what should be private medical decisions made by women, their partners, their religious beliefs, and their doctors. With this decision, the Roberts Court is signaling a new willingness to uphold additional restrictions on abortion, even those that do not expressly protect a woman's health. This is dangerous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Roberts Court has also opened the door for a major change in how it will determine whether a law unconstitutionally restricts a woman's rights. Generally, laws have been struck down when they are unconstitutional on their face, because if a law is unconstitutional for 10 people or 10 million people, then it should not stand. The Court is turning that analysis on its head. The Court's opinion today says it may uphold laws, even when they may be unconstitutional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This means that in the future a woman could be put in an untenable situation. A woman facing a health crisis needs to act within days or weeks but instead would need to depend on the legal system. Let me give you an example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A woman learns her pregnancy has gone tragically wrong and her health is at risk. She is told by the doctor that there exists a medical procedure that would help her, but it is banned. The alternatives will risk her health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She has to go to court and argue that her constitutional rights, in this specific instance, have been violated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know the wheels of justice spin slowly. It is doubtful the system could respond in a timely manner to a woman in this kind of crisis. If she can prove her case, she might be allowed to have the procedure, but the ban itself would still remain in place, requiring the next woman in a similar situation to have to successfully demonstrate that the law is unconstitutional. This is amazing. The Court, in effect, is requiring that women's health be at risk until it deems enough women have demonstrated  the negative impact of the law on them. Requiring this type of legal challenge to any restriction on abortion will impact women in the most vulnerable situations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like, for a moment, to quote Justice Ginsburg. She points out:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those views, this Court made clear in Casey, "are no longer consistent with our understanding of the family, the individual, or the Constitution." ..... Women, it is now acknowledged, have the talent, capacity, and right "to participate equally in the social life of this Nation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this, incidentally, she is quoting Sandra Day O'Connor in places in an earlier decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their ability to realize their full potential, the Court recognized, is intimately connected to "their ability to control their reproductive lives." ..... Thus, legal challenges to undue restrictions on abortion procedures do not seek to vindicate some generalized notion of privacy; rather, they center on a woman's autonomy to determine her life's course, and thus to enjoy equal citizenship stature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In keeping with this comprehension of the right to reproductive choice, the Court has consistently required that laws regulating abortion, at any stage of pregnancy and in all cases, safeguard a woman's health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is now out the window. It is monumental.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, I remember what it was like when abortion was illegal in America. It was when I was a college student at Stanford. I watched the passing of the plate to collect money so young women could go to Tijuana for an abortion. I knew a woman who ended her life because she was pregnant. In the 1960s, while abortion was still illegal, as a member of the California Board of Terms and Parole, I sentenced women convicted of illegally performing abortions. I saw the morbidity that they caused  by their procedures. It was barbaric in those days. So I am very concerned with this ruling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Court is taking the first major step back to these days of 30, 40 years ago. Young women today have not had these experiences. They have lived only in an era in which the Court recognized their autonomy, their right to make their own medical decisions. If I were a young woman today, I would be incredibly concerned that this era is drawing to a close. The threat on reproductive freedom is no longer theoretical. Today it is very real. All those who care about protecting a woman's right to privacy  should take notice and make their voices heard.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate very much the minority allowing us to move to this bill, this most important bill, dealing with court security. But here we go again; nothing happening on it. I am willing to have Democrats and Republicans debate these amendments. There have been some that have been filed but not offered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just left a meeting in my office with the head of the U.S. Marshals Service. His name is John Clark. He indicated to me, among other things, that this year there has been a 17-percent increase in the threats against our Federal judges, Supreme Court Justices, and all our other Federal judges; about 11,000, I think that is what he told me. I may have that number a little bit wrong; I just left him a minute ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is important legislation. It allows our Federal judges not to have to list the names of their children, where they live, where the individual judge lives. We had in Illinois a terrible situation where one of these disgruntled defendants in a criminal case went to some judge's home and waited for the family to come home and killed them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to move this bill. I don't want a hue and cry from the minority that we are not allowing amendments; we want amendments. If people want to amend this bill, let them do it. But I am going to file cloture on this bill tonight for a Friday cloture vote. We have got to complete legislation around here. We cannot come here each day and sit around looking at each other. We should be doing some legislating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If people do not like this bipartisan bill that is now before the Senate, offer an amendment to change it. I am not going to give my speech--I have given it too many times--on our being thwarted in efforts to move forward on improving the intelligence services of this country. I don't need to give a speech about our inability to negotiate for lower prices of prescription drugs. But we are now on court security. I had to file cloture on that. After cloture was invoked, they allowed us to move  to the bill, saving us 27 hours or 28 hours on it. I do not think it is appropriate that we stand around here today and tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a bill that is bipartisan to its very core, a competitiveness bill. Senator Bingaman, a Democrat, and Senator Alexander, a Republican, have worked on this bill. This is their pride and joy. It is the legislation that will improve this country's ability to be more competitive scientifically. I want to move to that bill and finish it this week. I cannot while this is still around with nothing being done on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I alert everyone within the sound of my voice, if you don't like this bill, come and amend it. Lay down an amendment and we will debate it, we will table it, we will approve it, we will vote, and it won't be passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But our judges, our U.S. Marshals, our U.S. attorneys need this. In my heart I so understand the importance. I said this morning here, this legislation will also help State courts, not only Federal courts. In Washoe County, Reno, NV, a divorce proceeding was going forward. A very rich man, quite frankly, didn't like what was happening in the divorce proceeding, so this man killed his wife in her home--they were divorced, his ex-wife. The child was in the house, and he took her in the garage,  slit her throat, killed her, took the car, drove to a garage, took his hunting rifle, and from 200 yards from a parking lot shot through a window and hit the judge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That window should have had bulletproof glass in it. It didn't. This bill will allow local jurisdictions to have the ability to obtain items such as bulletproof glass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are living in a violent society. We have to, with our judiciary, which is so independent and strong, do what we can to protect it. I was in Ecuador with a congressional delegation. The President of that country, when I told him a little story--and we were in the Embassy. The President of Ecuador was standing next to me, and I told him about the 2000 Presidential election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said: You know, that is an interesting election. President Bush got less votes than the person he beat. The matter went to Florida where there was so much confusion and consternation in counting the votes there. The matter worked its way to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court decided that George Bush would be President of the United States. The minute that was done, I said, in Ecuador: George Bush became my President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In our great country, which is ruled by law, not by men, there was not a tire burned, a window broken, a demonstration held, because we are a country of laws, and George Bush became everybody's President. I did not like the decision of the Supreme Court; I disagreed with it. But that is the law, that is the law of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I finished, the President of Ecuador said: I only wish we had a court system like yours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what this bill is all about, to try to have our court system one that is as strong as it has been.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So if my friends on the other side of the aisle come here and say, as they have done on a number of occasions: Well, we didn't have a chance to offer an amendment--we finished this vote early today.

  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="SUPREME COURT RULING ON ABORTION BAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, pending before the Senate at this time is a bill to make our courts safer. This is an issue we take personally in Chicago because in 2005, one of our most respected Federal judges had her mother and husband killed in her home, murdered by an upset individual who didn't like the way he was treated in a courtroom. He stalked her family, invaded her home, killed her aging mother, and husband, who was the love of her life. I know this judge because I appointed her to the  Federal bench. I have met her daughters and I know her close friends in Chicago. I think about her every time the issue of court security comes up. She is a wonderful woman who has devoted her life to public service. She has put in the time that we expect from real professionals. She has done her best to be fair and just. She works hard. We owe her security in the workplace and security for her family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why Senator Obama and I introduced an appropriations bill right after this happened, trying to put some money into the U.S. Marshals Service to protect judges across the United States. That is what this bill is all about. There is nothing partisan about this legislation. There is nothing even controversial about it. This bill should have been passed quickly, sent to the House and approved because it makes a better effort to protect these judges in their homes, gives more resources  to U.S. marshals, puts stiffer penalties in for those who harass and shoot at and kill those who serve us in the judiciary. This is basic common sense. Instead of taking up this bill and passing it quickly, as we should have to get it in place and to put the protections in place, it has been slowed down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of our colleagues is exercising his rights under the Senate rules. I said earlier I will fight for him to have the right to speak it, on any bill, to offer  an amendment to it, to express himself, and to have the Senate decide finally what the decision will be on his amendment. I respect his right to do that. But instead we are going to slow this bill down for 2 days. We will have amendments filed, six, and they are just going to sit on the desk while  the clock runs. Instead of moving to other legislation which is critically important we will just sit here. That is unfair. I don't think that is consistent with what the American people expect of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have called on my colleagues, the one who has six amendments filed and any who have other amendments, please bring them to the floor right now, within the next hour. Let's start the debate right now. Let's set them for a vote as quickly as possible. Let's stop these stall tactics on bills as basic as this, protecting the personal security of judges across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for us to get down to business in the Senate. Look around at all the empty chairs. Look for the person who sponsored the amendments to this bill. You won't find him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for us to get down to business in the Senate. People expect us to. This week has been a pretty horrible week when you look at it. We came in here trying to pass a bill that would authorize intelligence agencies across our Government to make America safer, 16 different intelligence agencies, a bipartisan bill, worked on long and hard by Senator Rockefeller, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and his staff, and Senator Bond and his staff. The bill was ready to  go, a bill which should have passed years ago, stopped in its tracks by the Republican minority that said, no. Vice President Cheney objects to a provision in the bill relative to the interrogation of prisoners; imagine that he would raise that issue again. Therefore, all Republicans, with maybe a couple exceptions, are going to stop debate on the bill. That was strike 1.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Strike 2, a provision to amend the Medicare Prescription Drug Act so that we could have more competition and lower prices for seniors and disabled when they buy drugs. Some agree with it; some disagree. The pharmaceutical industry hates it; it cuts into their profits. It was worth a debate to see whether we could help seniors pay for their drugs and lower prices. But, no, the Republican minority said: No, we are not going to even debate that. We won't let you go to that. It is within their power  to stop us, and they did it again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now comes this bill for court security, and for the third strike this week, the Republicans have said: No, we want to slow you down. We want to run out the clock. We want to put amendments on the table and not call them for consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is becoming increasingly clear what the Republican game plan is. We have seen it this week on three pieces of legislation. We see it with this bill. I have spoken to majority leader Senator Reid who spoke moments ago. We have important business to do. In fact, we have business which is very bipartisan. This bill, which has been slowed down by one Republican Senator, has as cosponsors Senators SPECTER, CORNYN, COLLINS, and HATCH, all Republican Senators. It is a bipartisan  bill. It is not even controversial. Why aren't we doing this? It isn't as if there are other things going on on the Senate floor. We are waiting on the Senators who want to stop or slow down this bill to finally come and do their business. It is not too much to ask. I understand we are all busy. From time to time we have to leave the Hill to go to a committee meeting. I know I filed an</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just joined the majority leader and others in meeting with the President of the United States to talk about the war in Iraq. I am glad we had this meeting. We didn't reach a new agreement or compromise. I wish we had. We started a dialog, and that is important. There were heartfelt emotions expressed at that meeting by many of us on both sides of the issue, by the President, as well as by Senator Reid and myself and many others. Speaker Pelosi was there. The majority leader  of the House, Steny Hoyer, was in attendance, as was Jim Clyborn, the majority whip, and the Republican leadership. We talked about the war in Iraq at length and where we need to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is our belief that if we don't include language in the appropriations bill which says to the Iraqis that we are not going to stay there indefinitely, they are going to drag their feet forever when it comes to making the political reforms that are necessary. We are going to leave our soldiers stuck in the middle of a civil war. Mr. President, 3,311 Americans have died in service to this country while serving in Iraq. These are our best and bravest. They have given their lives, and they continue  to give their lives while we debate and delay. It is time for us to move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggested to the President in the moments that I had to express my point of view, if he won't accept a timetable for starting to bring American troops home, can't we at least hold the Iraqis to the timetable that they have offered us for political reform? They have missed deadline after deadline. They promised to bring their country together. They promised to bring their army into a leadership that will be effective. They have promised to try to resolve the old differences from the Baath Party  under Saddam Hussein. Promise after promise after promise they have failed to keep while our soldiers fight and die every single day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the obvious differences from that meeting, there was one hopeful sign. We started the meeting, and I began by praising President Bush for delivering a speech today at the U.S. Holocaust Museum on the subject of the genocide in Darfur. It was the appropriate venue for the speech. The Holocaust Museum offers a powerful backdrop to consider the horrors of genocide. I am glad the President made this speech. I applaud him for making it. I had hoped that he would be a little bit stronger, but  I understand, speaking personally with the President, that he wants to give new U.N. General Secretary Ban Ki-moon some time to use his office effectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President essentially today, though, by every measure, gave Sudan a final warning, and it is about time. The President stated that within a "short period of time," to use his words, President Bashir of Sudan must take the following steps: Allow the deployment of the full joint African Union-United Nations peacekeeping force in the area of Darfur where somewhere near 400,000 people have been murdered and over 2 million displaced. The President of Sudan must also end support for the Jingaweit  militia, reach out to rebel leaders, allow humanitarian aid to reach the people of Darfur, and end his obstructionism. If he does not, President Bush stated, the United States will respond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the U.S. will tighten economic sanctions on the Sudanese Government and the companies it controls. Second, the President will also levy sanctions against individuals who are responsible for the violence. Third, the U.S. will introduce a new U.N. Security Council resolution to apply multilateral sanctions against the Government of Sudan and impose an expanded arms embargo. This resolution will impose a ban on Sudanese offensive military flights over Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last fall the President's special envoy talked about a January 1st deadline after which the United States would impose sanctions that would cripple the Sudanese oil industry. That deadline is months behind us, and the sanctions the President outlined are not as potent as they might be in terms of truly hitting the oil industry as I hoped they would.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.N. resolution and multilateral sanctions would be a major step forward. If we don't see rapid progress from the Sudanese Government, I urge the President to both introduce the U.N. resolution and to call for a vote. Let's put the countries of the world on notice that they must stand and be on the record on ending this genocide in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said, I understand President Bush is responding to a special request  from U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon who asked for some more time to negotiate. All I can say is, I hope the Secretary General's faith that real progress is being made is justified. At least on paper there has been a breakthrough in the last few days. The Sudanese Government has reportedly agreed to allowing 3,000 U.N. peacekeepers to deploy. But we have had promises like this  in the past and no action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China, Sudan's biggest supporter and biggest customer for its oil, has also started taking mutant, limited, but proactive steps in recent weeks to convince the Sudanese to move forward on peacekeeping. China's Assistant Foreign Minister recently toured refugee camps full of people from Darfur who had fled their homes. That is not a typical stop on a Chinese Government tour, a positive sign that China is not blind to the human rights abuses going on in Sudan. China has reportedly played an important  role recently in urging the Sudanese Government to move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, however, China continues to oppose sanctions even if Khartoum continues to obstruct peacekeeping. The Chinese Defense Minister recently announced that China is interested in developing military cooperation with Sudan, whatever that could possibly mean. As for Sudan, while Khartoum has said it will allow deployment of 3,000 U.N. peacekeepers, a new U.N. report details how the Sudanese Government is flying arms of heavy military equipment into Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This morning's New York Times has photographs of the Sudanese painting their airplanes to appear to be United Nations aircraft and African Union aircraft so that they can deceptively ship arms into this region that will be used to kill innocent people. That is the government we are dealing with in Khartoum. Sudan has promised to allow 3,000 U.N. peacekeepers and their equipment into Darfur. If it keeps the promise this time, it would be a start, but what is needed, as the President said today  at the Holocaust Museum, is the full 21,000 combined U.N.-African Union force with the means and mandate to protect the people of Darfur. The people of Darfur have waited long enough for peace and security and the end of genocide. Now is the time to act.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It says: it is the sense of the Senate that we should not create new spending programs when we have to borrow money to pay for them; that, in fact, we ought to create priorities, that the priorities ought to be the same type of priorities that everybody in this country has to face every day with their own personal budget, that they cannot go out and use their credit card without having a consequence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very simple amendment. I wish to read it thoroughly so everybody understands what the amendment says. It says the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate finds that--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(1) the national debt of the United States of America now exceeds $8,500,000,000,000;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) each United States citizen's share of this debt--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>from the oldest to the youngest--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>is approximately $29,183;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(3) every [penny] that the United States Government borrows and adds to this debt is money [that will be borrowed] from future generations of Americans and from important programs, including Social Security and Medicare on which our senior citizens depend for their retirement security;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also states:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(4) the power of the purse belongs to Congress;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(5) Congress authorizes and appropriates all Federal discretionary spending;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(6) for too long, Congress has simply borrowed more and more money to pay for new spending, while Americans want Congress to live within its means, using the same set of common sense rules and restraints [every American faces] everyday; because in the real world, families cannot follow Congress's example and must make difficult decisions and set priorities on how to spend their limited financial resources. .....</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Would this mean we would not be able to continue to borrow money for the war in Iraq?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>This is a sense of the Senate. I would be happy for us not to borrow money. We had $200 billion a year in waste, fraud, abuse, and duplication outlined by the Federal Financial Management Subcommittee last year. Appropriators refused to look at that, ways to fund it. Mr. President, $200 billion--we could spend $100 billion on the war and $100 billion to lower the deficit. I would be very happy to apply this to everything we do. Every American has to do exactly the same thing with  their own budget every day.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I could continue for a moment, without the Senator losing his right to the floor. I share his concern about expenditures. I wish we were back in the days of President Clinton, where we built up a surplus and started paying down the Federal debt; other than what a Republican-controlled Congress voted for, which has tripled the national debt.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>The Senator makes a great point. The realistic fact is, we decreased the Federal debt $2 billion under the entire Clinton administration. Mr. President, $2 billion. One year we had a true surplus--a true surplus. That was the extent of it. And since then, and before then, we have borrowed the future of our children away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To continue, this resolution states:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(7) it is irresponsible for Congress to authorize new spending for programs that will result in borrowing from Social Security. .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to Social Security recipients, we borrowed $140 billion, last year, from Social Security to pay for things we were not willing to either trim down, make more efficient or eliminate in duplicative programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also are borrowing from foreign governments. That is affecting our financial status. But most importantly, we are borrowing from future generations of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment states:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(b) ..... It is the sense of the Senate that Congress has a moral obligation to offset the cost of new government programs, initiatives, and authorizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very simple. A resolution has no impact of law. It says: We agree, here are the rules under which we ought to operate. It does not bind anybody. It says, if we are going to create new programs, we either ought to find a way where we do not borrow to pay for them or we ought to offset them by eliminating ineffective programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2001, as the Senator rightly noted, the Federal debt per person in this country was $21,000. It has risen almost $10,000 since 2001. A lot of people are quick to dismiss that figure, say it does not matter, we only need to worry about the debt and the deficits as compared to the economic growth in the size of our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A better rule of thumb is how Government growth compares to the growth of wages and earnings. Last fiscal year alone, the real Federal deficit increased in excess of $300 billion--a debt our children and grandchildren will repay. So $7.2 billion was spent each day, or $84,000 was spent per second--per second. If regular Americans must tighten their belts to live within their means, the Federal Government should do the same instead of authorizing new spending without offsetting similar spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year's interest costs alone were 8 percent of the total Federal budget. In contrast, the average American spends about 5 percent of their income as a percentage of their interest costs. The Federal Government spent $226 billion on interest costs alone. According to the Government Accountability Office, by the year 2030, interest will consume 25 percent--25 percent--of the Federal debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So why do I bring this resolution to the floor? I bring the resolution to the floor to make the point that when we authorize new programs, we ought to find the money to pay for them and we ought to reduce programs that aren't effective. We ought to look at the programs that aren't accomplishing what we want them to, we ought to eliminate duplicate programs where one works well and one doesn't work quite so well and put the money into the one that works well so we get good value for our dollars,  and we ought to change the habits under which we work so we can all accomplish what we would like to see.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to see middle-income wages rise in this country at a rate faster than they rise for the wealthy  class. I would like to see opportunity enhanced in this country. I would like to see a balanced budget so we don't steal opportunity from our children and our grandchildren. I don't think most people disagree with that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason we are out here debating this is I had a simple request: Let's just find some deauthorization amendments so that when we bring this new and very needed bill to the floor--and I agree and I think everybody on the Judiciary Committee agrees this is a good bill; it is going to pass--shouldn't we make some hard choices, just like every family makes? Instead, we choose not to. We decide we will pass a new bill. We will add $40 million a year to the cost to run the Government, but we won't  deauthorize anything that is out there that is not working effectively. We won't fix the improper payments that are going on in this country to the tune of about $40 billion--that is billion with a "b." That is a thousand times more in improper payments than this bill costs. We won't do the hard work that is necessary.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I am happy to yield to the Senator. By the way, I enjoyed the Senator's speech on Darfur, and as the Senator from Illinois knows, I agree with him very much. I thank him for his efforts on the genocide that is now occurring in Darfur.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. He has been a stalwart in the effort for Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to read a sentence to the Senator from Oklahoma and ask him what it means. It is a sentence from the underlying bill, which is an authorization bill. It relates to section 105. Here is what it says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to any other amounts authorized to be appropriated for the U.S. Marshals Service, there are authorized to be appropriated for the U.S. Marshals Service to protect the judiciary $20 million for each of the fiscal years 2007 through 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now I would like to ask the Senator this: If we pass this bill authorizing $20 million to be appropriated to the U.S. Marshals Service to protect judges and then do not appropriate the money for that purpose, how much money will come out of the Federal Treasury going to the U.S. Marshals pursuant to this bill?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>You were claiming a reauthorization----</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, reclaiming the floor, here is what it is about. The Senator from Illinois is a great advocate for those who are less fortunate in this country. That is what this is about. It is about changing the habits of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the appropriations process. I understand the authorization process. Changing the habits says we are not going to authorize new programs until we have done our homework on the programs that aren't effective. That is the whole purpose of this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the Senator's consternation with my desire. I understand that most people inside Washington disagree. But I also understand that most people outside of Washington say that if you increase spending--authorized  spending, not appropriated spending but authorized spending--$40 million and never look at what you can deauthorize, whenever we get to a surplus or when we get to a balanced budget, we are going to spend more money. We are not going to make the hard choices. That is exactly what happens. We can disagree with that but, in fact, that is how we got an $8.9 trillion deficit. That is how we ran a $300 billion-plus deficit this year. It is the process. It is the process where we have decided that  authorization has minimal power to influence in this body and that appropriations has all power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My point in making us debate this resolution on this bill and bringing it up is to say: Let's start the process where we start looking, as our oath charges us to do, at what doesn't work. Let's bring a bill that authorizes something that is very good and bring a bill that deauthorizes something that might get funding even though it is not effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will give an example: the COPS Program. It is a very good program. It helps a lot of cities. Why shouldn't it be competitively bid? Why shouldn't the cities with the most need get the help with their police force rather than the cities whose Members put an earmark in for the COPS Program, and any money that doesn't go to true need comes back to the Federal Treasury? Why wouldn't we do that? Because that is hard work. Because we might alienate one group as we do what is best for everybody in  America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the resistance to my efforts in challenging the way we operate in the Senate, and I understand the opposition to my techniques and methods in trying to accomplish that. However, as the Senator from Illinois knows, if I am a champion for anything, I am a champion for making sure we don't waste one penny anywhere. The best way to do that is to start having good habits in how we arrange what we are going to spend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, it is very easy to find offsets in authorization because we have three times as much authorized as we actually spend. So the Senator's point is exactly true, but it doesn't direct us down to the problem. If we get in the habit of making the decision we are going to look at the programs that don't work, we are going to deauthorize the programs that don't work, guess what we will do. We eventually might get rid of the one $1 of every $5 on the discretionary side today that is either  waste, fraud, abuse, or duplication--$1 in $5. No one in this body blows 20 percent of their personal budget on stuff that doesn't mean anything or have any return. Yet in the discretionary budget, everything except Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, that is exactly what we do. It is exactly what</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The point is, let's live like everybody else out there. Let's not take the credit card and not look at the things we really should be looking at. Let's do some extra work. Let's try to accomplish what is best for everybody in this country, no matter what their economic station in life, no matter what their background, no matter what their position is. They all have a limited budget. They have to make choices. They have to make choices, and they have to prioritize things. The Senate doesn't; they  just authorize another bill and never deauthorize anything else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and ask for the yeas and nays.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I respect the Senator from Oklahoma. I respect his fiscal conservatism. I respect his belief that our budget deficit is a source of growing concern for all of us. He says we need to start with good habits. I believe we need to start with the right language. We need to understand what the Senator is asking us to consider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He started by saying that no family in America has the luxury the Federal Government has of spending more than they bring in year after year after year, which is what our deficit does at the Federal level. No argument there. Let me use another family example. My wife and I have raised three children. Occasionally, we have given them some choices. A father could say to his son: You have $200 coming up for your birthday. Here are the choices you can make: You can buy a new suit--it wouldn't be  a bad idea if you are going to go out for an interview--or you can buy that bicycle you have had your eye on for a long time that you want to take to college or I know you want to buy an iPod. OK. Make a choice, but you only get $200. Make one of those choices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Authorization bills put choices on the table, and then the appropriations bills make a choice. It doesn't mean my  son is going to get $600 at the end of the day; he only gets $200. He has to make a choice from the gifts I have authorized. The Senator from Oklahoma is arguing that giving my son a choice of three things means he is going to demand all three and get them. Wrong. It is a matter of discipline when it comes to the appropriations process. The authorization process is not the problem. We could authorize much more than we ultimately spend, and we do, but in the final reckoning, the budget resolution  says you can only spend so much money. You can only spend $200 on your birthday, I say to my son, even though you are being given three authorized choices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when the Senator offers us this sense of the Senate, it sounds an awful lot like pay-go, which is now the process we are following in the Senate which says: If you want to spend some money, you have to find a way to increase a tax or cut spending in other areas. It is pay as you go. But the Senator from Oklahoma applies it to authorizations. It is a different world. Confusing the two is not going to help us reach a balanced budget; confusing the two creates confusion. Authorization is not  appropriation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earmarks can be appropriations. I have seen them. I have done them. I have announced them in press releases. I am happy to do so to bring money back to my State as best I can for good reasons, and I stand by them and defend them. People challenge them. That is the nature of this business as I consider it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is, if I am authorized to have three bridges in Illinois, authorized to have three bridges in Illinois and only have money for one bridge to be appropriated, I have to make a choice. The people in my State have to make a choice. Life is about choices. It is not about what I might choose; it is what I ultimately have to choose--one bridge, one birthday gift. That is the appropriation. That is why this is so different.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ordinarily, this resolution, until it gets to its resolved sense-of-the-Senate clause, is pretty easy to take. I might disagree with some of the rhetoric here and there, but when you end by arguing that an authorization is an expenditure of money, it is just not accurate. It doesn't state what happens here in Congress.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am happy to yield for a question.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Under your premise, only bills that are authorized get funded, correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>But all bills that are authorized do not get appropriated.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Except you are wrong. Last year, $220 billion of unauthorized programs were appropriated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I may--will the Senator yield to me? I am happy to yield back in a moment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Sure.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let's carry your analogy a little further. What has really happened is you give your son $200, but the mandate is--you are going to spend $100 on a broken iPod or a used iPod, and you have $100 to buy down towards a good one, but you mandate that you spend $100 on the bad one. That is the analogy. That is why we ought to deauthorize programs that aren't working. That is why we ought to oversight aggressively every area of the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me take one other exception, and then I will be happy to yield back to the Senator.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Could I interrupt the Senator just to say this: This is getting painfully close to a debate, which rarely occurs on the floor of the Senate, so please proceed.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>I love it. I love to debate the Senator from Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I take a different tact, and the Senator knows that. I look at the oath I took when I came to the Senate. It didn't say "Oklahoma" in it; the Senator's didn't say "Illinois." What the oath says is to defend the Constitution of the United States and do what is best for the country as a whole and in the long term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the Senator--and I admire him greatly--admitted that he plays the game the way it is played. I am telling him that the American people are ready for the game to be played a different way--a totally different way. Part of that is looking at the authority under which we allow money to be spent and recognizing that if we are going to authorize something new, given the jam we are in, all you have to do is talk to David Walker and look at what is going to happen in the next two generations. Don't  we have an obligation to look at the programs that are not authorized?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Would the Senator answer this question: When was the last time he saw a program deauthorized in this body?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am happy to respond. I think the Senator has asked a good question but not the right question. When we fail to appropriate money for an authorized program, we are saying there is a higher priority. We are saying that authorized program may not be as valid or as valuable today as when it was enacted, and we make the choice. The Senator referred to this, and I know he didn't mean to demean the process in saying that I am "playing the game." I don't think I am "playing the game"  when I do the best I can to help the 12 1/2  million people I represent. If the Senator ran into a problem--and occasionally Oklahoma has a challenge--I will be there to help him, too. That is the nature of it. We try to represent our States and also do what is good for the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, if authorization is broken, as the Senator from Oklahoma says, the obvious answer is, either don't appropriate money for it, or when the appropriations bill comes to the floor, strike it and move the money to another program. You have the right to do that as a Senator. But the fact that the options or choices are out there doesn't mean that every one of them is going to be honored and appropriated.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, reclaiming the floor, if I might, the thing that strikes me is the Senator is a wonderful debater, except when he says the appropriators appropriating money on an authorized program--that is great, except the American public needs to know that 22 percent of what we appropriate has never been authorized. Never.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the fact is, we say authorization means something, but it means nothing as far as the appropriations process goes. The real point of this debate is how do we grab hold of this problem, this behemoth of a problem that will face our children and grandchildren in the next 20 to 25 years, and do it in a way that will give us the greatest opportunity for them?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My idea--and obviously many people disagree with it--is I think we ought to start looking at every program. We ought to ask a couple of questions: Can we measure its effectiveness? Is there a metric on it that says this program is supposed to do this? Is there a metric there so we can measure it? I am of the mind to say that if you cannot measure something, you cannot manage it. Ninety percent of the programs have no metric in the Federal Government, so we don't know if they are working.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No. 2, is it a program that is still needed? We don't ever look at the authorizing level. The Senator would have us defer everything to appropriations, and that is what we actually do because 20 percent of what we appropriate is not authorized and everything we authorize isn't appropriated. So, obviously, authorizations are meaningless. So what we should do is eliminate authorizing committees and just have appropriations committees and we will all be on appropriations committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, we should ask, is this still a legitimate function of the Federal Government? When we ran a $300 billion-plus true deficit last year and every State, save one, had big surpluses, should we not ask the question: If we are doing things that really are not the Federal Government's role to do, and we have a deficit and the States have a surplus, should we not let them do it without our fingers taking 15 percent of the money as we send it back?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the Senator will yield, I will make a constructive suggestion, not to make a debate point or anything else, but to serve his purposes. Can I suggest that instead of a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, the Senator from Oklahoma, when an authorization bill comes along, offer a sunset provision to be added to it to say that at a certain period of time this authorization ends and has to be  reauthorized? Would that not serve his purpose?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>As a matter of fact, I did just that on the last 9/11 bill, and the Senator from Illinois voted against it. I voted to sunset it. I actually offered the amendment that said we should sunset it and look at it in 5 years, and the Senator from Illinois disagreed. He thought, no, we should not do that. This Senator must admit that he does have a constructive suggestion. I just wish he had voted that way when we had the amendment up.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>I was reluctant to do this, but I am going to refer to a couple of votes of the Senator from Oklahoma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His amendment was to sunset the entire Department of Homeland Security. Also, on two separate occasions he voted against pay-as-you-go requiring 50 votes. Here are two different rollcalls where the Senator's vote would have made the difference.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>My amendment did not sunset the whole Department of Homeland Security. It was the grants process.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is what keeps our country safe.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>It is made up of how we dole money out to the States rather than looking at the best interests of the country and looking at the risk base for national security and homeland security. I am basically for a true pay-go that says the options are two. One option said the only option is, if we won't cut spending, we will raise taxes. That is a pay-more, not a pay-go. It is pay more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of those votes. I had consternation over it because I want to try to hold to those things. But the pay-go as outlined two times in the language was a vote for pay-more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Will the Senator agree with me that there is waste, fraud, and abuse in the duplication of the Federal Government.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Absolutely.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the Senator agree that since we had a $300 billion-plus deficit last year--$200 billion-plus if we weren't in the war in Iraq--if we took that off the table, would it not make sense for us to try to get rid of the waste, fraud, duplication, and abuse?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Of course. But I include the war in Iraq----</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>It doesn't include the war. Let me finish my point.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>I said I do include the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>It was in there, but say we were not in the war and we were still down to $200 billion--let's take that off the table. Say we have a $200 billion deficit, and we can demonstrate from our subcommittee hearings $200 billion a year in waste, fraud, and abuse. Yet we did nothing about it. We did nothing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have enjoyed my debate with the Senator from Illinois. I ask that we vote on the question at hand. I thank him for his kindness.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I understand Senator Specter may have a comment he wants to make. I respect the Senator's view on the budget, though we disagree. We both understand the seriousness of the deficit. I don't think authorizations are the problem. For that reason, I will vote against this amendment. When we vote on a pay-go amendment, I hope you can join us.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object, and I may, we are about to have a vote in connection with the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma. If we are going to start talking about amendments for a couple of hours and bring up another one, we are not going to get anywhere on the bill for court security, which has been passed twice by this body. So I object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, a great deal of what the Senator from Oklahoma has offered, I agree with; that is, that we ought to live within our means as a society. I have consistently supported constitutional amendments for balanced budgets, to require the Congress to live within its means, like States, cities, and we personally must live within our means. I have supported the line-item veto. I think the transparency for awards, also known as earmarks, will be an improvement of the current  system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with what the Senator from Oklahoma has said about the problems created by the national debt and by the deficit. But the sense-of-the-Senate conclusion, I think, goes further than we can, realistically. The last paragraph says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the sense of the Senate that Congress has a moral obligation to offset the cost of new government programs, initiatives, and authorizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you talk about living within our means and a balanced budget, in the line-item veto, I would agree with that; but when you talk about offsetting the authorizations, that goes to a point that I think goes too far because the legislative process has two steps. One step is the authorization and the second step is the appropriation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is common practice to have authorizations that will be substantially beyond what an appropriation will be. The real decisive factor is what money is appropriated, what money is spent, not what moneys can be authorized. But in structuring programs and authorizations, it is the common practice to put a figure in that is larger than may be used, but it is there for purposes of contingency, if more should be used, so that the real critical factor is the appropriations process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot agree with what the Senator from Oklahoma seeks to accomplish on tying the hands of the authorizers because of the established practice that I think is appropriate. For that reason, I regrettably cannot support what my colleague has offered, although I think the underlying purpose is very valid.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, if this was our Department of Justice authorization bill, these kinds of amendments could certainly be considered.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and that the managers' package be considered and agreed to, and we revert to the pending amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
