    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the President said that critics of escalation have a responsibility, quite frankly, to offer an alternative. Today, Congresswoman LYNN WOOLSEY, Congresswoman MAXINE WATERS and myself will do just that. The Bring the Troops Home and Iraq Sovereignty Restoration Act is a rational alternative to escalation. It will repeal the authorization to use force, fully fund a 6-month withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq, provide economic aid to the Iraqi Government and fully  fund the VA health care system for all veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will also prohibit permanent military bases in Iraq and U.S. control over Iraq's oil resources, and it will create a joint bipartisan committee to investigate how our Nation came to be misled into this unnecessary war and ensure that it never happens again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to bring this war and occupation to an end. It is time for military measures to be replaced by diplomacy. It is time to take the targets off our troops' backs and bring them home now. I am proud to say that today we will be introducing legislation to do just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Congresswoman LYNN WOOLSEY, Congresswoman MAXINE WALTERS of the Progressive Caucus and the Out of Iraq Caucus for their leadership.</paragraph>
