    <paragraph>Mr. President, North Dakota has long maintained strong ties with our Nation's military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My State is home to two Air Force bases and the Nation's best Air National Guard unit. More of our young people volunteer to serve their country in the military than nearly any other State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In North Dakota, our commitment to our troops does not end when we welcome them home from war. We also  have a strong tradition of honoring our veterans. In fact, when I started a North Dakota Veterans History Project 5 years ago to record the stories of our veterans for future generations, the outpouring of interest resulted in more than 1,500 interviews.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I did not find it surprising that when the WDAY television station based in Fargo, ND, organized an "Honor Flight" to bring veterans of World War II to Washington, D.C., it had an overabundance of donors and too few seats to accommodate all the veterans. But WDAY has chartered a flight to Washington next month and will bring 100 veterans of World War II to see the memorial on our National Mall that was built in their honor. My colleagues, Senator Conrad and Congressman Pomeroy,  and I will host a reception for them in the historic Russell Caucus Room.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can't think of a better way to pay tribute to these heroes than this trip to our Nation's Capital. Many of them will visit for the first time the World War II Memorial that is a powerful symbol of the sacrifice they made for the safety and freedom of our country and the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a group of Americans who were appropriately labeled "the greatest generation" by Tom Brokaw. I remember reading his book some years ago and marveling again at the dedication those young men, and some young women, expressed to this country. They dedicated their lives to defeating the fascism and Nazism that threatened the peace and prosperity of the world. They kept the free world free. Many paid for it with the ultimate sacrifice--their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several years ago, I was reminded just how important their sacrifice was when I was part of a congressional delegation involved in discussions with members of the European Parliament. We had been discussing some differences between the United States and the Europeans for some time. It was at this point that a European delegate stopped me and said, "Mr. Senator, I want you to understand how I feel about your country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said, "In 1944, I was 14 years old and standing on a street corner in Paris, France, when the U.S. Liberation Army marched in and freed my country from the Nazis."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said, "A young American soldier reached out his hand and gave that 14-year-old boy an apple. I will go to my grave remembering that moment. You should understand what your country means to me, to us, to my country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To me, this man's story is a testament to the respect and admiration people around the world feel for our country. And this is because the "greatest generation"--those same men and women who will visit Washington next month--were willing to leave their homes so many years ago and travel around the world to fight an enemy that threatened our freedom. They did it without complaint and without question. They loved their country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a verse that goes, "When the night is full of knives, and the lightning is seen, and the drums are heard, the patriots are always there, ready to fight and ready to die, if necessary, for freedom."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The men and women who will travel to Washington next month are patriots who answered when duty called. The Honor Flight is an expression of our thanks for the sacrifice they made that is too large to ever fully repay.</paragraph>
