  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor my good friend Edward M. Smith, a man for whom I have great respect and admiration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ed has been involved in the labor movement in Illinois for more than 40 years. He is deeply committed to the working families of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a leader in the Laborers' International Union, Ed has worked to ensure workers earn a living wage, good benefits and the opportunity to advance and better their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is stepping down as Midwest Regional Manager of the Laborers' International Union of North America, Vice President of Laborers' International and Assistant to the General President, to become President of the Union Labor Life Insurance Company, labor's own insurance and financial services company.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those who may not be familiar with the Laborers, they are the men and women who do the hard, dangerous work of building our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ed literally grew up in the labor movement. He was only 13 when he joined Laborers' Local 773 in Cairo, IL. He worked his way through school as a construction craft laborer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was elected business manager of his local union in 1976 at the young age of 21. A decade later, he was elected president of the Southern Illinois Laborers' District Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1994, Ed was elected Midwest Regional Manager of the Laborers' International, leading more than 50,000 union members. Two years later, he was elected Vice President of the Laborers' International Union and became Assistant to the General President of the Union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Laborers' International Union is one of the fastest-growing unions of construction workers and Ed oversaw over 30 successful organizing campaigns, mainly in the public sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ed was the first member of the Laborers' International Union to graduate from the National Labor College with a bachelors degree. Ed also graduated from the Harvard University Trade program and from Shawnee College. In 1992, he received Shawnee College's first outstanding alumni award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Ed fought for Illinois' working families, he raised his own family with his wife Betty. He has two children, daughter Jordan and son Matt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ed also devotes a great deal of his life to charitable organizations. He has been a major benefactor to the Therapy Center in Carterville, IL, an organization that assists physically disabled children. He also serves as a board member of the I Can Read Program, for children with reading and learning disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his many union roles, Ed is well respected for his leadership with the Illinois State Board of Investment, the Illinois Department of Labor Advisory Board, and the National Alliance for Fair Contracting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ed Smith is a big man with a big heart. It says something about him that he has risen to such prominence in the American labor movement without ever leaving his hometown of Cairo, IL and without ever losing touch with his Midwestern roots and values. While he has remained in southern Illinois, the effects of his work can be seen and felt throughout our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my friend Ed Smith begins the next chapter in his life, I want to congratulate him on his retirement from Laborers' International Union and thank him for over 40 years of dedication to working men and women. I wish him the best in his new role as president of Union Labor Life Insurance Company as he continues to protect the working families of America.</paragraph>
