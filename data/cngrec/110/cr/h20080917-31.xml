    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="171">S. 171</bill> renames a postal facility in Commerce, Oklahoma, in honor of Mickey Mantle, the great American baseball player.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House Oversight Committee received <bill type="s" number="171">S. 171</bill> after it had been considered and passed by our colleagues in the Senate. The measure was originally introduced by Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma back on January 4, 2007, and the Oversight Committee passed the bill by voice vote on June 12, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="171">S. 171</bill> calls for honoring Mickey Mantle by designating the post office in his hometown of Commerce, Oklahoma, as the Mickey Mantle Post Office Building. Mickey Mantle was born on October 20, 1931. Named Mickey by his father after the Philadelphia Athletics Hall of Fame catcher, Mantle is one of the greatest American baseball players of all time. In 1974, he was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, and his uniform number 7 was retired, celebrating his 18 years of playing for the New  York Yankees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in honor of Mickey Mantle, let us pass, without reservation, <bill type="s" number="171">S. 171</bill> and rename the post office facility on Commerce Street in Commerce, Oklahoma, after this legendary American athlete.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of <bill type="s" number="171">S. 171</bill>, to rename the post office in Commerce, Oklahoma, for the town's most famous citizen, Mickey Charles Mantle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mickey Mantle was a true American hero. He was an outfielder for the New York Yankees, a first-ballot Hall of Famer with 536 career home runs. When he hit them, they flew.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He hit the longest home run ever at the old Yankee Stadium--it hit the top facade in right field--and the longest ever at Washington's old Griffith Stadium and at Detroit's old Tiger Stadium. The term "tape-measure home run" was invented when the Yankees' traveling secretary used a tape to measure the Griffith Stadium blast at 565 feet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Named for Mickey Cochrane, another baseball Hall of Famer--Mantle often joked that he was glad his father didn't know Cochrane's real first name was Gordon--the Mick was a three-sport star at Commerce High. A New York Yankees' scout who came to see a teammate play in a semipro game saw Mantle hit titanic home runs from both sides of the plate and tried to sign him on the spot, only to find that he was still 16, still in high school, and ineligible for pro ball. The scout told Mickey he would  return the day he graduated from high school, and he did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four years later the Mick was in right field in Yankee Stadium, and Joe DiMaggio was patrolling center field. Both took off to run down a scorched liner to right field. As they arrived at the ball, DiMaggio called off Mantle. Mantle tried to stop, but caught his cleats in a sprinkler head. He went down "like he was shot," said one observer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In many ways, this blazing fast, preternaturally powerful athlete was never the same. He went on to win a Triple Crown in 1956, claim three American League Most Valuable Player awards, make 16 All-Star teams and win seven world championships. He still holds the records for most home runs, RBIs, runs, walks, extra-base hits and total bases in the World Series.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As great as he was, the question that dogs his legacy is, what if? What if he had stayed healthy? What if he had never contracted osteomyelitis, a crippling bone disease in high school? What if he had never been plagued by other diseases and injuries, including alcoholism?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is number 17 on the list of the greatest 100 players of all time. Where might he have ended up otherwise? Who in baseball history might today be considered above him?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mick was not a great businessman, and many of the ventures he funded with his top salaries for the Yankees proved unsuccessful. But he made another fortune in the memorabilia market. His signature and artifacts fetched sums second only to those of Babe Ruth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why? He moved with a breathtaking grace. He was that rarest of commodities, the fastest and most powerful guy on the team. Moreover, he smiled. He connected with fans. He looked like  he was having fun. Even though he was as far culturally from a New Yorker as he could be, the Yankee faithful embraced him. He later teamed with fellow Oklahoman and Yankee Bobby Murcer to raise money for victims of the Oklahoma City bombing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He led an imperfect life, but he did what he could to redeem himself. He went into treatment and later turned to faith to deal with his increasing infirmities. When he died on August 13, 1995, in Dallas, Bob Costas, the famous sportscaster, gave his eulogy. Costas described him as "a fragile hero to whom we had an emotional attachment so strong and lasting that it defied logic. In his last year of his life, Mickey Mantle, always so hard on himself, finally came to accept and appreciate the distinction  between a role model and a hero. The first, he often was not. The second, he always will be."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California, Representative Baca.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400009" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate Congresswoman Virginia Foxx talking about Mickey Mantle. He was an idol to many of us that played a lot of sports. I know as a young gentleman who was playing during that period of time, I admired Mickey Mantle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only was he a positive role model for myself, in terms of trying to aspire to become a professional baseball player during the time I was in high school, but he was a coal miner, an individual that came from that area in Oklahoma that showed us that with hard work and dedication that you can make it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only hearing the history of his personal life but what he did for a lot of us, because not only did he hit from both sides of the plate, which is very important for many individuals, we saw a switch hitter that could hit a lot from both the left and the right. We saw the competition that he led with Roger Maris during that period of time when they were competing for the home run championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think having a post office named after Mickey Mantle is a great honor for many individuals, especially as we look at many of the Little Leaguers that play in Little League right now that look towards major league ball players who have played in the past who were a positive inspiration to many of us who say that if you can lead, you can be an inspiration to a lot of us. Therefore, I say that we should support this kind of legislation in naming the Mickey Mantle Post Office Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the legislation, which is <bill type="s" number="171">S. 171</bill>, and I compliment Congresswoman Virginia Foxx for carrying on and going through a whole history of his history and background, where he came from.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, all of my family were Yankee fans. My father and uncles and all of the family were strong Yankee fans. They were born and raised in New York City. They were Yankee fans and certainly Mickey Mantle fans. I know they would be pleased to see me presenting this bill on the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I know they also would be upset with me if I did not talk about the problems we are facing in this country related to gas prices because most of my family, as they got older, moved out of New York City and moved out into rural areas, where they didn't have access any longer to mass transit as they had had when they lived in New York City, and depended on having automobiles and having to drive and pay for gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are seeing now in this country is a very big burden on people who live in rural areas such as my district where most of the people are without access to mass transit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to talk a little bit about the failure of the Democrats in charge of this Congress for not doing anything to bring down the price of gasoline. Speaker Pelosi in 2006 promised that the Democrats had a commonsense plan to bring down the price of gasoline. We haven't seen that commonsense plan. The bill that passed yesterday was a sham and an illusion. It was a way to simply give cover to Democrats who are in tough reelection situations. I think it is a real shame. Not only are we  hurting people who live in rural areas, but we are hurting the baseball fans who would like to be able to go to baseball games and be able to celebrate this wonderful game we are talking about when we honor Mickey Mantle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things that was wrong with the bill that passed, there was nothing there to be able to stop all of the legal challenges by radical environmental groups that are blocking or significantly delaying oil leases and production. We now know from having done some investigation that radical environmentalists are challenging every single lease that is being awarded to be able to bring more gas and oil online.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In February 2008, the administration issued 487 leases in the Chukchi Sea sale 193, and every single one of those has been challenged under the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, for 2007-2012, there was a 5-year OCS leasing program, and every single one of those leases has been challenged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are 748 leases in the Chukchi-Beaufort Seas which have been challenged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What Republicans wanted to do, and we had absolutely no opportunity to be able to do so, was to bring amendments to these bills, another promise broken by the Democrats in charge of the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were told when the Democrats took over that we would be in the most open, most bipartisan Congress in the history of the Congress. All bills would be brought through committee, all bills would be allowed to be amended on the floor. So far that has been a hollow promise. The so-called energy bill that was passed yesterday was never brought to committee. It should have been assigned to about eight different committees. It didn't go to a single one. It was brought straight to the floor under  a closed rule and no amendments were allowed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Had we been allowed to offer amendments, one of the things we would have done would have been to offer an amendment that would have allowed for lawsuits to be filed. We don't want to stop the judicial process. However, we think that it should be done in a way that will expedite these leases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We keep hearing from the Democrats that the oil companies have millions of acres under lease that they are not doing. The reason is their good friends, the trial lawyers and the radical environmentalists, are stopping the leases from being exercised by bringing lawsuit after lawsuit after lawsuit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must stop this if we are going to help the American people and bring down the price of gasoline. The Democrats cannot run away from their responsibility of being in charge of the Congress and denying the opportunities that should be presented to the American people to see the price of gasoline come down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So while we are here today honoring Mickey Mantle, honoring the American pastime of baseball, Democrats have to take responsibility for denying people the opportunity to go to their baseball games and do other things they would like to do because they are responsible for the price of gasoline having doubled in the 20 months they have been in charge of the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Yesterday Members of Congress had a clear choice, voting for a plan that sided with American taxpayers and consumers struggling with energy costs or to continue to argue for a plan that sides with the Big Oil companies reaping the largest profits in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, the House, under Democratic leadership, passed the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act. Let me tell you what that plan does. It lowers prices for consumers and protects taxpayers. It expands domestic drilling offshore and on land. It expands renewable sources of energy. It increases our security by freeing America from the grip of foreign oil, and it requires Big Oil to pay back what it owes taxpayers. It ends the subsidies to the oil companies, and it  creates good-paying jobs right here in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The plan that we passed yesterday truly gives the American people an opportunity to have security and to have a brighter future with renewables as part of our energy mix.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to say that I wish that what the gentlewoman had said was true. I wish that the bill that passed yesterday would do something to bring down the price of gasoline. If that were true, it would have had a unanimous vote. Instead, Republicans voted against it and many Democrats voted against it because we know that the bill is going absolutely nowhere. It was simply cover for Democrats who are in tight election races.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a cynical, cynical ploy on behalf of the Democrats, and I am so sorry to see that because I think ultimately people will be held responsible for the cynical ploys that they perpetuate against the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the passage of <bill type="s" number="171">S. 171</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400259" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am new to managing bills on the floor, and I was going to ask if that was the proper procedure, and so thank you for explaining that to us again on the floor. And I know that the gentlewoman in no way, shape, or form meant to imply that I was a liar on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a young girl there weren't too many baseball cards I was actually very interested in collecting. But let me tell you, there were a few. Harmon Killebrew, Tony Oliva, and I knew if I could get a Mickey Mantle card, I could collect the other two.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very honored to be here today to have the opportunity to support <bill type="s" number="171">S. 171</bill>. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members of the House to support this post office renaming of a fabulous athlete, Mickey Mantle of the New York Yankees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum) that the House suspend the rules and pass the Senate bill, <bill type="s" number="171">S. 171</bill>.</chair>
  <narrative>The question was taken.</narrative>
  <chair> In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present.</paragraph>
