  <speaking speaker="412258" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I come to the House floor today to honor our Nation's veterans, particularly the thousands of Hoosiers who have risked their lives to protect our Nation and secure our liberty. All Americans owe a great debt to the veterans who have served and, in some cases, made the ultimate sacrifices for our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Member of Congress, I rely on the spirit of these brave men and women to guide me as we work in the Chamber to ensure our troops have the benefits they have earned and deserved when they come home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This weekend in my hometown of Indianapolis, Indiana, our distinguished House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer has graciously agreed to accompany me to meet with a group of our Nation's finest veterans at the American Legion on Guion Road. This visit will provide Leader Hoyer and me with the opportunity to personally thank some of our veterans and learn more about how we can better meet the needs of these true American heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to welcome the majority leader back to Indianapolis, and I look forward to working with him to ensure that we meet the needs of all of our Nation's veterans.</paragraph>
