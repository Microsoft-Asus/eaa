    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the Senate will be in morning business. During the period of morning business, the first 30 minutes will be controlled by the majority, with Senators LEAHY, MIKULSKI, and KENNEDY each controlling 10 minutes. The next 30 minutes will be controlled by the Republicans. Following that division, the remaining time until 12:30 will be equally divided and controlled between the minority and the majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate will be in recess this Tuesday, today, for a longer period of time than normal, from 12:30 to 3:30. The recess is longer because we have a 2:30 p.m. briefing in room 407 on the National Intelligence report we just received.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the time from 3:30 to 6:30 today also be equally divided and controlled between the majority and minority.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
