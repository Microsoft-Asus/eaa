    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Monday evening begins the Jewish celebration of Passover. Passover is when the Jews remember when they were enslaved in Egypt and Moses led the Jewish people out of bondage and to freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an important holiday, and one in which we remember where we came from and about how good God has been to us and about being enslaved and being in bondage. During this holiday, Jews remember others who have been enslaved and call on Jews to remember and never forget and to try to see that others are not enslaved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Partly for that reason, I introduced some time ago <bill type="h" number="194">H.R. 194</bill> to have our country make an apology for the history of slavery and Jim Crow laws we had in this country. That was an error, that was wrong, and it needs to be apologized for, and a dialogue needs to begin to understand about slavery and its effects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish everybody a happy holiday season and hope we all come together in unity to apologize for slavery.</paragraph>
