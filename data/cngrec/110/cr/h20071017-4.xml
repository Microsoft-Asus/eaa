    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, a couple of years ago, at a time when the House was in session through the weekend, a group of us lonely, forlorn Members during the Christmas season on a Sunday morning ended up in the pews of the Capitol Hill United Methodist Church to be greeted warmly by our guest chaplain today, Rev. Ginger Gaines-Cirelli, and her husband. It was the only time I've heard a sermon in which the phrase, during the Christmas season, "preggers by God" was used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were delighted by her sermon, delighted by her warmth, and she is here with us today. She is a graduate of Southwestern University of Georgetown, Texas, received her master of divinity from Yale Divinity School. She has done church work all of her professional life. Her previous head pastoring job was in Rockville, Maryland. And she has now, for 7 years, with her husband, been the head pastor of the Capitol Hill United Methodist Church. We are very fortunate today to have Rev. Ginger Gaines-Cirelli  as our guest pastor.</paragraph>
