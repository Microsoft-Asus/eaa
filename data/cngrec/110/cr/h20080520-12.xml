    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with tremendous honor that I rise today to celebrate the 60th anniversary of a great democracy and our close friend and important ally, Israel. With its strong technology sector in both renewable energy development and high-tech research, Israel is a natural friend of Silicon Valley, which I proudly represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Israel's contribution to the high-tech industry, from computer processors to cell phones, and its development of life-saving medical techniques, benefit people around the world every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have fond memories of my first trip to Israel, whose people, history, and culture have left an everlasting impression upon me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have supported Israel throughout my career, and will continue to do so. We must continue our democratic partnership with Israel. Once again, Mr.  Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Israel.</paragraph>
