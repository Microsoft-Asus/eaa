  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the House Armed Services Committee will examine the issue of body armor for our troops in combat. Fortunately, before going into recess for Memorial Day, Congress passed a critical war funding bill that will allow the military to purchase body armor and other equipment for our men and women in uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was grateful to visit with our troops during the break in Iraq and Afghanistan. Everywhere we went, the troops thanked us for passing the legislation to provide for their being fully equipped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our soldiers are fighting the terrorists overseas so we do not have to face them again in the streets of America. We are protecting American families in stopping al Qaeda's threat to our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the 63rd anniversary of D-day, we appreciate the new greatest generation. I am pleased Congress passed and President Bush signed a bill that will provide our military with the tools it needs without handcuffing our commanders on the battlefield.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
