  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="Introducing S. 489. A bill to improve efficiency in the Federal Government through the use of green buildings, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="489">S. 489</bill>] Mr. President. I rise to introduce the Green Buildings Act of 2007. This bill is intended to continue the hard work of our former colleague  from Vermont, Senator Jim Jeffords, and would place an emphasis on energy efficient and healthy building environments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the opening weeks of this 110th Congress we have seen a significant focus on the future energy security and environmental health of our Nation and indeed the world. Much attention has been paid to the issue of global climate change and it is my firm belief that not only are the energy and environmental challenges that we face today varied, but that our solutions must be multi-faceted. In order to meet the rising demands of a growing world population and its expanding economies, we need to  address the way we create energy, conserve energy, and preserve the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Green Buildings are structures that are designed and built with energy-efficient and renewable materials to conserve energy and environmental resources. These buildings last longer, use less energy, and promote a healthier environment for those who may work or live in them. Green buildings have reduced electricity, heating, and cooling requirements; use less water; and may even use renewable sources of water and electricity. Recent volatility in energy costs and constraints on the electricity  grid in much of the U.S. have led developers to explore the potential economic benefits of these efficient buildings as well. It is my belief that green buildings will become a significant contributor to America's energy conservation efforts and that is why I am introducing this bill today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposal I offer today is one small step in the right direction and draws upon a bill approved by the Environment and Public Works Committee in 2006. The federal government is already setting an example in energy efficiency under the leadership of the White House and Department of Energy. This bill will take the next step and create an office within the General Services Administration (GSA) to oversee green building initiatives within the Federal Government and provide support for information  to State and local governments as well as the private sector. With almost 9,000 buildings and 340 million square feet of space, the GSA has the experience and expertise to manage this effort for the Federal Government. The Office of Green Buildings at the GSA will be advised by a Green Buildings Council to be comprised of Federal,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While some portions of the private sector have caught on to the many benefits of green or "sustainable design," this bill's establishment of grants through the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) to assist school systems in their school construction efforts will bring these benefits to the places our children spend so much of their time and the facilities that consume a significant amount of energy in our communities. In addition to grants to school systems, the bill would create an indoor  air quality program for Federal buildings, encourage incentives for Federal agencies, and authorize research and demonstration projects in each of the four climatic regions of the United States. The bill is modest in scope, authorizing $50 million over 5 years to begin this most important effort in the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know many of you share in my desire to advance our Nation's conservation agenda. Indeed, many have supported the efforts of our recently retired colleague from Vermont and have your own ideas. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and on the Environment and Public Works Committee as we move this proposal forward. Green Buildings will be a significant part of our country's energy and environmental future and this bill will help us in that effort.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300093" topic="Introducing S. 490. A bill to provide for the return of the Fresnel Lens to the lantern room atop Presque Isle Light Station Lighthouse, Michigan, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="490">S. 490</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lester Nichols Presque Isle Light Station Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Presque Isle Light Station Act requires the return of the historic third order Fresnel lens to the lighthouse in Presque Isle, MI. The lens was removed four years ago for restoration work, but now it is time to replace it and preserve the historic integrity of the beautiful Presque Isle lighthouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michigan has more lighthouses than any other State. Not only are these historic structures symbolic of our maritime heritage, they are the heart of Michigan's coastal communities. Lighthouses are a key part of the tourist economy of many small Michigan towns, and the historic character of our lighthouses brings tourists from all over the country. So it is imperative that we protect, restore, and preserve the Presque Isle lighthouse and all of Michigan's 120 lighthouses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to introduce this legislation with Senator Levin. In the House of Representatives, Congressman Stupak is the sponsor of a companion bill. So the Michigan delegation is united in our resolve to restore the Fresnel lens to the Presque Isle lighthouse for the enjoyment and education of future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I want to say a word about the man for whom we have named this bill: Lester Nichols. Without Les Nichols' dedication we would never have been able to restore Presque Isle's Fresnel lens. Last fall, Les lost his courageous battle against cancer. He was a pillar of his community. He was passionate about the Presque Isle lighthouse and he will be truly missed. Naming this bill for him is the least we can do to show our gratitude for all of his work. And I hope that we will soon be able  to put the Fresnel lens back in the lighthouse and give Les the victory that he so wanted to see.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
