    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the new Democratic leadership that will finally allow the U.S. House of Representatives to address high energy prices. Under prior Republican leadership in the House, the oil industry enjoyed years of record profits, record high gas prices and minimal oversight and price manipulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Curiously, in September and October of 2006, just before the November elections, gas prices dropped an average of $.60 per gallon compared to the record high prices of last summer. This $.60 drop in gas prices occurred despite the fact that there were pipeline disruptions in Alaska and indications that OPEC would cut oil production. Department of Energy's statistics show us that while gas prices dropped an average of $.60 a gallon in September and October, the crude oil price only dropped 10  cents a gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you listened to National Public Radio this week, you would have heard that there is evidence that the oil companies intentionally influence gas price fluctuations, and a $.60 drop was done just before the election to influence the November elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For years, the American Petroleum Institute, the oil companies' main lobbying group, has spent millions of dollars on public relations campaigns to convince the American people that gas prices are a direct result of crude oil prices, not oil company practices. But yet we have a 60 percent drop in gas prices, but only a 10 percent drop in the price of crude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ignoring their own PR, oil companies were able to significantly reduce the gas prices in September and October without a corresponding decrease in their crude oil price. Some consumer advocates, such as the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, have accused oil companies of purposefully reducing gas prices in the months before the election to help Republican candidates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since November, gas prices have already increased an average of 15 cents a gallon. This is not the first time the oil companies have been accused of attempting to manipulate markets for their benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Internal memos from several oil companies written in the 1990s have revealed that the big oil companies have worked to limit refinery capacity here in the United States, allowing these companies to control the supply and cost of gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In May of 2006, the Federal Trade Commission released its report titled Investigation of Gasoline Price Manipulation and Post-Katrina Gasoline Price Increases. In this report, the Federal Trade Commission found that after Hurricane Katrina refiners, wholesalers and retailers charged significantly higher prices that did not result from either increased costs or market friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>FTC Commissioner John Liebowitz, in a statement on the report, acknowledged that, and I quote, "that the behavior of many market participants, on balance, leaves much to be desired."</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Democrats have repeatedly urged the House Republican leadership to protect America's pocketbooks and not that of Big Oil. Nonetheless, the Republican leadership refused to take action last fall on high gas prices. The American people have now chosen a new direction with Democrats in charge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the first 100 legislative hours of this, the 110th Congress, the House of Representatives will consider legislation to end the tax breaks and special subsidies for oil companies. For too long, oil companies have benefited from weak royalty laws, tax breaks and subsidies, at the same time making record profits at the expense of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than helping oil companies' bottom lines, these funds that we will recapture will instead be used to promote alternative energy sources to end our Nation's addiction to oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later this year I look forward to having an open and honest debate on my legislation, which I plan to reintroduce soon, to end gas price gouging.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year over 120 Members cosponsored my legislation to create a Federal law against price gouging for gasoline, natural gas, and other fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to continuing to work towards greater oversight of the oil and gas trading, especially off-market trades known as "over the counter" trades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be re-introducing my legislation, the Prevent Unfair Manipulation of Prices Act, to improve oversight of these trades and strengthen the penalties for traders who attempt to illegally manipulate markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government has a responsibility to protect consumers from high gas prices. I look forward to being able to address high energy prices, to provide our constituents with the protection they need and so desperately deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if I may, I would like to enter into the RECORD a one-page article from National Public Radio about how "in other words, in the run-up to the election, oil companies cut gasoline prices 500 percent more than their raw material costs fell. And it wasn't because refining and distribution costs rose. They were relatively stable. Oil companies simply took less profit from their refineries for a short period of time."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gas-Price Conspiracy? You Bet!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Commentator and consumer advocate Jamie Court says there IS evidence that oil companies intentionally influence gas-price fluctuations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>KAI RYSSDAL: The 110th Congress will be sworn in on Thursday. Speaker-to-be Nancy Pelosi has promised a whirlwind first 100 hours of the session. On the Democrats' list of things to do is cut subsidies to the oil industry. Perhaps as a result, the American Petroleum Institute--that's big oil's main lobbying group--is launching a public relations offensive. Complete with Congressional oil patch tours, and contributions to friendly think tanks. It's trying to convince people rising energy prices  are simply the result of higher demand and shrinking supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Commentator and consumer advocate Jamie Court says that campaign is too slick by half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JAMIE COURT: Say you're an oil executive and you want to keep the Republicans in control of Congress. What can you do prior to an election? Well, you can keep your refineries running at full speed, flood the market with extra fuel, and take less per gallon in profit than usual. And guess what: Department of Energy data suggest that's exactly what the oil companies did this fall. By the second week in October, gasoline prices fell 70 cents from summer's record highs. Refineries were running full  throttle and America's gasoline inventories were up nearly 7 percent from the three previous Octobers. The rise in supply came despite BP's major pipeline disruption in Alaska. Ordinarily, that's an industry excuse to shrink supplies and raise prices. Now, the oil industry claimed pump prices</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, in the run-up to the election, oil companies cut gasoline prices 500 percent more than their raw material cost fell. And it wasn't because refining and distribution costs rose. They're relatively stable. Oil companies simply took less profit from their refineries for a short period of time. Could it have been to influence a political outcome? Well, right after election day, the price of gas suddenly rose after two months of sharp decline. Post-election, refineries have slowed  down, inventories are shrinking, and gas prices are climbing. It's back to business as usual, unless the new Congress starts to do business differently.</paragraph>
