    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an area of exceptional natural beauty in my congressional district. The John U. Lloyd Beach State Park was honored on the national news program Good Morning America as one of the four most unique and scenic parks in the entire country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're lucky in south Florida to have miles of beautiful coastline, but the John U. Lloyd Beach State Park truly stands out. In addition to sandy beaches, the State park features a coral reef ecosystem just 100 yards offshore and a mangrove swamp with a variety of plant species. Wildlife sightings are common for visitors to the park, and few will forget watching sea turtle hatchlings crawl down the beach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to commend the hardworking park rangers who care for our State park, as well as Bob and Barbara Magill, who submitted footage of the beach for national recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the John U. Lloyd Beach State Park is truly a national pleasure, and we are committed to preserving this site for future generations to enjoy. We welcome all Americans to come down and visit.</paragraph>
