    <paragraph>Mr. President, reserving the right to object--it is Friday afternoon. As chairman of the Agriculture Committee, I am seeking to get the agriculture bill done, and Members want to get finished and go home. We only have 1 amendment left on the farm bill, which can be disposed of. We can, I hope, shortly go to final passage on that. If we don't get to the farm bill we could be here for a long time. I say to my friends who are here, we do want to wrap up this farm bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am happy to withdraw my request. I thought it would be a quorum call.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300024" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am prepared to withdraw my request if we are prepared to vote on the farm bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request as made?</chair>
  <chair>Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <chair>The Senator from Alaska is recognized.</chair>
