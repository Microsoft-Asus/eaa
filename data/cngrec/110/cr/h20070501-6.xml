  <speaking speaker="400633" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a distinguished businessman, philanthropist, decorated military officer, fellow West Point graduate and a pillar of our community in northern Kentucky and Cincinnati.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next month Mr. George Schaefer will retire from his position at Fifth Third Bank. Beginning as a management trainee in 1971 after completing his service in the Army, George rose through the ranks at Fifth Third and helped the company to grow into one of the largest financial institutions and bank holding companies in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As George's career grew, so too did his commitment to making the entire Cincinnati metropolitan region a better place to live, work and go to school. He has raised millions of dollars for the United Way and the Cincinnati Fine Arts Fund. For 12 years, he sat on the board of trustees of the University of Cincinnati where he helped the University grow into one of the Nation's premier educational institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>George, while your talents and leadership will surely be missed at Fifth Third, I know that your inspired work in the community will continue. I wish to thank you and your wife Betty Ann for all of your service and wish you the best as you embark on this new chapter in your life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for your service to our Nation in uniform, for answering the Nation's call. Thank you for your contributions to our community. Thank you for pouring yourself into so many aspects to improve the quality of lives for our communities in northern Kentucky and the greater Cincinnati area and every city where Fifth Third is involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are grateful for that commitment, for the example of service and your upholding the values that we both share of duty, honor and country.</paragraph>
