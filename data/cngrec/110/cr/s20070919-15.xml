  <speaking speaker="300050" topic="CAPTAIN SCOTT SHIMP">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to express my sympathy over the loss of United States Army CPT Scott Shimp of Nebraska. Captain Shimp was killed in a military helicopter crash during a training exercise in northeastern Alabama on September 11. He was 28 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Shimp grew up in the small town of Bayard, NE. A 1998 graduate and salutatorian of his class at Bayard High School, he also played football, ran track, sang in the choir, and was an Eagle Scout. It was his lifelong dream to serve his country in the U.S. military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the privilege of nominating Captain Shimp to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. In 2002 he graduated as part of the first post-September 11 class. Captain Shimp served two tours of duty in Iraq and was scheduled to be deployed to Afghanistan in 2009. He was company commander of Company C, 4th Battalion, 101st Aviation Regiment, 159th Combat Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne Division.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are proud of Captain Shimp's service to our country, as well as the thousands of brave Americans serving in the Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our sympathies are with his parents, Curtis and Teri Shimp; his brother Chad; and his sister Misty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring CPT Scott Shimp.</paragraph>
