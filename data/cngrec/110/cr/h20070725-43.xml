  <narrative>WELCOMING THE HONORABLE PAUL C. BROUN TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8466]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. LEWIS of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400240" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as dean of the Georgia delegation, I rise to welcome a new Member to the United States House of Representatives, Dr. Paul Broun.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Broun is one of four men of medicine in the Georgia delegation. He succeeds our friend and late colleague, Dr. Charlie Norwood, who also was a physician.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Broun is a graduate of the University of Georgia in Athens and the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta. He served his country as a United States Marine and as a Medical Officer in the United States Navy. He is married to Niki Bronson Broun. They have two children and two grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Broun comes from a well-known political family in Georgia. His father was a well-respected State senator from Athens for 38 years. I could say, I can say, and I must say, he was a Democrat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Broun of Georgia. A conservative one, at that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of all of the Members of the delegation, I  want to welcome Dr. Paul Broun from the 10th Congressional District of Georgia to the United States House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield to Congressman Jack Kingston, from the First Congressional District of Georgia.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Members of the House, and my friend John Lewis, you are correct. His father was my State senator and John Barrow's State senator for 38 years. He was a very well-respected Democrat. We all liked him a lot. But he sure raised his son the right way. We are glad to have him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all miss and loved Charlie Norwood. You know, in this House, there are creatures of habit. Of course, any time you want to see Mr. Murtha and the Pennsylvania delegation, you go to that corner. Any time you want to see Mr. Young and anybody who wants something out of him from Appropriations, all the Florida Members, you go over to that corner. I think, in Charlie's memory, we will all begin to think that the Georgia delegation will be sitting there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul, we are going to be very happy to have you sitting amongst us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul, John Barrow and I went to the same junior high school. We are very proud to boast about that. He is an avid fly-fisherman. He is a sportsman. He did volunteer work for Safari-International and worked with many of you, got to know Ron Marlene very well and Jo Ann Emerson, among others, and he is ready to go on any codel to Montana or Wyoming that he gets invited to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul is going to be a great Member of the House. He is a hard worker. I think you will like him on both sides of the aisle because he will work for what is best for the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Lewis has already gone over his resume, so I won't repeat it. But I will just say, Paul, welcome to the greatest body the world has ever seen, the United States House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Broun of Georgia. Madam Speaker and colleagues, I am glad to call you colleagues. I am eager to work with you. I am eager to represent the people of the 10th Congressional District of Georgia. It is exciting to me. Just 1 week ago, I was campaigning. Things have been going very quickly ever since then. I am just overwhelmed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with you and working with this great, august body. I appreciate the opportunity. I appreciate the well wishes and all of the host of welcomes that I have gotten from each and every one of you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I appreciate the welcome that you all have given me. I look forward to working with you. Thank you so much. God bless you.</paragraph>
