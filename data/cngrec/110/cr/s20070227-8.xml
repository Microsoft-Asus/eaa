    <paragraph>Mr. President, finally, let me say this. I have had a number of people come to me during the last several days. In fact, I got a call in Nevada. The House is having 2 weeks during the Easter recess. The Senate is going to have 1 week. Everyone should understand that. We are going to work--we cannot move as fast as the House. We have rules here that simply do not allow that. While we would all like to be able to go home and spend time in our respective States, that will not happen. We  are going to have only a 1-week recess for Easter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say during the rest of the year there are no set times. I have been as forewarning as possible to the distinguished Republican leader, telling him of the days we would not have votes, days we would have votes. I am going to do my very best not to have surprises in the schedule. One of the surprises we will not have is 2 weeks for the Easter break. We are going to have to work through that. Up until August, I am hopeful and confident we can get our work done. But the August recess is a  long one, and everyone should understand that is not automatic. We have to get our work done or we may have to shorten that also.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate the clarity the majority leader brought to the issue of the Easter work period. I think that is very helpful to Members on our side of the aisle for planning purposes, and I appreciate his bringing up that matter this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
