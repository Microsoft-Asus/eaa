  <narrative>CONGRESS HAS TO END EMBARGO ON AMERICAN OIL -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2866]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400285" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, recently I met with a number of independent truckers in my district who said that many of their businesses cannot survive the current cost of diesel fuel. And many of my constituents have also said they cannot continue to pay these rising prices of gasoline, the rising prices of food.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What much of this comes down to is: Congress has to end its embargo on American oil. To say we cannot drill in the gulf coast, the Atlantic coast, the  Pacific coast, in the Colorado area with the shale oil, or Alaska, has reached a point where OPEC has continued to grab us by the throat and continues to fund both sides of the war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans understand that whoever controls the supply can demand whatever price they want. And now with gasoline being over 70 percent of the cost of oil, isn't it time that America took control of its own economy and began to use its own resources in an environmentally responsible way?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's end the embargo on American oil. Let's take back control of our economy. Let's take action on this.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
