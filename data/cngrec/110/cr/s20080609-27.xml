  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 87--CONGRATULATING THE REPUBLIC OF LATVIA ON THE 90TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill with my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, commemorating the 90th anniversary of Latvia's independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past century saw more than its share of tragedy, as the twin evils of fascism and communism seeded mankind with misery unknown to earlier generations. Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism did their best to stamp out the individualistic spirit among their adherents, and forge them instead into a single mailed fist suited only for war, plunder, and oppression. Though the struggle against both was long and often dark, rays of light continually pierced the clouds. One such ray was the establishment  of Israel, whose 60th anniversary we are commemorating this year. Another was the independence, sporadic though it began, of independent Baltic republics like Latvia. The modern state of Latvia was born in days of hope after the calamity of the Great War, days when so many of the subjugated peoples of Europe achieved independence. On November 18, 1918, Latvia became free. The U.S. recognized Latvia less than 4 years later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is both Latvia's blessing and its curse to sit on a historical crossroads. The Baltic region has been an important trading hub for hundreds of years, stretching back to the days of Vikings and Byzantium. Latvians, surrounded by powerful neighbors and wealthy trading states, have thus led a perilous existence. Tragically, but not fatally, Latvia's post-1918 existence was to be similarly perilous. Through a secret protocol with the Nazis, the U.S.S.R. occupied Latvia in the beginning of World  War II, and retained control until the final collapse of the Soviet state in 1991. At that moment, ravished by communism and beset by historical injustice, Latvians made a bold choice to build a free, democratic, and prosperous Western-oriented society. They have</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud that Latvia is no longer in peril. It is a valuable member of NATO, and leads a new wave of pro-growth nations in the European Union. I am honored to introduce this resolution with Senator Durbin, and commend Latvia on its 90th anniversary of independence.</paragraph>
