  <speaking speaker="300035" topic="TRIBUTE TO VIRGINIA &quot;GINGER&quot; KIRK">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to special agent Virginia "Ginger" Kirk of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, who is retiring from employment with the Federal Government on October 30, 2007. Special Agent Kirk is retiring after over 24 years of Government service, the last 21 of which have been spent with NCIS. Of special note, during the course of her service with NCIS, she spent a year as a Department of Defense legislative fellow in the office of the late Congresswoman  Tillie Fowler.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the course of Special Agent Kirk's career in Government service, she rose from a GS-3 computer programmer for the Navy to a GS-15 NCIS senior special agent. In her final NCIS job, she was assigned to the Navy's Acquisition Integrity Office--a high-profile, high-impact position that put her on the inside of the Department of the Navy's most significant procurement fraud investigations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Special Agent Kirk's law enforcement career began in the Norfolk fraud unit of the Naval Investigative Service, NIS--the precursor of today's NCIS. In addition to contributing to the collective success of the office there, Special Agent Kirk was singled out to receive the NIS Director's Cup, distinguishing her as the first-ever NIS Special Agent of the Year for fraud investigations. Her early career assignments were particularly fraud-focused and included tours at NAS Oceana, Pearl Harbor, New  York, and Washington, DC. Among other postings, she spent a year with the FBI's Washington Field Office, working on major Government procurement fraud investigations jointly with her Bureau counterparts. That was followed by her first assignment in the counterintelligence arena</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1999, in what she describes as one of the most significant highlights of her career, she was selected to represent NCIS as a DOD legislative fellow on Capitol Hill. She served on the staff of the late Congresswoman Tillie Fowler, where she worked on a variety of defense, judiciary, and other issues. As a result of Special Agent Kirk's presence and persistence, Congresswoman Fowler sponsored legislation that was later incorporated into the Fiscal Year 2001 National Defense Authorization Act  and ultimately resulted in statutory arrest authority being granted to civilian special agents of NCIS--an act of Congress that to this day is considered a watershed event within the agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following her Capitol Hill assignment, Special Agent Kirk was reassigned to the NCIS Counterintelligence Directorate, where she worked on a host of policy issues. Thereafter, she was promoted to supervisory special agent and posted to NCIS's Washington, DC, field office. While her first year there was spent investigating procurement fraud, Special Agent Kirk and the fraud squad refocused their efforts on counterterrorism concerns as a result of the 9/11 attacks and the anthrax threat that plagued  the Nation's Capital at that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2002, Special Agent Kirk transferred to the Pentagon as the NCIS liaison to the Joint Counterintelligence Evaluation Office within the Office of  the Secretary of Defense. She was subsequently assigned to be Assistant Special Agent in Charge for Criminal Investigations at the NCIS Southeast Field Office, located aboard Naval Station Mayport. She concluded her NCIS career back in DC in the Navy's Acquisition Integrity Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, during the course of her Federal service, Special Agent Kirk has made many sacrifices. As noted above, she moved frequently to meet the needs of her agency, the Department of the Navy, and our Nation. She spent extended periods geographically separated from her husband, who was also an NCIS special agent, as each of them strived to meet their own mission demands. She and her husband, retired NCIS special agent Guy Kirk, have bought a home on the side of a mountain in Brevard, NC,  where they plan to take some time together to hike and explore the area. She has also set up a stained glass studio and plans to pursue the artistic side of life. I know all of my colleagues join me in thanking Special Agent Kirk for her many years of dedicated service, and in wishing her "fair winds and following seas" as she and her husband Guy embark on the next chapter of their lives together.</paragraph>
