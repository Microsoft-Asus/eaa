  <speaking speaker="412215" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for over a year now, senior citizens in my State of Minnesota have been subject to a sink hole that the administration calls Medicare part D, the prescription drug program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was really never meant for our seniors. It was written for and by the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies at the expense of our senior citizens and paid for by the American taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, companies like Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Merck and Novartis made record  profits. Meanwhile, Minnesota seniors are at the mercy of complex and confusing drug company rules, matched by the rising cost of drugs, costs that make gas prices seem stable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prescription drugs have increased at twice the rate of inflation. Medicare folks pay as much as 10 times more than vets do through the Department of Veterans Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, that is no way to treat the greatest generation. We can and must do right by them. We must end the drug company charade and enact real prescription drug reform. It is time to let HHS negotiate just like the VA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the House will pass the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act. Let us end the scam and give the greatest generation the dignity they so deserve. Vote "yes" on <bill type="h" number="4">H.R. 4</bill>.</paragraph>
