    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Washington Democrats have once again shown their true colors on FISA. Spurred by the ACLU and their leftist liberal friends, Democrats released a weak and ill-conceived attempt at reforming our national security intelligence laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, advancements in satellite and fiber-optic technologies have led to incredible gains in every area of our society, including health care, economic expansion, education, and military operations. Unfortunately, though, our laws have not advanced and our intelligence community continues to face significant obstacles because of simplistic and antiquated laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake, we live in a time when extremist groups continue to plot acts of terror against us both abroad and here at home. National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell outlined a list of obstacles he faces with the current FISA law and the tools he needs to correct these problems. Sadly, the bill proposed by the Democrats leaves our intelligence community in the dark. This is too important to play political games with foreign intelligence. We need to vote "no" on this bill.</paragraph>
