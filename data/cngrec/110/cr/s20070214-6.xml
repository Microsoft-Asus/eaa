    <paragraph>Madam President, I would like to say that this 110th Congress, when we came here, Democrats and Republicans alike had a real problem because the last Congress only funded the Government until February 15. With cooperation between Democrats and Republicans, difficult negotiations took place, but it was a situation where Senators Cochran and Byrd, who lead us in the Appropriations Committee, working with Chairman Obey on the other side of the Capitol, together  with all ranking members and all chairs of the subcommittees on both sides, worked through these difficult issues. And they were difficult. We had not enough money to do all that is necessary to be done, but we got it done without a single earmark. I know this was difficult.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are issues that are so troubling. There is a Senator on the other side of the aisle, JOHNNY ISAKSON from Georgia. I don't know how you could find a nicer person in the world than JOHNNY ISAKSON. He is pleasant. He always has a smile on his face. He has an issue that is really important to him concerning children and health--something that should be in this bill. It is not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, the senior Senator from Texas, has an issue dealing with BRAC that has bipartisan support. There are bases that we legislated closure for, and communities are having difficult times as a result of these base closures doing all that needs to be done, and we promised them money to allow these closures to go forward without as much concern and real hardship. But there wasn't anything we could do. If we had a single amendment on this bill, it had to go back for conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of that, it would mean that very likely we couldn't complete this by tomorrow night at midnight. I have made commitments to a number of people that we are going to take care of these things in the supplemental which should be here the last week in March, and I am going to do  everything I can to make sure the process on the supplemental is as open and free as people think it should  be. We will be as patient as we can be to work our way through this. I have told the distinguished Republican leader that vehicle will be open to amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think we have done very good work. Legislation is the art of compromise and consensus building, and I appreciate very much the Republicans supporting this. There were some who didn't and I understand that and I understand why. What we did yesterday in invoking cloture on this bill is a step forward to allowing us to get the country's financial affairs in order. I have talked to Senator Byrd. I have spoken to Senator Cochran. I have spoken to the distinguished Republican  leader. We are all going to do our very utmost this year to get appropriations bills done. We are going to be able to do that now that this CR is going to be out of the way either today early on or, if we can't work anything out, when the time expires tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, again, I want to express my appreciation publicly to everyone who worked on this matter. There were people who voted against the bill who were a part of the process of working things out. I have spent time on this issue with the senior Senator from New Mexico. I have spent a lot of time with him. He and I did that Energy and Water Subcommittee for many years as chairman and ranking member. We went back and forth. He didn't get everything he wanted, but he got quite a bit. I am not going to  go through the whole rollcall of others with whom we worked on this to try to make it as easy a slide as possible. But anyway I am glad it is done. It is good for the country.</paragraph>
