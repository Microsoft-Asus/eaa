  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="SERGEANT KEVIN GILBERTSON">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great sorrow, on this day of the 6th Anniversary of the September 11th attacks, that I speak in honor of a fallen American hero. Army Sgt. Kevin Gilbertson died August 31st at the Landstuhl Medical Center in Landstuhl, Germany, after losing a 2-day battle with injuries suffered after insurgents attacked his unit in Ramadi, Iraq. His courage and patriotism will be remembered. My thoughts and prayers go out to his friends and family, especially his parents,  Keeley Peters and Don Gilbertson, as well as his wife, Nina, and sons, Timothy and Nickolas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Gilbertson was an independent, complex, and highly involved individual. He loved his family, he loved his country, and he loved being a U.S. Army soldier. Kevin Gilbertson's service to this country is greatly appreciated, and he will be sorely missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kevin was a native of Cedar Rapids, IA. His father, Don Gilbertson, remembers him as "the greatest kid in the world" who "joined the Army right out of high school to get a college education when he got out ..... His dream was getting a degree and supporting his family." Kevin Gilbertson will always be remembered as someone who gave everything he had for his country and who thought more about others than himself. For that we are eternally grateful.</paragraph>
