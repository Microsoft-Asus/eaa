    <paragraph>Mr. President, prior to the nomination being taken up, let me say that I met General Petraeus in Iraq. At that time, the Republican leader was Senator Frist, who is a doctor, as we all know. General Petraeus said, "I want you to take this back to Dr. Frist and remind him that he saved my life." There was a training exercise going on with live ammunition, and somebody tripped and fell with live ammunition and General Petraeus was shot in the heart. Dr. Frist saved his life. The surgery  was complicated and important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I wish Senator/Dr. Frist were here today to be able to express his appreciation for General Petraeus. I brought that medal back from Iraq to give to Leader Frist and he remembered the surgery. He saved the life of a great man.</paragraph>
