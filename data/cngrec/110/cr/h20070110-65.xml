    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Annie Lee Boggs Latimer was born in Milton County, now a portion of Fulton County in north Georgia on January 10, 1907, to Elizabeth and Ben Boggs 100 years ago today. She grew up on a farm on Boggs Road with eight siblings, Glenn, Mary, Frank, Frances, Walter A., Nettie, Ruth and Dorothy, off what is now I-85 in Gwinnett County, Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She attended Duluth High School, Young Harris College and the University of Georgia and went on to become a beloved teacher in Gwinnett and Cobb counties for over 30 years. On June 12, 1937, she married William B. Latimer, and for over 50 years, they lived in what all knew as the "Rock House" in Duluth, Georgia. Anne and Bill were married for a wonderful 61 years until his passing in 1998.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She is the proud mother of Ben W. Latimer and the mother-in-law of Rachel H. Latimer. She is an inspiration for her two grandsons and their wives, Bill and Lynn and Mike and Laura, and adored by her five great grandchildren Brian, Sara, Claire, Gabrielle and Andrew. She is known affectionately by her family as "Mama Anne" and by her friends at church as "Miss Anne."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She has imparted wisdom and positive values to all the many students who were in her classes and benefitted from her teaching. Mama Anne is a guiding light for all her family and always brings love, direction, caring and support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I know the U.S. House of Representatives joins me in sending our very best on the occasion of her 100th birthday to Anne B. Latimer and recognizing her life as a role model to all for achieving independence, longevity and success, by living the American dream of spirituality, community, hard work, and accomplishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very privileged, Mr. Speaker, to have had the opportunity to recognize one of America's greatest citizens.</paragraph>
