  <narrative>WELL WISHES FOR SENATOR KENNEDY -- (Senate - May 19, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4291">S4291</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I received a call early Saturday morning that Senator Kennedy had taken ill. Since that time, we have heard only encouraging words from his doctors and his family. I spoke to Vicki, his wonderful wife, a couple hours ago. He is resting comfortably. He is having some more tests run today. He is doing very well. Vicki tells me Senator Kennedy is not only up moving around, but over the weekend he was able to watch some movies, but, more importantly, he  was able to watch some Red Sox games. I would note in passing, it cannot hurt his recovery that the Red Sox have won three games in a row.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Anyone who knows Senator Kennedy and his tremendous work ethic realizes no one is more eager to get back to work than Senator Kennedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So to my good friend, the Senator from Massachusetts, I say: Rest and get well. All of your friends and colleagues in the Senate wish you the very best and look forward to your quick return because there is a lot of work we are depending on you to do. We have a number of things, of course, we were working on together last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I talked to him Friday at some length. I am going to give a couple speeches--actually three--on Wednesday because we are having celebrations here in the Capitol on the 100th birthday of Senator, Majority Leader, and President Johnson. It was interesting to hear Senator Kennedy--who had worked with him in all of his capacities, as Senator, majority leader, Vice President, and President--some of the comments he had about President Johnson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we look forward to Ted being back as soon as possible.</paragraph>
