    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with a sad heart that I come to the floor today and honor my good friend Raymond Gerald Murphy. Jerry Murphy died last Friday at the age of 77. A burial with full military honors is planned for Santa Fe National Cemetery this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CPT Jerry Murphy was the 39th U.S. marine to be awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism in the Korean war. He was decorated by President Dwight Eisenhower in a White House ceremony in 1953. In addition to the Medal of Honor, Captain Murphy was also awarded the Silver Star, the Purple Heart, the Korean Service Medal with two bronze stars, the United Nations Service Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal. Jerry Murphy was a hero in every sense of the word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What really made Jerry special though was his service to others. When he returned from Korea, he dedicated his entire life to taking care of other veterans. He spent 23 years working in the Albuquerque VA Regional Office. Upon his retirement, he continued to serve veterans as a volunteer until he became too sick to do so. Earlier this year, Senator Bingaman and I introduced a bill to rename the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Albuquerque, as the "Raymond G. Murphy Department of Veterans  Affairs Medical Center." I am very sad this was not completed before Jerry died, but I hope it will be completed soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to all of Jerry's military honors, he was also a family man. Jerry is survived by his wife Maryann, his sons John, Michael, and Tim, his daughter Eleanor, as well as eight grandchildren. My thoughts and prayers are with the Murphy family this week; I know they are proud of what Jerry accomplished in his lifetime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jerry Murphy was a close friend, and I will miss him greatly. I always valued his friendship and advice. Godspeed, amigo. You touched many lives and helped many people. Your legacy will not soon be forgotten.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish today to commemorate the life of retired Marine Captain Raymond Gerald Murphy. Captain Murphy passed away on April 6, 2007, but left behind a legacy that will not soon be forgotten. His legacy of courage, valor, and commitment to his country will forever remain a part of the history and heart of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Murphy was born and raised in Pueblo, CO. After graduating from Adams State College, he selflessly volunteered for the U.S. Marine Corps and was sent to officer training school. At only 23 years old, 2nd Lieutenant Murphy led a Marine platoon to perform an evacuation mission in the hills of South Korea after U.S. troops had sustained months of heavy mortar attack from enemy forces. Lieutenant Murphy bravely commanded a small group of men up the hill to survey the situation. Met by intense  enemy fire, Lieutenant Murphy pressed on to rescue wounded and killed marines, while continuing to support combat platoons. Realizing that all platoon commanders had been either killed or severely wounded, Murphy found himself in charge of the attack and began reorganizing his men. Murphy ordered his men to carry the wounded back down the hill for medical attention, and carried many men on his own back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having sustained a wound to his left side, and shot through his right hand, Murphy refused medical help until all of his men were brought to safety. Wounded, he continued to go back up the hill, facing continued enemy fire, until every injured and fallen marine was carried back down. As the last man down the hill, Lieutenant Murphy left not a single man on that shattered hillside in South Korea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On October 27, 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower bestowed upon Lieutenant Murphy the Medal of Honor, the highest award for his courage and heroic action during the Korean War. Lieutenant Murphy's Medal of Honor citation reads, "His resolute and inspiring leadership, exceptional fortitude and great personal valor reflect the highest credit upon Second Lieutenant Murphy and enhance the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service." I believe this encapsulates the essence of his service  and patriotism as a U.S. marine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to stand before the Senate today to pay tribute to the life and service of CPT Raymond Murphy. I would like to offer my condolences to his wife Marry Ann and his four children. His family has lost a husband and a father, and this Nation has lost a truly noble man, but may his gallantry and heroism be memorialized forever in the freedoms of this great country.</paragraph>
