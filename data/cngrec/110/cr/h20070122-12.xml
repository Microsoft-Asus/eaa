  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week, I introduced a bill that will make permanent the $10,000 adoption tax credit which is set to expire in 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the father of an adopted son, as a former attorney handling adoptions, and as a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I know firsthand the challenges and rewards adoption brings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The adoption process can be mentally and procedurally exhausting. Families should not be overwhelmed with financial burdens as well. We should offer incentives, not penalties, to those making this commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to sponsor this bill and pleased that 46 of our colleagues, including Ways and Means Committee Chairman CHARLES RANGEL, have joined me as co-sponsors. This legislation is necessary to promote adoption and foster the creation of happy homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
