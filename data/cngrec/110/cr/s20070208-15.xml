  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise on behalf of a colleague and friend, Senator Thad Cochran. Last Tuesday, Thad cast his 10,000th vote here in the Senate, and in typical fashion, we didn't hear a whole lot about it. As Thad once told a reporter:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is just the way I was brought up. I believe you don't have to toot your own horn too much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Always humble, Thad is the perfect embodiment of the southern gentleman, and the Senate is a better and more civil place because of him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thad's political career got off to an early start. As a teenager, he passed out campaign literature with his mom in Utica, MS. He helped his dad with voter registration drives, and a few decades later, he would make Bill and Emma Cochran proud by becoming the first Mississippi Republican in more than a century to win a statewide office--no small feat for a guy whose first job was working as a carhop at Gunn's Dairy Bar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thad was always a standout. An Eagle Scout, he earned varsity letters in football, basketball, baseball, and tennis and was valedictorian of his high school class. He served with distinction in a 2-year tour with the Navy. He excelled in law school and became a partner in one of Mississippi's top law firms in just 2 1/2  years. And he served the people of the Magnolia State with distinction and grace in the U.S. Congress for 35 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thad's colleagues in the Senate have seen his humility up close. The people at the Neshoba County Fair got to see it for themselves a few years back. As Thad's car pulled up, a big crowd gathered around to shake his hand. So when the passenger side door opened, they all rushed in and got a good close look at Thad's personal assistant, Fred Pagen. They didn't expect to see Thad behind the wheel, nor do a lot of other folks who have picked him up at events in  DC and back home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thad gets a lot of special treatment. The Ten Thousandth Vote Club is sort of like the Five Hundredth Home Run Club in baseball. As you might expect, Senator Byrd is the Hank Aaron of the Senate, but Thad might get there yet, and those of us who have had the good pleasure of working with him hope that he does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Winston Churchill once said of an enemy:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has all the virtues I dislike and all the vices I admire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I feel the opposite about my friend, Thad Cochran. He has all the virtues I admire and none of the vices I dislike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I congratulate him on his many years of dedicated service and thank him for his friendship and, above all, his extraordinary example.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, if there were ever a time during my career here in the Senate where I say I associate myself with those remarks, I do now. Thad Cochran is a wonderful man. As the distinguished Republican leader said, he is strong. He doesn't talk very much. He is silent most of the time. He loves the Senate. He is one of the people I look to for maintaining the dignity of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the Appropriations Committee, which I have had the pleasure of serving with him since I came to the Senate, he is as dignified as he is in the Senate and as he is everyplace else. He believes in following regular order. He believes in working through the tedious process the Senate requires. I look forward to working with him this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator McConnell and I have made a commitment, and Senator Cochran knows this, to do our appropriations bills this year. We are going to work together on a bipartisan basis to get those bills completed and Senator Cochran will be an integral part of our being able to do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all have fond memories of Thad Cochran. My personal feeling of warmth relates to a trip we took. I took my wife Landra and he took his lovely wife Rose and we had a wonderful time. Senator Glenn was there leading the delegation. I will always remember that. I will always remember the relationship of the two of you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as we proceed through the difficult days ahead of us in the Senate, everyone within the sound of my voice should understand that one reason we will be able to make it through the troubled waters of the Senate is because of Thad Cochran.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, for allowing me to go next in line so I can speak briefly about my colleague from the State of Mississippi. I thank Senator McConnell for his remarks, and Senator Reid. They did a magnificent job summing up the character of this great Senator from Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Cochran and I have been in the Congress together now for--this is our 35th year. We came together in the House of Representatives in 1973. He moved over to the Senate in 1978. He was elected, and came here in 1979, and eventually I tagged along with him again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Cochran and I go back to the 1960s. We were both students at the same university, the University of Mississippi. His wife Rose and I were in the same class, and we worked together in student activities. I always felt I had a special friendship with Senator Cochran because of my friendship also with his wife Rose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our parents were schoolteachers--both his mother and father and my mother. We both started out as Baptists, and I think we still are, in a way. Just right down the line, we have a lot in common. In fact, some people wonder how I get as many votes as I do in Mississippi. It is because I think some people get confused between Thad and Trent, and I am known in some areas as Thad Lott, but it seems to work. I benefit by standing in the reflection of his great stature in our State  of Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud of my colleague from our State. We have  had some great Senators from our State, but Senator Cochran is rising to the level of the stature of the best of those. So I am very proud of the record he has achieved here, the number of votes he has cast, and I am hoping that he will cast 10,000 more before he decides to leave this great institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I must say on a very personal note, I have never been more proud of my colleague from Mississippi than I was in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and 2006. His quiet, steady, methodical, rational effort to help us get what we needed to recover from that major disaster was an incredible thing to watch. The respect he has in this institution on both sides of the aisle helped him to lead the way in getting the help we needed for our State. I was belated in doing it, but I will never  quit doing it, when last fall  I thanked the Senate--the Congress--for what they did do for us after that hurricane. Everything Senator Cochran and I and others from our State asked the Congress to do, they did it, and we will always be in debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the 1-year anniversary of that cataclysmic event in our State, he and I were sitting on the same platform as the Sun came up in Biloxi, MS, on August 29, 2006--a hot morning. A year earlier, the water had been about--probably 25 feet from where we were sitting. The surge was that high, or more. There were many of us on that platform: mayors, supervisors, Congressmen, the Governor. We were all taking deep bows for all the money we had brought to the people of this devastated area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I had about all I could stand, including taking my own bows, and I finally rose and said: It is fine to share the credit, and there are many of us here who have done our best. But most of us could not be taking credit for what has happened if it were not for the man sitting right behind me on this platform, Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an incredible thing we have experienced in terms of pain and suffering but also in honor and in glory and in appreciation for what has happened since then. So I hope there are many other high-water marks in his great career, but none will ever be appreciated so much as the service he gave to our State and to our country in the aftermath of that hurricane.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, my colleague. It is a pleasure serving with you.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think the Senator from Vermont has to go to a meeting quickly. How much time do you need?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Less than a minute.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield to the Senator for that purpose.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, the most senior person here and, of course, the one who serves the closest with Senator Cochran on the Appropriations Committee. I could not help but think, listening to the wonderful things my distinguished other friend from Mississippi, Senator Lott, was saying about Senator Thad Cochran, about a recent trip overseas we took together, and I heard him saying many of those same things out  of the hearing of Senator Cochran, praising Senator Cochran very much on that trip with myself and other Senators. I mention that because sometimes praising you outside your presence means more than doing it inside your presence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thad Cochran is as close a friend as I have ever had in the Senate. We have traveled together overseas. I have traveled to Mississippi with him. He explained to me I had to slow down my speech a little bit. He has come to Vermont with me. My late parents used to tell me what a nice young man he is. I know how much my mother and father enjoyed meeting him not only in Vermont but in subsequent visits to Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recall what Senator Stennis once said of Senator Cochran: He is a Senator, all in capital letters. You could hear John Stennis's voice boom over here: He is a Senator's Senator. He is a Senator. Most importantly to me, he is my good friend.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from West Virginia.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Senators know of my good nature, and so some of them want me to yield, which I will do. I am the President pro tempore. I wouldn't ask another President pro tempore to do that. But may I yield to my seatmate, Mr. Dodd.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my seatmate and colleague from West Virginia. I just want to add my voice to those who have spoken and those who are about to speak in saying that--just to repeat what Senator Leahy said well--we use the words "Senator's Senator" with some frequency here, but if I were to ask the question of which Senators reflected that expression more so than anyone else, it would have to be my colleague from West Virginia and my colleague from Mississippi. It is  a pleasure to serve with him. I admire him immensely. He is exactly what a Senator ought to be: a good legislator and a good person who cares about his country, and I am proud to serve with him.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I know the Senator from West Virginia wants to make his comments. I wonder if I could just have one moment as well.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Of course. I yield to my friend from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I had the good fortune of meeting Thad Cochran before he was even a Senator. This was when he was wearing the uniform of the U.S. Navy and he was stationed up in the New England area in the late 1950s and early 1960s. I didn't know at that time, when I was about to become a freshman Senator and he was in the service of our military, that our paths would cross again in this wonderful Chamber, or that he would go on to have the kind of career he has had in the  Senate. But it was evident then, so many years ago, that this impressive young naval officer possessed the same qualities we all see today. Then as now, Thad Cochran possessed a deep sense of fairness and compassion, a great commitment to this country we all love, and, above all, good judgment and good humor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thad and I don't always agree on policy matters--and more often than not we find ourselves on the opposite side of the issues--but those disagreements never diminish my respect for his thoughtfulness, and nor do they diminish the friendship I feel toward him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I, too, want to join my colleagues in paying tribute to an extraordinary Senator and a great patriot as he marks this wonderful milestone. The people of Mississippi are fortunate indeed to have him fighting for them every day in the U.S. Senate, and all of us are lucky as well to call Thad Cochran our colleague and friend. He is a Senator of great integrity, and we congratulate you Thad on this extraordinary day.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, last week my friend--my friend--Senator Thad Cochran, the very distinguished member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, achieved a milestone in his career of public service to the people of Mississippi and the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Cochran cast his 10,000th vote, his 10,000th rollcall vote, a record only 27 other Senators have achieved since the founding of this great Republic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Senator's vote is so much more than a number on the final tally. Each and every vote represents an investment of time, research, and analysis on the part of himself and, in many cases, on the part of the staff, also on a given issue. Each vote is an evaluation of what best serves one's constituents, one's State, and one's country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over these many years, I have personally noted that Senator Cochran approaches his responsibility with diligence. I have many reasons to know that. He approaches his votes with diligence, with a fine and keen intelligence, with sterling courage--he is from Mississippi--with courage and compassion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This son of public-spirited and politically aware schoolteachers demonstrated all these qualities at an early age as an Eagle Scout--I was never an Eagle Scout; I was a Tenderfoot--as a valedictorian--I know what that means--class valedictorian, as a varsity athlete--I don't know what that means--as a varsity athlete in four sports. Man, that is something, a varsity athlete in four sports. He is a hard worker--I know what that means--at whatever task to which he applies himself. I can't say much  more than that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Cochran achieved a scintillating academic record at the University of Mississippi School of Law and went on to serve as a naval officer in the Armed Forces of the United States. The discipline and the critical thinking he learned in those venues has served him well during his tenure in the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The senior Senator from Mississippi has been a Member of the Senate since 1978, and 1978 was when I was serving as the Senate majority leader. He served three terms in the House of Representatives prior to that--and so did I, three terms in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout this time, Senator Cochran has paid particularly close attention to the needs of his constituents in Mississippi. That was his duty. Most  recently, after his home State was hit by the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States, the distinguished Senator--a colleague of his has already spoken of that but I mention it here--Senator Cochran used his role as the chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations  to advance legislation that provided over $87 billion--that is "billion;" a billion is one dollar for every minute since Jesus Christ was born--Mr. Cochran provided over $87 billion in supplemental Federal assistance to the States affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A country western artist once asked in song "where would we be without the love of a woman?" "Where would we be without the love of a woman?" Undoubtedly, the love and the support of his wife of over 42 years, Rose--I remember Rose--helped Senator Cochran achieve this great milestone. As I have risen to recognize the Senator, I also wish to salute Rose. She was a beautiful lady, very warm smile, Rose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I congratulate my colleague whose record in this Senate has been that of a true Christian gentleman and a man of genuine political humility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I join my many colleagues today in recognizing this remarkable achievement of my longtime friend, Thad Cochran, who has crossed the threshold of casting 10,000 rollcall votes in the U.S. Senate. In the over 200-year history of the Senate, only 28 Senators have reached this historic milestone. Thad and I both are privileged to be 2 of the 28.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thad and I were first elected to the Senate in 1978, and we are the only remaining Republican Senators of the class. He was sworn in 4 days prior to my taking the oath of office; and, consequently, he is senior to me. I have always dutifully acknowledged that seniority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colleagues have extolled his extraordinary record, and I shall not add further to his wonderful chapter of public service to Mississippi and our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have, however, a most unique, unlike any other Senator, reason to have the highest regard for this wonderful man. For an extensive period in my life, over 20 years, I was a bachelor. There was a tragic loss of a life in our community--Belle Haven--of a man greatly admired and respected by all. I was privileged to have a friendship with this man. Thad helped his family and widow in the wake of that tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There came a time in the years that followed that loss when I said to Thad, you know, this widow is someone I admire greatly, could I be of help, for I am making little or no progress whatsoever in gaining her attention. Being very protective, he allowed he would--in his own good time--try to draw his friend's attention to me. And I am so grateful today to have my extraordinary wife, Jeanne, who as you well know, loves you dearly.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Hear, hear.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>I don't know that I would be standing here today, given my wayward ways in life, had it not been for Thad Cochran and this wonderful lady who cares for me now. So, Thad, I wish you well. What the future holds for both of us remains to be seen. But I am proud to be counted among your most devoted friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As one describes you, I would say you reflect all the qualities a Senator should have--but foremost among them, is always your calm dignity. I yield the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>At the outset, let me say as a rookie in the Senate, I add and echo everything that was said about Senator Cochran. He is truly one to whom all of us who are new to this body should subscribe and hope in time we could equal his accomplishment.</paragraph>
