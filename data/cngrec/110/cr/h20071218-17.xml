    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 11 Nebraska towns for being named "Great Places to Raise Kids for Less" by Business Week Magazine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Anyone who has ever been to Nebraska knows it's a great place to raise a family. Now it looks like others are finding out, and I hope the rest of the Nation takes note.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nebraska boasts 11 of the 50 places in the United States which offer kids and their parents the right combination of safety, community, and education. I am also proud to point out that out of those 11, seven are in Nebraska's Third Congressional District, which I have the honor of representing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So congratulations to the towns of Davenport, Loomis, Diller, Petersburg, Bartlett, Lawrence and Arapahoe for showing the rest of the country how good Nebraska's good life can be.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
