  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, American families are leaving billions of dollars on the table each year by not claiming tax credits that help families pay for child care, to send their children to college, save for retirement, or work their way into the middle class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Taxpayers claimed nearly $83 billion in tax credits in 2004. But families missed out on over $10 billion in unclaimed tax credits, according to a new estimate from the Joint Economic Committee. You can find this report on my Web site at maloney.house.gov.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The IRS can help close this tax credit gap by reporting on the characteristics of households not taking advantage of these credits. This will help us conduct better outreach to families who are missing out on credits that reward their hard work and help them get ahead.</paragraph>
