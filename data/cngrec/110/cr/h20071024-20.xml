    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, as America continues to grapple with the war and citizens throughout these United States deal with their daily struggles, I think it is important for us to harken back to our heritage and to celebrate our culture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the coalfields of southern West Virginia to the Land of Lincoln in Illinois; from the awesome beauty of Niagara Falls to the Muscle Shoals of Alabama; from the hallowed ground of the Virginia Piedmont, where battles were fought to unify this Nation, to the Santa Cruz Valley of New Mexico, this is the fabric of America. This is her heartbeat. Let us take time to listen to it and to celebrate it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation we are considering today was introduced by my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Ohio, Representative Ralph Regula, who has been a strong and effective advocate for heritage areas, not only in the area he represents but also throughout the country, and I commend and salute him for that leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Heritage areas help to preserve and interpret the geological history, the natural history and the human history of an area in a comprehensive fashion so that we and our children will better understand how our land has shaped our history and how our history has shaped our land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National heritage areas are local community-driven preservation projects. Most of them arise out of the concerns of a core group of committed,  local folks who want to work together to preserve the places and resources that make their country or town or region unique. These citizens bring their proposals to their elected representatives in Congress because they need technical and planning assistance from their government and matching funds to use as  seed money to help get their program off the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, 23 years after the first national heritage area was designated, the program is at a crossroads. The Congress can either provide the program with the tools and support it needs to continue, maturing into a successful preservation model, or the Congress can turn our backs on heritage areas and leave local communities to fend for themselves as they try to save those things that make them special, that make America special.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are moving this legislation today because we support national heritage areas and we want to see them succeed. Ever since Congress established the Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor in 1984, heritage tourism has been growing, and today it is a significant economic engine. These areas are worthwhile, not only as a way to help local economies, but also as a crucial tool for preserving our communities' and our people's links to the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By providing Federal recognition and financial support, we encourage preservation and interpretation of important periods in our Nation's history in a way that traditional units of the national park system cannot do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Our initial investment "primes the pump," if you will, and ensures that those areas get a solid start toward financial and operational independence. Given that each Federal dollar is matched by local funds, the Federal investment in the heritage area program is money well spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addressing the Rules Committee Monday, my colleague Mr. Regula noted that the $8 million made in his heritage area has yielded more than $270 million in non-Federal funding. For affected local communities, heritage areas are a program that works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill>, as amended, would establish six new heritage areas, increase the funding authorization for nonexisting areas, and make mostly technical changes in the establishing legislation for several of those areas. The bill also includes a study of the Northern Neck of Virginia, requested by our late colleague, Representative Jo Ann Davis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bringing this bill before the House today responds to the frequent and energetic requests of numerous Members on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats. In total, <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill> includes bills that are cosponsored by dozens of Members in both parties, including the entire House delegation in Illinois and New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also had very helpful input from the administration on this legislation, including detailed studies of the suitability of each new heritage area. Most of the changes being made to existing heritage areas were added at the request of the National Park Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good bill, Mr. Speaker, and I want to commend the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula) for his commitment and leadership on heritage areas. We support passage of <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill> and urge its adoption by the House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am actually saddened to rise today on this particular bill. The 16 heritage areas that are either existing or proposed, many of them are very good, things that I would readily support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, they have been packaged into what the government book my high school students read called "A Christmas Tree" in a very real way, in which bad proposals can be packaged around the few good proposals that are in here in hopes that people will tolerate the bad in hopes of getting a favorable recommendation from the good. My State and most State legislatures would never have tolerated this type of bill. This bill would be split up in our State so that each proposal would stand on  its own merits and go up or down. Unfortunately, we do not use that procedure here. We ought to, but we do not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even in areas where something like an appropriation can be justified by lumping things together, in an authorization, it should not. That is why I rise in opposition to <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When this bill was originally introduced, it was to reauthorize nine heritage areas, giving each an additional $10 million. Since the reauthorization on these nine original areas doesn't lapse until 2012, 5 years hence, it is interesting why we are taking the time now to revisit these particular areas. Even though some of these areas are simple technical corrections and changes, for most it appears that the reason we're doing it again is because they have gone through their money and they want  more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is difficult when the process of a heritage area is supposed to become self-sufficient. It is an affront to heritage areas that are trying to become self-sufficient and break themselves from Federal dependence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1994 when these same nine areas were being discussed, the Democrat hero of heritage areas, the advocate, the chairman of the then subcommittee, the late Bruce Vento stated: "There is a limit to the length of time or the amount of money the Federal Government can be in a heritage area." Not totally grammatical, but you get the point of what he was trying to say.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He went on to say: "In 10 years, we are out of there. Then they are on their own and we get the benefit of that conservation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirteen years later, that has not been the case. In fact, it has been said that for every dollar spent on these heritage areas, there is $10 to $20 from the private sector that comes back. It sounds like a great return on our investment if it could be independently verified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, during the hearings on this bill, the National Park Service testified that no heritage area has become self-sufficient. Unfortunately, it gets worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Heritage Area Alliance, the association which represents all heritage areas, has told us in committee hearing that they should never become self-sufficient and they should always rely on continuous Federal appropriations for every heritage area. In fact, the Heritage Area Alliance has become a cottage industry where groups get grants from the Federal Government to go around telling other people how to get more grants from the Federal Government. And this performance we are now wishing to  reward. While a public-private partnership can yield positive results, this program has taken on a life of its own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Resources Committee, the bill was amended to cut back additional funds to existing heritage areas from $10 million to $5 million. I compliment Chairman Grijalva for his amendment and the chairman of the full committee for accepting it. It is like taking the balls off the bottom branches of the Christmas tree so the cat won't play with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And after taking that positive step, they reverse course and tacked on six new heritage areas. They have had hearings, but in fairness, only one has gone through the regular order that the chairman of the full committee established when we first met this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats also decided to make changes that were never part of the hearing. The new heritage areas will now receive $15 million each, up from the $10 million that they requested. It is great and lucky to receive a 50 percent bonus without asking for it. This gracious move by the Democrats means the total cost of this bill is now $135 million. Some of our committees thought that was a paltry sum. But $135 million is the total annual Federal income tax paid by 33,276 middle-class taxpayers.  And this is how we are being responsible for their particular money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have some problems concerning some of the subtitles included in this new omnibus Christmas tree bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A journey through Hallowed Ground Heritage Area has been diligently sought by my colleague from Virginia (Mr. Wolf). I commend him for his dedication to this cause, and there is much of his proposed area that I like and I applaud. However, one of the problems still is there are issues that still persist. There is both support and opposition within this proposed area. Two of our colleagues have asked their particular congressional districts be removed from this designation. In committee,  an amendment was offered to remove their districts, but it was rejected. And because this is a closed  rule, our colleagues do not have the opportunity of coming down here and on the floor of the House presenting their reasons why they wish to be withdrawn from this particular district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should not take Federal designations lightly. When we create a Federal designation, a Member who is opposed to that should be respected in his particular wishes. We were told this would disrupt the continuity of this heritage area. Well, this heritage area spans four States and it is supposed to still be locally operated. One must ask how a Virginia-based management entity will represent the local interests of four States. It is a legitimate question, but the bottom line is we still should  respect our colleagues' privilege to represent their constituencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been criticism that private property protections in this bill are inadequate. The majority claims that the protections in this bill are sufficient because it states that participation is voluntary. Voluntary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If two of our Members want to voluntarily opt out of this particular bill and are not allowed to do so, how will any property owner sitting in one of these new proposed districts get any kind of confidence that they are safe when it is not voluntary for any Member to remove their districts from these types of recommendations?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Resources Committee, I offered an amendment that would have simply provided for the right of private property owners to withdraw their land from a heritage area boundary. This is the exact same provision that has been on the 12 prior heritage areas. This is the same provision that Mr. Wolf added in his bill and was taken out by the committee even though he objected to the removal of that language from his own particular provision. Why are we treating these heritage areas different  than the precedent we established for the other heritage areas? It is not an additional burden to the management. It would go a long way to assuring constituents that their rights would be protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the amendment was defeated again because the Democrats claim that their language was sufficient, an argument that has proved inaccurate on other occasions. In light of the infamous Kelo decision, we need to be extra cautious in the House when we deliberate on property rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other side will claim that there is no risk to property rights. While I hope that is correct, we need to be very sure because boundaries have a consequence, or why should we have them. Proponents of this bill on the one hand say we need boundaries to protect historical properties, but on the other hand there is no regulatory authority. You can't have it both ways. It is an invitation to lawsuits. We have already seen cases brought forward based on these recommendations. I would point my colleagues  to Pogliani v. United States Corps of Engineers. It has already happened that lawsuits have been filed to discontinue actions based on inclusion in a heritage area. The right to opt out of the boundary we proposed would have prevented this type of situation in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In some respects this legislation is simply not ready for prime time. The Muscle Shoals proposal, which is another one I like a lot, I think it is good, but it has not yet completed a feasibility study. In other words, we don't have the assurance this heritage area could get off the ground before we wish to actually make the check for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were promised in this particular bill that there would be a map included. If you see in the self-executing rule of the Rules Committee, they have put a number in place that used to be blank. A small little detail. But we have not been provided with a map of what the boundaries of this new heritage area actually are. So how can we tell people they can be voluntarily in or out of it when we don't even know yet what the boundary levels are? No wonder this has become a closed rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is another area in this bill that was created, a Niagara Falls region, at the behest of the very powerful chairwoman of the Rules Committee, Ms. Slaughter. Proponents claim it is needed to protect the falls. Protect the falls from what? What potential harm to the falls can be protected by the provisions of this particular bill? Remember, proponents say there are no restrictions or regulations imposed. Perhaps the totally unique commission that is established in this portion of  the bill that has the Secretary of the Interior creating a new entity and staffing it with Federal employees and paying for it can finally answer that particular question. There is little more in this particular provision than using the National Park Service to conduct economic redevelopment projects. The Park Service does not have the expertise, or the funds, or the desire to be burdened with this subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the center of the economic development plan for Niagara Falls is a new casino. Niagara Falls, honeymoons, gambling, there may be a nexus there somewhere for us. But while the State of New York has the right to pursue casinos and help their development, it is inappropriate to use national heritage areas to promote the casino. An amendment was offered when the Niagara Falls heritage bill originally went through the committee to put a firewall between the Federal funds in this bill and the casino.  Committee Democrats rejected again this simple amendment. Whatever my colleagues feel on the issue of gaming is irrelevant. We should all agree, though, that this is not an appropriate use of Federal funds, especially when one area is given an advantage over the other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, concerns have been raised that these heritage areas and their boundaries may be used to impede the placement of energy transmission lines. While this may not be the full intent of the sponsors, we must proceed cautiously before we further damage our ability to keep up with the demand for energy. The grid is already heavily taxed, and it would be a tragedy to see blackouts as an unintended consequence of these designations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, because we do not have an opportunity to improve this bill via amendment as a result of the closed rule, I have to urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, unfortunately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am honored at this point to yield 2 minutes to the gentlelady that the gentleman from Utah has already referenced, the chairlady of our powerful House Rules Committee, the gentlewoman from New York, Representative Louise Slaughter, who has been a true fighter for her Niagara Falls National Heritage Area.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill>, a bill amending the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill reauthorizes already existing national heritage areas. Most important to me and my district, and I think to the country, the bill authorizes the creation of the Niagara Falls Heritage Area. This truly is a monumental day for the city of Niagara Falls, the surrounding communities and the millions of people who visit Niagara Falls each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every time I drive across my congressional district, I am reminded how fortunate I am to represent such a beautiful part of the country. From the shores of Lake Ontario to our vineyards and apple orchards, Mother Nature has bestowed some of her finest treasures upon western New York. But none is as widely recognized at home and around the world as Niagara Falls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every year more than 15 million people travel to Niagara Falls to take in this awe-inspiring natural phenom-&#xD0;enon. It is high time, Mr. Speaker, that the national treasures that are Niagara Falls and the Niagara River be granted the official status they have long deserved, that of a national heritage area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Niagara Falls has always been a source of energy for our region. I don't need to remind you that it is the foremost source of hydroelectric power in North America as well as the birthplace of modern hydroelectric power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will help to solidify Niagara Falls' standing as something more, an engine for the revitalization and promotion of our region's natural, historic and scenic resources to residents and visitors alike. We are not ashamed of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have, obviously, one of the areas of the country most devastated economically. As you know, the heritage area designation ties together private and public lands linked by geography and history. With the approval of this designation, the National Park Service  will assist our local and State organizations to develop and implement a plan to conserve and promote Niagara's natural attributes. Niagara Falls is one of the seven natural wonders of the world.  We should all cherish it. The benefits are obvious for all to see.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 3 minutes to the sponsor of this particular bill, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula), at the conclusion of which it would be very nice if the other side would have additional time for him because he's supporting your side.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Ohio 1 minute, also.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400334" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlemen for yielding time. I could spend all day on this. I've had 10 years of experience with this, with the heritage corridor, and it's been such a tremendous asset.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a matter of fact, our chamber of commerce brought in an expert on economic development as to what we could do to keep young families in our community, and she said your number one asset is the corridor, the trail, because young families want to use it, and they do use it. And putting a human face on it, not only do I see young families all the time out on the towpath with their bicycles, with their family groups, but I see handicapped people who are wheeling their wheelchairs down the trail.  So they, too, can benefit from the value of open space, a touch of environment and touch of nature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a terrific asset in our community. Over 3 million people use it. In terms of costs, this is not an appropriation. This is an authorization. So let's not be confused here by what it costs. That will be a decision for the Appropriations Committee to make as to how much they want to commit. All this bill does is authorize this expenditure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what we found is that we get a huge outpouring of community support, foundations, village councils, private individuals who support this. For every dollar of Federal support, there's probably been $10 of local community involvement because they appreciate the recreational value. They appreciate the family values that come from using these facilities. They appreciate what it means to have this kind of thing in our community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ohio and Erie Canal Towpath, which was originally there as part of the canal system, had brought prosperity to Ohio many years ago. In fact, we had had a system of canals that were the original expressways of yesteryear, and it started with George Washington and John Quincy Adams who pushed this for people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, we all know about the granddaddy of all canals, the C&amp;O Canal. That was saved. It was originally designated to be a highway. The highway folks said, yeah, this is wonderful; we've got 160 miles here of corridor where the canal and the towpath run so we'll put a highway on it. And Justice William O. Douglas got the Washington press corps together and said, "Come with me; we'll hike this piece of history." I suppose that was a little strenuous at the time, but they managed it, and  they wrote such glowing editorials about it that it was preserved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And to date, it's the C&amp;O Canal National Parkway, and all you need to do is go out there on a Sunday afternoon or any weekday and you see people, thousands of people, from the City of Washington and the area using the C&amp;O Canal for recreation, for an understanding of environment, for an understanding of history. It's a terrific asset.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I think what we're saying here is that other communities want to preserve their heritage corridors to tell the story of how their communities were built originally, and this is the case in Ohio. But you get all the additional benefits of health, of walking and bicycling on a towpath, the benefits of being together as a family, the benefits of having a community asset.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was mentioned about the cost, but I don't think we are ready to charge for Yellowstone or Gettysburg. We preserve these things, and it's part of the national responsibility to preserve these historic artifacts and places that are very much a part of our Nation's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would urge my colleagues to support this bill. Let the communities raise their money. Let them go to the Appropriations Committee and get whatever they can by way of support.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill>, legislation to amend the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act to establish six new national heritage areas, including one running through my own congressional district known as the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I believe the establishment of heritage areas provides us with a unique opportunity to take a closer look at some of the most culturally significant areas of our country. As a former school teacher, I believe very strongly in the need to study the past in order to understand how we got to where we are today. Many of the issues that shaped President Lincoln's legacy are still relevant today, and it's worthwhile to continue to explore these issues. The establishment of the Abraham  Lincoln National Heritage Area within this bill would accomplish these goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of creating this national heritage area in Illinois is to manage, study and promote Lincoln-related historical sites. Scattered throughout the central Illinois landscape are countless places where Lincoln traveled and lived. As children, we're taught the basic history of our country, including the basic facts of President Lincoln's life and legacy. What the history books usually don't teach are the experiences and events that shaped President Lincoln and made him the man he became.  By designating this heritage area, we can tie these many Lincoln sites together in order to create a tapestry that will allow us to better understand the influences that shaped President Lincoln's life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During my time in Congress, I've had the unique honor of representing all 11 counties that originally formed Abraham Lincoln's congressional district when he served one term in this very House. The year 2009 represents the 200th anniversary of President Lincoln's birth, and as the cochair of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, which is in charge of celebrating this event, what better way to honor one of the most prominent figures in American history who affected millions of lives than  preserving and studying further those places where he lived and worked and that had a profound effect on his later life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, as it will lead to an opportunity for all in Illinois and all in our country to really have a better understanding of President Lincoln.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400435" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlemen. I want to thank the chairman very much for his help and his support and your staff. I also want to honor Mr. Regula, who has probably made such an impact on these issues over the many, many, many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of this. The journey through hallowed grounds is hallowed growth. It begins with Monticello where Jefferson came out and wrote those words "that all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator." Ronald Reagan said those words were a covenant, a covenant with not only Americans but with the entire world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we move up to Antietam, Antietam where President Lincoln took that win, that battle, that victory there of 20,000 deaths and then had the Emancipation Proclamation. That is hallowed ground because when you walk in 1 day, 20,000 people died.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then we move up to Gettysburg, Gettysburg where President Lincoln, probably the greatest or second greatest President after President Washington, gave that famous speech that made sure the Union came together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is hallowed ground. It is areas that we have helped define ourselves and who we are and why we are who we are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also in this area is Monroe's house, Oak Hill; Montpelier, President Madison; also Zachary Taylor's home; Eisenhower's farm; Teddy Roosevelt's cabin; Kennedy's house; Marshall's house, who helped devise the Marshall Plan. This will help commemorate, preserve and promote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me read you what David McCullough said. He said, "This is the ground of our Founding Fathers. These are the landscapes that speak volumes, small towns, churches, fields, mountains, creeks and rivers with names such as Bull Run and Rappahannock. They are the real thing, and what shame we will bring upon ourselves if we destroy them."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those who have objected, this is what the bill says: nothing in the subtitle alters any duly adopted land use regulation, approved land use plan or other regulatory authority of any Federal, State, tribal or local agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It goes on to say: nothing in this subtitle conveys any land use or other regulatory authority to any local or coordinating entity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the bottom line is, this bill cannot and does not affect the rights of any property owner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, let me say here's what Lincoln said. When Lincoln was in this area he said, "We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have hallowed it far above our poor power to add or detract."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This region, this area is sacred. It is hallow. I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, please pass this bill so we can preserve and protect and promote together, to educate our young people so when they hear the word "Antietam" they understood what took place; when they hear about "Gettysburg" they understood what took place; when they read the Declaration of Independence, they honor the men who said we give our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge an "aye" vote for this and again want to thank Mr. Rahall very, very much and his staff and Mr. Regula for his leadership, not only on this but on all of these park issues and all of these important preservation issues over the many, many years.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of today's legislation, amending the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to applaud Chairman Rahall and his commitment to preserving our Nation's heritage. I would also like to thank Subcommittee Chairman Grijalva and members of the National Parks, Forest and Public Lands Subcommittee for their consideration of this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, I would like to congratulate Mr. Regula for his leadership over many years and offering today's basic underlying bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's been some harsh criticism of this process. My area, the Muscle Shoals National Heritage Area, is one of the six new heritage areas included in this bill. This process has worked the way I would assume a process like this should work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has taken us years to bring our counties together, six counties in the northwest corner of Alabama, the birthplace of Helen Keller, the birthplace of W.C. Handy. There's so much rich history there, but we have not had the opportunity to partner with the private sector to develop a management plan, a feasibility study to come up with a management entity that could further the issues that we want to help preserve for our area. This whole process has allowed us to do that, and I think that's  the way this process should work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Look, we will have the public sector much more involved with us. We have a Helen Keller Festival every year at her birthplace, Ivy Green. Her home has deteriorated. It is an embarrassment to the country. It's an embarrassment to our area how much it's deteriorated. But now the public and private sector are coming together to preserve that homeplace and to make sure that the festival that honors her heritage there is one that's carried on in surroundings that it should be carried on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said earlier about the process, a woman there, Nancy Gonce, teamed with the University of Alabama and brought together resources from all over that section of Alabama to make sure that we had the chance to have this national heritage area determined there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate this process and urge the passage of this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you very much for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill> and urge my colleagues to vote "no" on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Journey Through Hallowed Ground is not Mr. Wolf's bill. It is a  Democrat substitute bill that has been added to a larger bill, <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill>, that is also a Democrat substitute bill. <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill> reflects a big government, big spending philosophy that tramples over taxpayers' interests and private property rights established and considered fundamental by revered American leaders such as Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln. What's more, it is  being brought up under a closed rule. An amendment I offered to ensure majority voting control by congressional district residents over decisions by management entities affecting sites in their district located within heritage areas was rejected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was an enthusiastic supporter of the establishment of the Journey Through Hallowed Ground when it was perceived as a collective marketing effort. I thought, gee, what a great idea to include in one marketing effort all these grand historic sites in these four States, many of which are in the district I have the honor of representing. The Battle of Monocacy, the Battle of South Mountain, the Battle of Antietam, the C&amp;O Canal that was mentioned by my friend, Mr. Regula, are all in my  district. What a grand name for it, the Journey Through Hallowed Ground. In fact, this was such a great idea, it was such a fantastic name, that I was a little embarrassed when I thought to myself, gee, Roscoe, why didn't you think of that, such a great idea. Then, regrettably, it has metamorphosed</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have consistently stated and testified on both September 28, 2006, and March 8, 2007, that any Federal legislation to create the Journey Through Hallowed Ground Heritage Area should retain local control of its management by Marylanders concerning sites in Maryland. I also believe that if the value of land is reduced as a result of actions by the management entity, or local zoning ordinances, for instance, then affected property owners should be compensated at fair market value. I don't only  think this, this is a requirement of the fifth amendment of the Constitution. We have taken value from their land, and we need to compensate them for that. We almost never, ever do that. If the fifth amendment of the Constitution were, in fact, honored, most of the governments would be bankrupt because they couldn't pay for the value they had taken from their taxpayers' lands. It is unwarranted to spend $15 million of taxpayers' money to protect and promote the Journey Through Hallowed Ground. This is such a great idea. There is plenty of money out there in the private</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just quote a couple of things from some outside groups that have looked at this. First from Americans for Tax Reform/Property Rights Alliance Vote Alert: "We urge all Members to side with Americans and protect the right of land use by voting 'no' on <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill>."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the National Taxpayers Union: "NTU urges all Members to vote `no' on <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill>. NTU testified against <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill> in committee, and we're dismayed to see that the bill has grown in both cost and potential harm since introduction. Rollcall votes on <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill> will be significantly weighted in our annual Rating of Congress."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the Heritage Foundation, in a report that they issued called "National Heritage Areas: Costly Economic Development Schemes that Threaten Property Rights, Backgrounder 2080:"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"In fact, non-National Park Service funds amount to nearly 70 percent of the costs associated with the national heritage areas. If this pattern continues, <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill> would lead to an additional $270 million in NHA spending by Federal, State, local and not-for-profit entities."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"One of the most controversial aspects of <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill> is the establishment of the Journey Through Hallowed Ground," which is in my district. "The effort is sponsored and promoted by mainly two factions, Virginia-based environmental groups with a long history of opposition to most residential and commercial development in the region and wealthy estate owners who would benefit from the cachet and exclusivity that the designation might bring. The opposition includes local property owners and a  large majority in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Other NHAs have used their federally acquired authority to impose restrictive zoning requirements on the region's property owners to limit development and/or to force it into directions agreeable to those who guide the management of the NHA."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me review. Members may be concerned that <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill> would, one, increase Federal funding by 50 percent from $10 million to $15 million per national heritage area, an amount neither requested nor reviewed in hearings, with total additional Federal spending of $135 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two, it would expand the boundaries of three existing national heritage areas and, in addition, it would create six new national heritage areas, including the Journey Through Hallowed Ground, at a total initial authorization of $90 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would reauthorize, increase and extend Federal funding for nine existing national heritage areas through 2012 at an additional cost of $45 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of our Nation's founders knew of the intimate connection between personal liberty, taxpayers' interests and property rights. <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill> tramples over, rather than honors, these hallowed principles.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill>, but I will address my specific comments to subtitle D of title II which authorizes the Freedom's Way National Heritage Area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New England provided four of our original 13 States and has been long associated with our Nation's formative years, our major social and intellectual movements and, of course, great natural beauty. The area that comprises the proposed Freedom's Way National Heritage Area, which is included in this bill, has provided the backdrop for many other events and movements that shaped America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Freedom's Way includes 37 communities in Massachusetts and eight in New Hampshire that are historically rich. Freedom's Way chronicles and celebrates the Revolutionary War stories of Lexington and Concord. Additionally, the free religious expression and social movements of the Shakers and Transcendentalists had their roots in the region. The area also hosted the social justice and the social criticism development found in the writings of Emerson, Hawthorne, Alcott, Fuller and Thoreau. And finally,  the movements for the abolition of slavery, women's rights and environmental conservation all have roots within the boundary of Freedom's Way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposed initiative embodies the National Park Service's criteria for national heritage areas. It will conserve historic, cultural, scenic and natural resources for the benefit of current and future generations. The idea has received widespread support from local residents and has the support from every Member of the House whose district includes a portion of the proposed area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this designation, the communities included will benefit from better resources to create a cohesive learning experience, using the natural setting and historical and cultural artifacts to tell the story of American democracy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I submit for the Record a letter signed by 110 organizations interested in property rights who are opposed to this particular bill, including such groups as the Taxpayers Union, a supervisor in the affected area, Property Rights Foundation of America, Family Research Council and a mayor in my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coalition Letter Detailing Risks of National Heritage Area Designation</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The following letter--signed by a diverse group of more than 110 organizations, elected officials and citizens--was delivered on September 4 to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader John Boehner, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Pete V. Domenici, House Committee on Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick Rahall,  House Committee on Natural Resources Ranking Member Don Young as well as all the members of the House and Senate Natural Resources Committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear [Elected Official]: The U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Kelo v. City of New London ignited a national outcry against government abuse of property rights. The "bridge to nowhere" and other wasteful programs triggered angry protests against the practice of earmarking National heritage areas are the Kelo decision and earmarks rolled into one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National heritage areas are preservation zones where land use and property rights can be restricted. They give the National Park Service and preservation interest groups (many with histories of hostility toward property rights) substantial influence by giving them the authority to create land use "management plans" and then the authority to disburse federal money to local governments to promote their plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a March 2004 General Accountability Office report on heritage areas states: "[National heritage areas] encourage local governments to implement land use policies that are consistent with the heritage areas' plans, which may allow the heritage areas to indirectly influence zoning and land use planning in ways that could restrict owners' use of their property."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposed "Journey Through Hallowed Ground National Heritage Area Act" provides a good case study on how heritage areas can be self-perpetuating federal pork and influence projects. The chief lobbying organization for this heritage area, the Journey Through Hallowed Ground Partnership, received a one million-dollar earmark in the 2005 federal transportation bill at the behest of Members of Congress sponsoring legislation to establish this heritage area--an earmark that was granted before  the organization was even incorporated. A million-dollar earmark thus was issued to help create a steady stream of future pork, at the expense of the rights of local landowners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe zoning and land use policies are best left to local officials, who are directly accountable to the citizens they represent. National heritage areas corrupt the principle of representative government and this inherently local function by giving unelected, unaccountable special interests the authority to develop land management plans and federal money with which to finance their efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once established, National heritage areas become permanent units of the National Park Service, and as such, permanent drains on an agency that currently suffers a multibillion-dollar maintenance crisis. According to the GAG, "sunset provisions have not been effective in limiting federal funding [for National Heritage Areas]: since 1984, five areas that reached their sunset dates received funding reauthorization from the Congress."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Supporters of new heritage areas have the public will precisely backward: Americans want stronger property rights protections and less pork-barrel spending--not more earmarks to programs that harm property rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please do not support the creation of additional national heritage areas or federal funding for heritage area management entities, support groups, or groups that lobby for or advocate the creation of new heritage areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, with the development of such strong bipartisan legislation of this nature, it obviously takes a lot of work by Members' staffs on both sides of the aisle and by members of the originating committee, our Committee on Natural Resources, as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Raul Grijalva, one of those gentlemen that has taken the reins of leadership this year as chairman of our Parks Subcommittee and done a tremendous job.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400162" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me thank the chairman for the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here to support <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill> as chairman of the subcommittee, but also supporting the larger heritage area bill. One section in particular that applies to my community is the designation of a new heritage area in the Santa Cruz Valley of Arizona.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Santa Cruz Valley has national significance and deserves the recognition that this designation would bring and highlight what is a shared border with Mexico. The Santa Cruz Valley encompasses many diverse cultures and histories. These include native peoples whose heritage dates back 13,000 years, and the descendants of Spanish, Mexican and American territorial settlers who shaped the region, its land, its customs and its traditions from the 1690s to the present date.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For me it's an important designation. I grew up on a ranch, Canoa Ranch, that is located within the Santa Cruz Valley. It's a historic ranch, been designated as such and presently is being renovated to bring and highlight what that ranch life was in the 1800s and 1900s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The towns and cities of the Santa Cruz Valley support this. The amount of support that this proposal has is truly outstanding. I want to say something not only about the Santa Cruz Valley and its importance, but I think it transcends the discussion that we are having about heritage areas. Heritage areas, through the designation, is also a recognition of a mosaic, a mosaic of history, people, traditions, the environment, a mosaic that shapes this country. Each one is as different and diverse as  our Nation. To get to a designation point takes a great deal of work and cooperation among communities and peoples, and that's what we are acknowledging with heritage areas, the work that went into it, the diversity of this great Nation of ours, and the mosaic that makes this Nation of ours as special and privileged as it is in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to say that we are going to hear things about taking property rights, the cost. A GAO study was commissioned, and many of the organizations which have been submitted for the record as private property rights advocates were solicited to provide specific examples where heritage areas did indeed interfere with, take or prohibit the use of someone's private property. Not one instance came up in that study. I just want to reaffirm that these projects, these heritage areas are cooperative,  bipartisan and truly deserving of the designations. I want to thank the chairman for the entire bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the GAO report that was just referenced, it is one of those unique things, not wishing to actually criticize the Federal Government for what they do, but in the entire report, not one property owner was interviewed, not a single property attorney was interviewed, nor a Realtor, nor appraiser, nor a local zoning official. Simply put, the report neglected to ask those who actually know what the impact of a heritage area has on the property rights and values of their  land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from California, Mr. SAM FARR.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400129" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's a pleasure to rise as a former member of this committee and to congratulate the chairman and the ranking member and the fellow committee members for bringing this bill to the floor. Much of the committee work in the past, I think, was focused a lot on the Federal lands in the West. This bill, interestingly enough, focuses on land mostly east of the Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressional authorization is essential to sound management of these important places. But this just isn't about land designation; it's about the beauty and heritage of American spirit, our cultural spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As cochair of the House Tourism Caucus, we have learned that we need to increase travel in this country, particularly outreaching to foreign visitors, because the image of the United States around the world is not that good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, visitors coming to this country, seeing this beautiful land, and meeting the people in this country, and looking at our history and our beauty of what I think is the best culture in the world, the American spirit, can only be done by showing them places that we have preserved, so that it's just not all sort of sprawled-out urbanism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These special places need to be protected, because they need the guidance of a good government structure like the Federal Government along and in partnership with State and local government. I want to associate myself with the words of the other speakers that have long been involved in land-use planning and land use, and there has never been an eminent domain or taking of this land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In fact, the prices, if they do buy them, are agreed upon by the landowner, and they're agreed upon without having to have any disputes. So I think it's worked very, very well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America is a beautiful place, but it's beauty is not just in its scenery. It's also in its people and the people's heritage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to authorize the celebration of America's great assets, this bill, the heritage of our people.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield an additional 2 minutes to the sponsor of this particular bill, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. REGULA asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400334" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to commend Chairman Rahall and the staff for their effective working on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a people's bill because what it does is allows the local communities to develop their heritage legacy. As Mr. Wolf pointed out, the historic corridors, as was pointed out also by Mr. LaHood, would bring these things to life. It would bring these battlefields to life to understand what happened there and how important that is to our Nation's heritage as a people, how important it is in the case of Lincoln, as to what his life has meant to all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it's no encroachment on local control. In fact, it's the epitome of local control, because the decision to make heritage corridors work is up to the people. In our own experience, as I say, we've raised over 250 million private dollars to match something like 8 or 9 million of Federal dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But putting the Federal imprimatur on this gives it a certain status that allows foundations, that allows private individuals to contribute to making these corridors a success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as I said earlier, it enhances family values. It enhances property values. It enhances understanding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'll never forget going out, to our corridor, where we had a group of students from the inner city as part of a summer work program, cleaning up the right-of-way where we now have the towpath. And these two young students who for the first time in their life, saw a turtle. It was a whole new experience for them. I said to them, Keep your finger out of that turtle's mouth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it illustrates how historic corridors are so much a part of everyone's heritage, to understand environmental values, to understand historical values, to understand what has made this Nation great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. This is a gift to the people of all local communities that have a corridor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, as I understand I have the right to close.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Do I understand you have no more speakers?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="">
    <paragraph>That's correct. And I reserve the right to close.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Then I'm prepared to close as well, if that's okay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as I said at the very beginning of this particular debate, on this particular bill there are elements of this bill that I fully support and I think are wise, good moves forward. There are some things in there that simply are not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have talked a lot and heard a lot about some of the better parts of this bill. However, we're talking about heritage areas. And I'm sorry, in all due respect, a casino as a heritage area for Niagara Falls? Those are some of the stretches that we have in this particular element.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we had our committee hearing, there were several people that were talking about the need for these new heritage areas. One particular individual who was testifying told of the importance of having this Federal designation, so I tried to zero in on that and ask what it is specifically about this designation that cannot be done by the local levels, by State government, the local entity. Give me one thing that cannot be done that only the Federal Government can do. There was not one element  that was given until somebody behind him simply answered that the correct answer is there are 15 million reasons why you have this designation, and each one has a portrait of George Washington on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have all been lobbied on this bill, even though lobbying is not allowed in this bill. We have tried to put amendments and provisions of these parts that would clarify, clarify that lobbying could not be used by this Federal money going to these entities, and yet the chairman's argument against this, well, it would be making it too difficult for heritage areas to then ask for money. Had we not had a closed rule, some commonsense changes as, for example, where the map actually is, should there  be lobbying allowed, should there be real protection for private property owners, should we actually define what these are, they would have been allowed to be discussed and at least voted on this particular bill. Unfortunately, the Rules Committee cut out that opportunity, and now we're here with a closed bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of my colleagues who do not serve on the Resources Committee may not be aware that the Department does not support these bills. On each and every heritage area that we've had recommended to the committee, the Department has asked the committee to defer action until a criteria for heritage areas is established. And I can see why some deferment makes sense. Perhaps we wouldn't be here debating heritage areas that have not yet finished their feasibility studies or had their maps prepared had  we listened to that advice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of good things, but this is still a classic Christmas tree with a lot of bad things that are hidden by the good ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues not to support this omnibus lands bill, this Christmas tree of lands bill, simply because there are too many bad things that need to be fixed before it moves on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in summation, these are not good times for the ratings of the United States Congress in the public opinion polls. We all know that in this body; yet I think if the American people would see Congress in action this very moment that those poll ratings might very well go up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've seen examples on this legislation of Members on both sides of the aisle in a bipartisan, nonpartisan manner, working to preserve what is the best of America. I look at the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula), I look at the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf), I look at the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood) on the other side of the aisle, and I look at the many Members on this side of the aisle from different parts of the country, south, north, west, that have joined  together in bringing this legislation to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, we have respectful disagreements, and I respect the gentleman from Utah's position, but we also have worked very hard in what I think the American people want to see, and that is a nonpartisan effort to solve this country's problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if you looked up the word "red herring" in Webster's Dictionary, the definition would be the property rights arguments that the critics of this bill are using against this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Heritage areas have no regulatory authority. Over 60 million Americans live in heritage areas. The entire State of Tennessee, for example, the entire State of Tennessee is a heritage area. Almost my entire congressional district is a heritage area. There have been no impacts on private property rights, mining, road building, economic development. I believe we've done quite well in each of those areas in my congressional district, most of which is a heritage area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the gentleman from Arizona, the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Grijalva, brought out very well where we've seen no instances where there have been private property issues, no instances where such problems have occurred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, those that have expressed concern about property provisions in this bill, let me be clear. In the 20 years plus of this program's existence, opponents have not been able to identify one single instance in which someone has been deprived of the use of their property as a result of such designations as we're considering in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And nevertheless, as the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) has quoted, we do, in this legislation, provide extensive property, private property provisions. These private property protections are the same language approved by the Senate, the same language proposed by the administration in heritage area systems bills under consideration in this Congress, and the same language included in heritage areas bills passed by the previous Congress under the other party's control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The history of this program, as we have seen in repeated debate on the floor and in committee, not to mention the GAO report which has been referenced, has proven that there are simply no legitimate private property issues here. It's time to move on, stop flogging this dead horse and bringing up this red herring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the gentleman from Utah mentioned our late colleague, the gentleman that was elected to Congress with me, the late Representative Bruce Vento, the former chairman of the Parks Subcommittee. And the gentleman from Utah mentioned that he did not intend for the Federal heritage areas to last longer than 10 years. I'm reasonably sure, however, that our late colleague did not foresee these areas having to contend with close to $90 a barrel oil and the other increase in costs, I might add, that  the numerous heritage areas created under Republican Congresses that were all authorized for 15 years. We have provided an increase in authorized funding for heritage areas to ensure that heritage areas have enough funds to get on their feet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the issue here is not private property rights. The issue is not gaming in these areas. The issue is not earmarks. I would say to my colleagues, imagine, for example, if Yellowstone National Park did not exist and Members of Congress introduced legislation to provide for such a crown jewel of our national park system. Would that be called an earmark?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The issue is not lobbying by local people, our local legislators. They have a right to try to secure that additional State and local funding necessary to match Federal funding. We provide  protections. Federal law prohibits any other lobbying by local groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the issue, as I conclude, Mr. Speaker, is not about earmarking, not about lobbying, not about private property rights; it's about the American people and protection of what is theirs and providing our American people a place in which they can take their families, can spend quality time of life in these times when it's so hard to spend quantity time together, that they spend quality time together. And that's what we're talking about in this legislation. That's what we're talking about in our  heritage areas, in America's heritage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I conclude by urging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue the nonpartisan, bipartisan spirit that has brought this bill to the floor and pass this legislation by a tremendous margin.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill>, the Celebrating America's Heritage Act. As an original co-sponsor of this important legislation, I fully support the reauthorization of the National Heritage Areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am especially pleased that this bill authorizes additional funding for Silos and Smokestacks National Heritage Area in Iowa, and also pleased that the bill establishes six new Heritage Areas, because they have so much to offer. My District, the 1st District of Iowa, is home to Silos and Smokestacks, one of the 37 current federally designated heritage areas in the Nation. Silos and Smokestacks covers 20,000 square miles, and 37 counties in Iowa, and preserves and tells the story of Iowa and  American agriculture, both past and present. Silos and Smokestacks also helps convey the global significance of Iowa and American agriculture through partnerships and activities that celebrate and honor the land, people, and communities of the area. Agriculture in Iowa is as crucial as it ever was, but has evolved significantly. Through museums, farms, schools,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill>, which includes legislation to extend the authorization of the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route. I would first like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues in the New Jersey delegation for their continued support of this extension. I would also like to thank Chairman RAHALL, Ranking Member YOUNG and their staff for their support and guidance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Established by Congress in 1988, the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail incorporates the very best of what the great State of New Jersey has to offer to the rest of the Nation. The Trail unifies New Jersey's many scenic points of interest. These points of interest include a wealth of environmental, historic, maritime and recreational sights found along New Jersey's coastline, stretching 300 miles from Perth Amboy in the north, Cape May in the extreme southern tip of the State and Deepwater to  the west.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Trail's area includes three National Wildlife Refuges, four tributaries of a Wild and Scenic River system, a Civil War fort and National cemetery, several lighthouses, historic homes, and other sites tied to southern New Jersey's maritime history. Through a network of themes and destinations, the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail connects people with places of historic, recreational, environmental and maritime interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One exciting aspect of the Trail is its focus on maritime history. There is a rich story to be told about the industries once sustained by the Delaware Bay, such as whaling, shipbuilding, crabbing and the harvesting of oysters. While we often define our Nation's history through military or political milestones, the Trail will serve to remind visitors that maritime-dependent commerce was a major factor in the growth of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Eco-tourism" along the Trail has proven to be a huge success. There is an abundant variety of natural habitats and species to be found on the Trail. Whale and dolphin watching have become extremely popular, and bird lovers from throughout the country, and in fact around the world, are realizing what Southern New Jersey residents have known all along: our region is unmatched for observing migratory birds, ospreys and bald eagles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Trail has also helped to foster important partnerships between the Federal government and individuals, groups, corporations, State and local governments. Since the Trail began, these partnerships have resulted in additional funding amounting to almost double the investment of the Federal government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Legislation reauthorizing the Trail was included in <bill type="s" number="203">S. 203</bill>, the National Heritage Areas Act of 2006, which the President signed into law in October of 2006. <bill type="s" number="203">S. 203</bill> requires a strategic plan for the Trail to be prepared "Not later than 3 years after the date on which funds are made available." Unfortunately, under <bill type="s" number="203">S. 203</bill>, the Trail is only reauthorized through September 30, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language pertaining to the Trail included in <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill> has the support of the entire New Jersey Congressional delegation. It would extend the authorization of the Coastal Heritage Trail Route in New Jersey until September 30, 2011. This would allow for adequate time to complete the required strategic plan, which will explore opportunities to increase participation by private and public interests, as well as organizational options for sustaining the Trail. <bill type="s" number="1039">S. 1039</bill>, a bill containing language  very similar to the Trail language in <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill>, was introduced in the Senate in March.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its inception, the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail has not only helped New Jersey residents develop pride, awareness, experience with, and understanding of our coastal resources and their history, it has encouraged visitors to explore this area, bringing with them much needed tourism dollars. The extension of the authorization contained in <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill> will allow the Trail to continue and flourish. I urge my colleagues in the House to support this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400440" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have several concerns with <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill>. While I may support several subtitles within this bill, changes have been made that harm the positive intent of the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An unexpected and unrequested increase, from $10 million to $15 million, in the authorization for new Heritage Areas was inserted by the Majority. No hearings have been held to discuss this change and we do not understand why it is warranted. The cost of this bill has ballooned to over $135 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have further reservations because the closed rule does not provide two Members of the House the opportunity to adequately represent their districts. Mr. BARTLETT and Mr. GOODE have expressed concerns that they do not want to be included in these Heritage Areas and would prefer to be removed. I believe a Member has the right to represent his district and decide which Federal designations will be created over his constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee has heard concerns that this bill would exacerbate the problem of Heritage Areas and their inability to operate without Federal funds. Heritage Areas are supposed to become self-sufficient: they were designed with that goal and that intent. This simply delivers more money to those heritage areas that have run through their authorization. The National Park Service testified that no National Heritage Area has succeeded in becoming self-sufficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen evidence that the National Park Service and some Heritage Areas are violating public law by using Federal funds for lobbying. They go so far as to instruct other groups on how to start new Heritage Areas and further this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In committee we sought to strengthen the private property rights protections. My Democrat colleagues believe this is the cure to a problem that does not exist. I urge them to reconsider and adopt real property protections that allow owners to withdraw from Heritage Area boundaries. This protection has been given to the last twelve Heritage Areas and should not be denied any new Heritage Areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the committee has learned that Heritage Area boundaries may be used to impede the placement of critical energy transmission lines. At a time when the national grid is already heavily taxed and the threat of blackouts loom, we should not build obstacles to providing Americans with reliable energy.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412225" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill>, Celebrating America's Act of 2007, to amend the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 to extend authorizations of certain natural heritage areas, including the Blue Ridge Natural Heritage Area, and for other purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mission of the Blue Ridge National Heritage Area is to protect, preserve, interpret, and develop the unique natural, historical, and cultural resources of western North Carolina for the benefit of present and future generations, and in so doing to stimulate improved economic opportunity in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill extends authorization of the existing Blue Ridge National Heritage Area, a landscape full of superlatives: the highest mountain, Mount Mitchell; deepest gorge, Linville Gorge; and highest waterfall, Whitewater Falls in the eastern United States; the oldest river in North America, the New River; and the two most visited National Park lands in the country, the Blue Ridge Parkway and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The region is home to the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians  who continue to preserve many facets of traditional Cherokee culture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am especially pleased that this legislation extends and increases authorization of funds for the Blue Ridge National Heritage Area and  others, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation and support enhancing our natural and cultural heritage for future generations.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to comment on one aspect of <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill>: the effect of the designation of National Heritage Areas on the development and siting of needed energy infrastructure. Some of these National Heritage Areas fall within National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors that were recently designated by the Department of Energy. Development and siting of new electric transmission was an important part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and the designation of National  Interest Electric Transmission Corridors is a critical component in getting that new transmission built.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Originally, there was concern that the designation of National Heritage Areas could impede the development of new energy infrastructure, even if that infrastructure were in a National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor. Bipartisan compromise language that has been added to the bill, along with language in the Committee Report accompanying <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill>, makes it clear that the designation of a National Heritage Area should not impede the development of necessary energy infrastructure. Specifically,  I understand that compromise language has been added to clarify that nothing in the bill "alters any duly adopted land use regulation, approved land use plan, or other regulatory authority (such as the authority to make safety improvements or increase the capacity of existing roads or to construct new roads) of any Federal, State, Tribal, or local agency, or conveys any land use or other regulatory authority to any local</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the bill's authors for including this important clarification.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill>, the "Celebrating America's Heritage Act," which would, in part, designate the Freedom's Way National Heritage Area in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The Freedom's Way National Heritage Area would recognize the important historical contributions made by communities throughout New England to the historic events of the American Revolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new heritage area would include the communities of Arlington, Lexington, Lincoln, Malden, Medford, and Wobum in my district along with 39 other communities throughout Massachusetts and New Hampshire that played a role in the birth of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill> would allow for cooperation between the communities in the heritage area and the National Park Service to conserve these special places and develop increased recreational and educational opportunities for these tremendous resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to support the creation of this important new National Heritage Area, which will help preserve the unique history of New England. Sometimes we forget that the small towns and cities where we were born and live are also the birthplace of this great Nation. The Freedom's Way National Heritage Area designation will ensure that future generations will be able to visit, tour and learn about the communities in New England that shaped our young Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This heritage area designation will allow for the commemoration of the important role that these New England communities played in shaping our Nation and I urge passage of the bill.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Clerk will report the motion to recommit.</chair>
  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Bishop of Utah moves to recommit the bill, <bill type="h" number="1483">H.R. 1483</bill>, to the Committee on Natural Resources with instructions to report the same to the House forthwith with the following amendment:</narrative>
  <narrative>At the end of the bill, add the following new title:</narrative>
  <narrative>All designated and future designated lands within any natural heritage area for which funding is provided under this Act shall be exclusively governed by relevant State and local laws regarding hunting, fishing, and the possession or use of a weapon, trap, or net.</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion to recommit.</chair>
  <chair/>
  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="TITLE VI--APPLICATION OF CERTAIN LAWS">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This particular motion to recommit ensures that the rights of State and local governments within heritage area designations will be able to regulate hunting and that it will be unharmed by this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill currently provides that heritage area designations shall not diminish the right of States to regulate hunting, but it is silent on the issue including the right to carry firearms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The motion to recommit also clarifies that laws regarding fishing and possession or use of a weapon or trap shall be governed exclusively by States and localities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second amendment is a critical right. We want to protect our constituents against consequences of this legislation that could harm that right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National parks have regulations that limit hunting and the right to carry or possess firearms even in States and localities where it is legally permitted. The text you see to my left is title 36 for the National Park Service Department, and this is the language that would prohibit in heritage areas those rights that even are currently allowed by State and local legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These regulations harm wildlife and the environment because even local wildlife management officials are impeded in their work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before any attempt is made to restrict the rights of gun owners and second amendment defenders, this motion to recommit protects their legal existing rights now and in the future. It is important that it be said and be said clearly.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is an issue, as is typical of a minority of the minority, that has not been mentioned one iota in any of today's debate, in any of the committee debate developed on a bipartisan, nonpartisan nature in bringing this bill to the floor, not in any way brought up in any of the extensive hearings held by our subcommittee chairman, Mr. Grijalva, and is brought up at this last second out of the clear blue, which, again, I say should not be surprising because it  is typical of a minority of the minority to make such efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I would ask the gentleman from Utah, is he referring to all Federal lands? Because as I am sure he knows, the heritage areas are not part of the national park system, the chart that he just brought forward, nor are they under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service. The heritage areas are part of a collaborative effort between Federal and State and local people with local governing units with matching dollars, not all Federal dollars, as I am sure the gentleman knows.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I ask that question. Are you intending this language for all Federal lands?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="TITLE VI--APPLICATION OF CERTAIN LAWS">
    <paragraph>As I am sure the distinguished gentleman from West Virginia knows, each and every one of the divisions within the Department of the Interior has different sets of rules and regulations. BIA land would not be a problem. A national park designation would be. So any of these heritage areas that were under the direction of the National Park Service, and there are some within this new bill, would fall under title 36. That's why this legislation desperately needs to be there,  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H11964]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, yes, it's still significant. It's still important. It needs to be there to clarify specifically. If the intent is not to change what has been happening by the locals, this clearly sets in all these areas what has been local will continue and State and local regulations will have precedence.</paragraph>
