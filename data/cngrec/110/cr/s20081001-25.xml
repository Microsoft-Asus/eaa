  <narrative>HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES -- (Senate - October 01, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10297">S10297</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="PRIVATE JORDAN P. THIBEAULT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to PVT Jordan P. Thibeault of South Jordan, UT, who recently lost his life in Iraq while serving with the 1st Armored Division.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe it is my solemn duty to learn about the lives of those Utah servicemembers who have fallen in the defense of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Looking back on the 7 years of this conflict, I have always been stuck by theses remarkable men and women. Such is the case with PVT Jordan Thibeault.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is remembered by the Utah community as a young man who grew up loving to ride bikes, act in plays, and known as a helpful and hard-working young man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was struck by the words of his family who released a statement on their son's passing. So I will take this opportunity to share with the Senate the moving words from the Thibeault family:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mankind today is faced with terrible calamities. Only a select few are willing to forgo comforts of home, indeed the very promise of a brighter future, to place themselves between the forces of hate and oppression and the human spirit yearning for peace and safety ..... [Jordan Thibeault's] passing should give hope to all that there are still those among us who are willing to give the ultimate sacrifice to keep mankind safe and free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, no truer words have been spoken on the floor of the Senate. Those eloquent words are not only a wonderful tribute but firm evidence of the quality of the family that raised such a fine man.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="MAJOR GENERAL RANDALL D. MOSLEY">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator Tester, to recognize MG Randall D. Mosley, Adjutant General for the great state of Montana. MG Randall D. Mosley has served our Nation and the State of Montana for over 38 years and has recently retired. The Montana Guard was established in 1889. Since then, few adjutant generals have faced as many challenges as Major General Mosley. We Montanans were so lucky to have such a great citizen soldier at the helm of our National  Guard. I want to take a few moments to recount the career of this great Montanan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Mosley's career is a model of public service and serves an example for all those in the military. He never backed down to any challenging issue, of which he had many. During his tenure, duty called several thousand Montana National Guard members to Iraq and Afghanistan. The deployments put great strains on the soldiers and airmen that answered the call, as well as the families of the soldiers that stayed at home. General Mosley worked tirelessly before, during, and after each deployment  to support his troops and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Mosley understood that troops returning home from overseas need the support of the whole community. General Mosley worked to improve community awareness of the challenges troops face upon returning from combat. As it became clear that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were creating new forms of injuries, he led an overhaul of Montana's postdeployment health reassessment program. General Mosley put together a task force with community leaders from around the state. The task force developed  better ways to care for his troops as they returned home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to General Mosley's leadership, the Montana National Guard has one of the best yellow-ribbon programs in the country. It is a model for the rest of the nation to follow. Improved mental health care is now available to Montana's guardsmen and their families. The Guard offers training workshops to help troops transition back to everyday life. Montanans are truly grateful to General Mosley for his leadership on this critical issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now yield to my colleague from Montana, Senator Tester.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412244" topic="MAJOR GENERAL RANDALL D. MOSLEY">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Senator Baucus. General Mosley really does embody what the National Guard is all about--the citizen soldier. For 35 years he wore the uniform of his country with great pride and honor. But he also takes tremendous pride in being from the State of Montana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Mosley's leadership also has been recognized well beyond Montana's borders. He worked with United States Central Command for over 14 years to develop Montana's partnership with the country of Kyrgyzstan. The partnership has blossomed. Leaders in Kyrgyzstan have learned many of the skills and knowledge they need to secure their country's democratic future. General Mosley also worked to help the Kyrgyzstan military develop a noncommissioned officer cadre. These leaders will help Kyrgyzstan  train and lead their soldiers now and in the future. Montana's partnership with Kyrgyzstan helped their leaders improve the cooperation between military and civilian authorities. In large measure because of General Mosley's efforts, Kyrgyzstan's military has developed strong ties with our military and has rapidly advanced to meet the challenges of the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Mosley's career reminds us all of the value of public service. We Montanans are deeply indebted to him. He is an outstanding ambassador for the citizens of Montana and the men and women of the Montana National Guard. He will be deeply missed, but we wish him well in retirement and we thank him for a lifetime of service to our State and our Nation.</paragraph>
