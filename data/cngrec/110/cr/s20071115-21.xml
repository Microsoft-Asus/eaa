    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today about the conference report for the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the efforts of Chairman Kennedy, as well as Senators ENZI, DODD and ALEXANDER, for working together to lead this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan legislation reauthorizes the Head Start program, something the Congress has not done since 1998.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1965, President Johnson launched a summer program for low-income children and their families called Project Head Start.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The program's mission was simple: to prepare low-income, preschool-aged children for success in school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Head Start serves children and their families in urban and rural areas across the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its inception, more than 20 million children and families have benefited from the Head Start program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevada's eight centers range from a Head Start and Early Head Start Center in rural Ely, to larger, more urban centers in Reno and Las Vegas, to a Tribal Head Start center in Gardnerville.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each of these programs is unique, because they focus on the needs of children and their families in the communities they serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, more than 40 years since its inception, Head Start provides comprehensive early education and health services to almost 1 million low-income preschool children to help them prepare for and succeed in school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, this is only a fraction of the number of children that could benefit from Head Start services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Nevada alone, nearly 10,000 3- and 4-year-olds are eligible for Head Start programs. But, last year, only about one quarter of those eligible were able to participate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will expand access and eligibility for low-income children and families, which will open the doors to Head Start to tens of thousands of children in Nevada and across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also makes a number of other important changes to the Head Start program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives children the tools they need to start school by aligning Head Start standards and services with State and local school standards and requiring new research-based standards and assessments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, to ensure that Head Start programs are serving children as effectively as possible, the bill requires greater accountability through improved governance and recompetition for poor performing Head Start centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill strengthens the Head Start workforce by setting new education and training goals for Head Start teachers and curriculum specialists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With proven and lasting results, Head Start is a wise investment in our future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(At the request of Mr. REID, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to celebrate the passage of the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act to reauthorize the Head Start program yesterday. This legislation is a great accomplishment for the Congress and improves opportunities for nearly a million young children and their families. Head Start represents our understanding that our children must be a top priority. While as children represent one quarter of our population, they represent 100 percent of our future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Senators KENNEDY, ENZI and ALEXANDER for their  leadership on this bill and their strong bipartisan work to complete this conference report. I also commend Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon in the House of Representatives and Congressmen KILDEE and CASTLE for their work on this reauthorization. Since 2003, the Senate HELP Committee and the House Education and Labor Committee  have worked to reauthorize this legislation. As a result of more than four years of bipartisan efforts, the conference report we adopted yesterday improves and strengthens the already successful Head Start program. I am happy with the unanimous passage of the bill and look forward to its enactment into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1965, Head Start has provided comprehensive early childhood development services to low-income children. The evidence is clear: Head Start works for the more than 900,000 children enrolled in its centers throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This conference report bolsters the comprehensive nature of Head Start that aids in the social, emotional, physical and cognitive development of low-income preschool children. The program is successful because each center works to address the needs of its local community. Head Start is more than just a school readiness program; it addresses the comprehensive needs of children and their families by providing health and other services to enrolled children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The role of parents as essential partners and decisionmakers in Head Start is also strengthened in this legislation. Families play the most important role in ensuring the success of their children, and our bill maintains an integral role for parents in the decision-making and day-to-day operations of the program. Parent involvement is a centerpiece of Head Start and I believe this bill strengthens their critical role.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Expanded eligibility, improved accountability, strengthened school readiness for children and enhanced teacher quality are some of the essential elements of this legislation. In addition, collaboration and coordination with other early childhood development programs and outreach to underserved populations is greatly improved. The legislation before us significantly increases resources for Indian Head Start and Migrant and Seasonal Head Start. In addition, Early Head Start is prioritized, so that  thousands of additional infants and toddlers will be served. We know that major brain development occurs in the first 3 years of life and I am thrilled that we are putting research into practice by expanding Early Head Start.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference report will enable more low-income children to get a head start by allowing programs to serve families with incomes up to 130 percent of the poverty level, while ensuring that the most vulnerable families below the poverty level are served first. This is important for Connecticut and other States where the cost of living is especially high and many working poor families aren't able to access services because they earn just above the poverty level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although we do not go as far as I would personally like to see in funding for Head Start, we do authorize additional resources in this bill. Despite the tight budget situation, we authorize an increase of six percent from $6.9 billion to $7.35 billion in fiscal year 2008, to $7.65 billion in fiscal year 2009 and to $7.995 billion in fiscal year 2009. I continue to be gravely concerned about the lack of resources for Head Start--funding levels have been essentially flat since 2002. Currently,  only half of eligible children are served in Head Start and fewer than 5 percent are served in Early Head Start. The increased funding authorized by this bill will help us to begin to close this gap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Across the country, Head Start providers are reporting rising costs in transportation health care premiums, facilities maintenance and training for staff. Rising operating costs are coinciding with decreasing state, local and private contributions to Head Start programs. We address these needs by ensuring that all Head Start programs receive a cost of living increase, tied to inflation, each year that funds are available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Research shows that child outcomes are directly related to the quality of the teachers and professionals who work with them on a daily basis. I am pleased that in the bill we establish strong educational standards for Head Start teachers, curriculum specialists and teacher assistants. In 6 years, all Head Start teachers will be required to have an associate's degree and 50 percent of teachers will be required to have a bachelor's degree. I will continue to work toward increased funding to assist  teachers in pursuing additional educational goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Head Start began more than 40 years ago, it was the only preschool program available for low-income children; now there are many approaches. Collaboration and coordination with other early childhood programs is also an essential piece of this Head Start bill, reducing duplication and encouraging opportunities for shared information and resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation represents an important step forward and I welcome our continued focus on the needs of our Nation's children.</paragraph>
