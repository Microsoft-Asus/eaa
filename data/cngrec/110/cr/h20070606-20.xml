    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise to voice my strong disapproval of the Supreme Court's decision last week that effectively endorsed pay discrimination against women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pay equity is a problem for women around the country, but especially for women of color, women who look like me. On average, African American women earn only 64 cents for every dollar and Latinas earn only 52 cents on the dollar compared to their white male counterparts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to protect the rights of workers, to remedy wage discrimination, and do more to close the pay gap between men and women. That is why I cosponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would give teeth to the Equal Pay Act. The Paycheck Fairness Act would entitle the plaintiffs to backpay, compensatory, and punitive damages for "intentional" wage discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without serious penalties for wage discrimination, violations will continue and working men and women and their families will suffer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can and must fix the Equal Pay Act so workers all around can be fairly compensated for wage discrimination, and we must pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to close the wage gap.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
