  <speaking speaker="412243" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this afternoon I will have the glorious opportunity to travel to the White House to celebrate the 2006 World Champion St. Louis Cardinals, and the echoes of the cheers of St. Louis I will hear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But today there are even stronger cheers coming from the angels in Heaven because today the angels in Heaven are cheering for a lifetime of kindness and compassion that belonged to the Missouri legend, Larry Stewart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Larry was known by many names--dad, son, husband, friend--but his favorite name was Secret Santa. This was a title that was given him by hundreds and thousands of anonymous people he had helped over the 26 years that he had a very special way of celebrating our Christmas holiday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Larry Stewart knew something of the life of those he had helped, but like any legendary, larger-than-life superhero, he remained mysteriously anonymous until the closing days of his life. He grew up poor in Mississippi, later telling stories about how he resorted to sleeping in his car early on just to get by. He, in fact, was homeless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He told a story of how in 1971 he was eating in a diner, and when the time came to pay for his meal, he realized he didn't have the money. He saw a $20 bill had been dropped next to him on the counter, and he got the attention of the man he had seen drop the $20 bill. The man turned out to be the owner, and the $20 bill had been dropped on purpose. It was a subtle gift trying to not make Larry Stewart feel uncomfortable about not having the money to pay for his meal. Larry Stewart would never  forget that moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Years later in 1979, well into his career as a businessman, he faced his second Christmas season unemployed. Worried about how he was going to take care of his young family and receiving the news that he had just lost another job, he saw a carhop working outside in the cold with very little to keep her warm. Faced with the situation that his problems were not as serious as hers, he gave the woman a $20 tip, and the joy that $20 tip gave him began a tradition that lasted the next 26 years of his  life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was lucky enough to be in his very wide circle of friends in Kansas City. I was even more fortunate because there was a time when he turned to me and said: Claire, would you like to go on a sleigh ride?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said of course, welcoming the opportunity to see Larry Stewart do what really no one else realized he was doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sleigh ride went something like this: We met at Larry's home early in the morning near Christmas. He wore always white overalls--he was a big man--white overalls with a bright red flannel shirt. We would sit in his kitchen drinking coffee. He would be exuberant with excitement as to what was going to happen that day. He would stuff his pockets with mountains of cash. His dear friend, Tom Phillips--then a sheriff's deputy, now the sheriff of Jackson County--would accompany us to make sure  that our journey was safe, and off we would go in a large Suburban with another few fortunate friends to watch Santa do his work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He had a method. I asked him one time: Larry, how do you decide where you go to spread this money?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said: I try to go places where people are doing  their best to get by.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we would travel to autopart stores where people at the Christmas season were trying to buy that battery to make that car work. We would travel to bus stops where he would love to find people dressed in fast-food uniforms trying to catch a bus to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Suburban would slow down, and Larry would hop out. We would all get out. Quickly he would approach the people and stuff $100 bills in their hands and say: Merry Christmas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Astonished, these people would look up suspiciously, thinking that maybe something was wrong. Then they realized: It was just a wonderful, kind man spreading Christmas cheer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We would go into laundromats. We would go into 7-Elevens. We would go anywhere that Larry thought he would find people who were doing their best and having a difficult time making ends meet during the holiday season. I watched Larry Stewart hand out thousands and thousands of dollars to people who were astonished at his generosity, strangers he had never seen before and would never see again. Every Christmas, year after year, this was his tradition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those sleigh rides I took with Larry Stewart are some of the most memorable days of my life. I will never forget the feelings that washed over me as I watched the true spirit of Christmas in operation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On every sleigh ride he would always find some special recipients. This was research he did ahead of time, trying to find families who were really in need. The stories that I have to tell of those special moments I can literally cry thinking of what I witnessed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember one instance where we drove to the suburbs of Kansas City and pulled up in front of a very modest home. I asked Larry what he was doing. He explained to me that there was a woman who lived in this house who had to get dialysis three times a week. She lived with her daughter. Her daughter was a single mom with three kids. They had a broken down van, and her daughter would have to arrange her three jobs she worked to try to take her mother into Kansas City for dialysis, and invariably  the van would break down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Larry heard about this situation, and this was going to be one of his special Christmas gifts. He had a van outfitted with a handicap ramp for her wheelchair, a brandnew van, and he had it fixed up with a giant red bow. He had someone driving it who had a remote-controlled walkie-talkie.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Up we go to the front door of this house. Larry pounds on the door in his white overalls and red flannel shirt, and peeking through the door is the very suspicious daughter. I am standing over to the side watching all this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Larry says to this woman: Merry Christmas. I hear that you are having a  hard time getting your mom to dialysis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You can hear her mother in the background saying: Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? Her mother, with difficulty, comes to the door and is standing just behind her daughter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This daughter says: Yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You can see the broken down van in the driveway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Larry says: I want to try to help to see if we can't get your mom to dialysis with a little more reliability, and with that he talks into the walkie-talkie and says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bring it around. And around the corner comes the new van with a big red ribbon on it. It pulls into the driveway, and with that, Larry hands the daughter an envelope with $10,000 in cash in it and says: Merry Christmas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He walks away and says: The title is in the van.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, you can imagine the reaction of these women--shocked, surprised, joy. And, of course, I am balling like a baby standing there, as all of us were. There were about four of us who watched this event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is just one story I can tell, but imagine having the privilege of seeing that kind of scene played over and over several years in a row when I was fortunate enough to be on the sleigh ride. This was an extraordinary man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the time he was playing Secret Santa in Kansas City and across our country, he gave out $1.3 million in cash. Kansas City was lucky enough to receive most of his gifts, but he also landed his sleigh frequently in his home State of Mississippi, Florida after the hurricanes, New Orleans after Katrina, New York after 9/11, and this past Christmas, his last, knowing that it was probably his last, he traveled to Chicago to spread cheer around his dear friend Buck O'Neil's neighborhood where  Buck O'Neil grew up poor. Buck O'Neil was one of his best friends and, of course, another Kansas City legend we lost last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He told the public about his role as Secret Santa last Christmas, so the world knew who Secret Santa finally was. Thousands of people who received his generous spirit contacted him in the closing days of his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He called me on Christmas Eve to say this was the most special Christmas of all because of the outpouring of love he had felt from all of the people he had helped over the years. What Mr. Stewart, who had built a fortune from nothing, may have seen as a small holiday gift was actually a gesture of compassion so few experience or ever understand due to the frenetic pace of our lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Known by his family and friends and colleagues for a soul born of kindness and warmth and a personality as unassuming as his generosity was great, Larry kept his identity under wraps until this year. He was diagnosed with esophageal cancer and in his last months his identity was revealed. When word spread, he was flooded with national media attention about which he could care less. Frankly, he didn't even want to handle it. But he was excited because he realized he had an opportunity to spread  what he had done to others and hopefully have it catch on. He loved hearing the stories, but he continually said to all of us this was not about him. It was God's work. He was merely a servant of his Lord.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the Senate to join me in honoring and celebrating the life of Larry Stewart, Missouri's own Secret Santa. I ask that this distinguished body join me in extending our greatest sympathies to his family: Paulette, Joe, John, Kim, and Mark, and the thousands who, like me, were fortunate enough to call him a dear friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Stewart's gifts of hope touched many recipients. However, the compassion that drove his generosity was contagious to all who knew him and that was even a greater gift. As we honor Larry today, let us rejoice in his life, remember his kindness, his sense of humor, and revel in his generosity. He was Santa. He was real, right down to the twinkle in his eye. He loved others as the good Lord intended. May his legacy of kindness always be a reminder to us all to spread hope and compassion to one  another.</paragraph>
