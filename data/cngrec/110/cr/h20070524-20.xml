  <speaking speaker="400638" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are two sets of issues coming before this Congress before we finish up our work this week. One is the President's request for a blank check to finance this war for the remainder of this fiscal year. I cannot and will not support that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This House will also consider funding for children's health insurance, gulf coast recovery and drought relief for our farmers. I will indeed support that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have put forth a plan in this House to the President. He has rejected it time and time again. I will continue to fight. Even though this proposal before the Congress today provides benchmarks, it is not enough. Even though it requires reports to Congress in July and September, it is not enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My pledge is for a new direction to turn this war around, to bring stronger accountability, stronger support for our troops, and bring them home safe, sound and soon.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
