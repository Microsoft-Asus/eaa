  <speaking speaker="400658" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, General Petraeus presented Congress with the progress report that we requested. Rather than encountering a fair dialogue on the situation in Iraq,  he was confronted with an accusation of treason by one of the Nation's most prominent and well-funded liberal advocacy organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week the Senate took the appropriate course of action to officially, and in a bipartisan fashion, condemn this atrocious act on a distinguished war hero. I call on the Democrat leadership to follow the Senate's lead and allow for consideration of House Resolution 644.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The men and women of our Armed Forces have committed themselves to the defense of this Nation. I ask my colleagues, who will come to their defense when their integrity and patriotism come under attack?</paragraph>
