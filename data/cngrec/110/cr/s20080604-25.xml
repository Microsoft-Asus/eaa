  <narrative>REMEMBERING JOHN W. KEYS, III -- (Senate - June 04, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5029">S5029</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today on a sad note--to inform the Senate of the recent death of a model public servant who served our country well. John W. Keys, III, was the 16th Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation. He served in that capacity from July 17, 2001, to April 15, 2006, and worked closely with the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources which I have the privilege of chairing. Commissioner Keys retired 2 years ago to return to Utah and pursue his favorite pastimes which  included flying. Tragically, he was killed on May 30, 2008, when the airplane he was piloting crashed in Canyonlands National Park, UT, with one passenger aboard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Commissioner Keys' appointment by President Bush to lead the Bureau of Reclamation was actually his second stint with the agency. He returned to Federal service after previously retiring from a 34-year career with reclamation. During that time, he worked as a civil and hydraulic engineer in various positions throughout the western United States. Ultimately, he served as reclamation's Pacific Northwest regional director for 12 years before his initial retirement in 1998.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Commissioner Keys was a dedicated public servant whose knowledge, experience, and demeanor were key factors in his successful leadership of the Bureau of Reclamation. Those same skills, combined with his willingness to work with Congress on a bipartisan basis, were instrumental in addressing a wide range of water resource issues across the West. He will be sorely missed, but left a legacy of accomplishments that will ensure that he is long-remembered. I offer my condolences to his wife, Dell,  and their daughters, Cathy and Robyn.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of John W. Keys, III, who died tragically in a plane crash on Friday, May 30, 2008. John was a long-time Federal official, and a kind and thoughtful man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Keys was born in Sheffield, AL. He earned a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology and a master's degree from Brigham Young University. John was dedicated to his community, and spent much of his spare time serving as a search-and-rescue pilot for Utah County and as a college and high school football referee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority of John Keys' life, however, was centered on his marriage to his wife Dell and his professional career at the Bureau of Reclamation, an agency of the Department of the Interior. John spent nearly 40 years working with Reclamation. From 1964 to 1979, he worked as a civil and hydraulic engineer in the Great Basin, Missouri River Basin, Colorado River Basin, and Columbia River Basin. I first met John when he served as Reclamation's Pacific Northwest regional director. In 1995, he was  awarded Interior's highest honor--the Distinguished Service Award--for maintaining open lines of communication and keeping interest groups focused on solutions. After 12 years as Northwest regional director, John retired in 1998.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2001, John emerged from retirement to take a position as the 16th Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation. As Commissioner, John oversaw a venerable agency charged with the operation and maintenance of water storage, water distribution, and electric power generation facilities in 17 Western States. John placed great emphasis on operating and maintaining Reclamation projects to ensure continued delivery of water and power benefits to the public, consistent with environmental and other requirements.  He was committed to honoring State water rights, interstate compacts, and contracts with Reclamation's users. This commitment helped the agency develop creative solutions to address the water resource challenges of the West.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John had retired as Commissioner in 2006. He was a highly respected and dedicated public servant. I stand today to express my appreciation for his service to the Northwest and to our country. I want to offer my sincere condolences to his wife, his daughters, and those he leaves behind.</paragraph>
