  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Thanksgiving Day, as my colleague just mentioned, is next week and we have the threat of another Presidential veto to deny 10 million children across this country of all races, all poor, access to health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has become a born-again fiscal conservative, disregarding any requirement that we pay for the war and disregarding the fact that we are paying for children's health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Thanksgiving Day, all of us are thankful, those of us who have health care, and we are determined that the children of this country will join the Members of Congress in this country, government employees, and citizens across this country who do have access to health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has refused to meet with congressional leaders. And, by the way, this is bipartisan. Republicans and Democrats in this body stand united in wanting to insure our kids, and the only obstacle is the Presidential veto.</paragraph>
