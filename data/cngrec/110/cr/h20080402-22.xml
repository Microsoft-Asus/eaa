    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, all across America and Wisconsin, people are demanding lower gas prices and affordable health care, not more debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent weeks, our Nation has experienced a dramatic decline in home values. And when our home values decline and disappear, so does the tax revenue in every town, in every county, in every State of the Union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our very way of life is now at risk due to this administration's continued economic policy of borrow and spend, and last weekend the administration forced us to swallow a minnow with worms by nationalizing the debt of financial institutions, guaranteeing their debts will be paid by American taxpayers. Whose side are they on? Taxpayers invested in their own homes, not in insider Wall Street deals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This administration is in bed with big banks, big insurance, and Big Oil, and businesses who are shipping our jobs overseas. If this administration was on the side of taxpayers, what would they do? They would cut the price of gasoline. Wisconsin wants lower gas prices, not more debt.</paragraph>
