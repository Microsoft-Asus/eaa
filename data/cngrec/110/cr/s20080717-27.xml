    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak about two judicial nominees who were approved by this Chamber a few hours ago, both from my home State of New York. Happily, earlier today, they were confirmed by voice vote to be district judges in the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York. Both of these nominees, Magistrate Judge Kiyo Matsumoto and Paul  Gardephe, were rated unanimously "well qualified" by the American Bar Association, and both were  unanimously reported out of the Judiciary Committee before they were confirmed today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In New York, we have actually worked out a wonderful system for nominating judges to the district and circuit courts in which the President and I have worked extremely well together to name mainstream, consensus candidates to the Federal bench such as these two nominees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of my Republican friends were here on the floor earlier making all kinds of assertions about the judicial nominations process. Undoubtedly, there has been rancor when it comes to judges from other parts of the country, but it doesn't have to be that way. When the administration works closely and cooperatively with home State Senators, as we have done in New York, things work out extremely well. Highly qualified, mainstream judges, not too far on either side, are approved--some nominated  by the President and some nominated by the Senators from New York. In my State, we work well together. The results are not only mainstream consensus nominees but mainstream consensus nominees without the acrimony. Two of the consensus nominees were before us earlier today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly pleased to support Judge Matsumoto in the Eastern District to be judge because I personally recommended her to the President. When I interviewed her, I was deeply impressed by her poise, intellect, temperament, and thoughtfulness. The sitting judges in the district speak extremely highly of her, and her record of public service and accomplishment speaks for itself. Her confirmation, moreover, is historic. She now becomes only the second Asian-American woman ever to be confirmed  to the Federal bench. We hope another and another and another will come soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Matsumoto graduated with high honors from the University of California at Berkeley and received her J.D. from Georgetown. Her distinguished career has included work in the private sector, in academia, and public service. For years, Judge Matsumoto has been a well-respected Federal magistrate judge in the Eastern District. In fact, on only one occasion has a reviewing district court judge declined to adopt Judge Matsumoto's report or recommendations. That is an extremely impressive record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not only proud to support the nomination of Judge Matsumoto because of her integrity and qualifications but also because I believe she will contribute to a diversity of perspectives on the Federal bench. I have always believed that our Federal bench should reflect the same broad diversity of experience as America writ large. I have endeavored to add minorities to the benches of New York State. I am endeavoring now to add women as well because fewer than one-third of sitting judges in the  Eastern District are women, and Judge Matsumoto will help narrow the gap. I have also nominated a woman to sit in the Southern District whom, hopefully, we will nominate next week, as she was approved by the Judiciary Committee unanimously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, there is an unfortunate underrepresentation of Asian Americans on the bench. With her confirmation, Judge Matsumoto becomes only the third Asian-American Federal judge outside of the Ninth Circuit and only the second ever in New York. The only other, Denny Chin, was confirmed to the Southern District bench 14 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Matsumoto has received the enthusiastic support of other groups, including the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association. They call Judge Matsumoto's nomination "a potential milestone for the Asian Pacific American community." I couldn't agree more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Matsumoto's father and mother, merely because they were of Japanese descent, were forcibly removed to an internment camp during World War II. Fifty years later, their daughter ascends to the Federal bench. This shows that in America, we make our mistakes, but we also have greatness. Judge Matsumoto's life and career show the greatness of those who believe in America and push our Nation to its best potential. The woman whose family was subject to the worst injustice under law, now, as a  result of her own talent and hard work, has a seat of legal power to judge others with intellectual excellence and fairness. God bless America for these kinds of things that happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would like to say a few words in favor of Judge Paul Gardephe, who was earlier confirmed as a judge in the Southern District of New York. Mr. Gardephe has an impressive and eclectic legal resume that includes work in both the public and private sector, work on criminal prosecution, criminal defense, civil litigation, and corporate law. He is a magna cum laude graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia Law School. He served as a law clerk to Judge Engel on the Sixth Circuit,  has spent 9 years as a prosecutor in the Southern District, and worked as deputy general counsel for Time, Inc. Mr. Gardephe also worked for the inspector general in the Department of Justice, where he was involved in the review of the Department's performance in the Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames spying cases. Mr. Gardephe was also honored with the Thurgood Marshall Award for his work representing a death row inmate pro bono.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I decide whether to support a nominee to the Federal bench, the most important criteria to me is this: Is the nominee an ideologue or will the nominee place the rule of law ahead of his or her own personal ideological views? I believe both of these nominees will make excellent judges who will be impartial and thoughtful guardians of the rule of law. I am pleased that my colleagues voted to confirm both of them. I heartily congratulate the nominees and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think we all agree that balancing environmental with energy goals can be a challenge, but it is a challenge we must confront now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of this body have discussed various proposals to regulate the output of greenhouse gases. Some advocate doing it though a cap-and-trade approach. Others have advocated a carbon tax. Such proposals are aimed at limiting future carbon output into the atmosphere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Discussion and debate is not enough. We need action now. One resource often overlooked is coal. Despite the recent pace in developing clean coal technologies, America cannot afford to simply give up on this challenge. Coal is an abundant, affordable, reliable, and secure energy source. It has the potential to become an even cleaner fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe another solution to protect our environment and our economy can be found in the GEAR Act. This bill takes a new look at climate change by tapping into human potential and the American spirit to develop the technological solutions we need to address climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, there was a very thoughtful editorial written by Shawn Taylor which was printed in the "Wyoming Livestock Roundup" on July 12, 2008. Shawn is the executive director of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association. I believe he does a terrific job of summing up the feelings of Wyoming people on the need to take action balancing climate change goals while keeping bills affordable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have the editorial to which I referred printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>(By Shawn Taylor)</narrative>
  <narrative>Is the sky falling? In the past I would have responded to this question by saying, "It depends on whom you ask," but in today's world you'll be hard pressed to find anyone involved in the energy/environmental/business/agriculture, etc. industries that would argue with Chicken Little.</narrative>
  <narrative>Whether you agree with those who subscribe to the man-made global warming theory, or those who think the status quo is acceptable, or somewhere in between, you can find a scientist with numbers to argue your case. But I would like to try to focus on some political, physical and, economic realities.</narrative>
  <narrative>First, pressure is mounting in Congress to do something about climate change. Both presidential candidates have stated they support a cap and trade approach to curb emissions of carbon dioxide. While political debates in Washington, D.C. may seem far away the outcome will have a direct impact on you, whether you're in the agriculture industry, a small business owner or just own a house and have to pay your utility bill.</narrative>
  <narrative>Experts now say some areas of the country will be short of power within one or two years. Climate change is but one aspect of a looming energy crisis created by increasing demand and decreasing capacity to meet that demand.</narrative>
  <narrative>While Wyoming's elected representatives in D.C. are sympathetic and understand these issues, many in D.C. aren't spending a lot of time on the energy supply issue. The desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions quickly without regard to our national economy and giving short shrift to technology-driven solutions, and the growing demand for power are about to collide and form, excuse the clich&#xE9;, the perfect storm.</narrative>
  <narrative>Second, while all Americans need to start being more efficient with their energy usage, energy conservation cannot meet the nation's power needs alone. While the development of more renewable resources helps diversify and strengthen our energy supplies, they are not the silver bullet solution to climate change. We need everything we can get our hands on in the near future, just to keep the lights on, to say nothing of a long-term energy policy.</narrative>
  <narrative>Third, to avert an energy crisis, the federal government must exercise true leadership. Without that leadership--without a sound, responsible plan--government risks not only the reliability of our electric system, but literally the ability of many Americans to be able to afford to pay their electric bill. Consumers could be paying a higher bill each month without the guarantee the lights will stay on.</narrative>
  <narrative>Folks in Wyoming and across the country need to start a dialogue with their elected officials at every  level by asking the following questions:</narrative>
  <narrative>Balancing electricity needs and environmental goals will be difficult. How much is this effort going to increase my electric bill; what will you do to make it affordable; and in the end, will these emissions reduction goals have a global impact?</narrative>
  <narrative>Experts say our nation's growing electricity needs will soon go well beyond what renewable energy and energy conservation and efficiency can provide. What is your plan to make sure we have the electricity we'll need in the future? What are you doing to fully fund the research required to make emissions free electric plants an affordable reality?</narrative>
  <narrative>I encourage you to contact your representatives and senators and ask them these questions and ask they pose the same questions to their colleagues.</narrative>
  <narrative>You don't need to be an energy expert to ask questions. You I do need to be aware you may not be able to pay your utility bill in the future, or that there might not even be a utility bill to pay! Asking questions helps find the answers to solve the problem of balancing climate change goals while keeping your electricity reliable and your bills affordable.</narrative>
  <narrative>Right now members of Congress, as well as state elected officials, are hearing from lots of different interest groups with ideas about how to address climate change or global warming or emissions reductions, whatever you want to call it. While I write this as the Executive Director of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association, the problems we face are pretty much universal, and the one group that, to date, has been left out of the conversation is the consumer. We need a plan people can live with  today while we deal with the long-term issue of balancing energy policy and environmental policy.</narrative>
  <narrative>To make things easy there is a website to allow you, the consumer, to contact your Congressional delegation and ask them the questions mentioned above. The website www.ourenergy.coop was established by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association but you don't have to be a member of a co-op to ask these questions, you just have to be concerned about the approach D.C. is taking.</narrative>
  <narrative>Policy makers far too often don't ask questions until something goes wrong. We believe it makes sense to know the answers before the laws are passed. You can help your elected officials and yourself by having this conversation.</narrative>
