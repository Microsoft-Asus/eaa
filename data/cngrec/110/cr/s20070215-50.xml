    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge the bicentennial of St. Martin Parish. As one of the original 19 parishes created from the Territory of Orleans, St. Martin will celebrate its 200th anniversary in 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>St. Martin Parish was initially established in 1756 by the French Government as the "Postes des Attakapas." It was originally the site of an Indian trading post and was later turned into a Spanish military-administrative center. In 1807, when the Territory of Orleans was divided into the original 19 parishes, St. Martin Parish was the last to be created. The parish at that time included the present parishes of St. Martin, St. Mary, Lafayette, Vermillion, and Iberia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The structure of St. Martin Parish has remained virtually unchanged since 1868. It is divided by an arm of Iberia Parish into the upper and lower portions of the parish. The upper portion consists of the communities of St. Martinville, Breaux Bridge, Parks, Henderson, and a portion of Arnaudville. The lower portion borders the East Atchafalaya Basin Levee and consists of the unincorporated areas of Stephensville and Belle River.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A population rich in diversity and cultural theory calls St. Martin Parish home. In the late 1700s, 3,000 French Canadians fled British persecution, finding refuge in south Louisiana. The birth of Acadiana can be attributed to the settling of 200 of these refugees in present day St. Martinville in 1765. There, the Acadians were introduced to enslaved Africans tending cattle for French landowners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Refugees fleeing the French Revolution as well as Spanish-speaking Malagans also arrived in the settlement. Creole families from New Orleans and Mobile along with Anglo-Americans soon followed. German wheat farmers trying to find a place in the rice industry, along with Italian merchants and Irish workers building the railroads began to call St. Martin Parish home in the 1880s. These founding cultures, French, Acadian, African, Italian, and Spanish, have maintained their cultural identities while  simultaneously blending together to form one culture that is uniquely St. Martin Parish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>St. Martin Parish encompasses the copious and picturesque regions that extend from the Bayou Teche to the Atchafalaya Basin. An agriculturally prosperous area, St. Martin Parish is comprised of sugar cane fields, low-lying swamps, and majestic waterways. Regal oak trees draped with moss frame passageways throughout the parish. With its distinctive cultures and striking scenery, St. Martin Parish has come to embody the definition of the Louisiana way of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I would like to applaud the good people of St. Martin Parish on the bicentennial and wish them continued prosperity.</paragraph>
